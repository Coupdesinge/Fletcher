VUnreal - just go, especially if you are a tourist.  I never in my life realized just how many types of cacti there were until I went here and the educational aspects of the Desert Botanical Garden are myriad without being preachy.  Yes it is hot, but shade is available and drinking fountains abound.

VReally nice zoo with a layout that proves quite conducive to getting close to the animals but I must say the nickel and diming is a bit off-putting; $3 to look at Stingrays, $5 to pet a giraffe, $6 for a wheelchair, etc - it is a wonder they don't charge you to park.  Good collection and a nice layout, but not necessarily a 'top tier' zoo despite the $20 admission price.

VWith a few hours past and a few tasks accomplished the next stop of my day would be at Pane Bianco - the sandwich shop from the Valley's most celebrated Chef, Chris Bianco.  Having made my pilgrimage to the eponymous pizzeria during my first trip to Phoenix, Pane had been on my radar since the day I moved to town but given the lunch-only hours and my office location in North Scottsdale I knew a weekend would be best and as luck would have it a new website (http://www.pizzeriabianco.com/) and seven day 11a-3p schedule had been rolled out just the week prior.\u000a\u000aArriving at the surprisingly large space (especially when compared to Matt's and JoBot from earlier that day - and compared to Pizzeria Bianco as well) shortly after 11:30 and allocating parking in the free lot juxtaposing the Light Rail I debated for a moment whether dine-in or to-go was best and opting for the former made my way into the restaurant where two couples already sat.  Greeted by one of two servers it was suggested I could take "any seat I wanted" and opting for a bench in the center of the room where a menu awaited I sat down to browse the menu as well as the daily specials listed on the chalkboard - almost all sounding appealing, but a bit different than the Saturday special listed on the website.  With a small list of beverages available I was asked soon if I was ready to order or if I needed a few minutes I deferred and requested a glass of water that would never reach even half-empty despite me drinking from it consistently and the restaurant soon filling to capacity.\u000a\u000aHaving debated the specials but eventually undeterred from the reason I'd come in the first place I soon placed my order for a sandwich and an 'appetizer' which I was told would be 'just a few minutes' and as while I waited I checked out the small market at the Take Away section featuring the famous focaccia, cans of tomatoes, dried pasta, and apparel before returning to my seat where my items would arrive shortly - the first a Manchego and Tomato Sauce Focaccia del Giorno featuring Bianco's delectable wood fired focaccia in all of its spongy glory topped with sweet, ripe tomatoes and an ample layer of briny Manchego; at $4.50 probably the most expensive "Grandma Slice" I've ever had yet at the same time also probably the best...or at least on par with that at DiFara in Brooklyn for best of its genre.\u000a\u000aMoving next to the original target of my desire, a sandwich of Bianco's House Made Mozzarella, Tomatoes, and Basil on Wood Fired Focaccia my first thought was "wow - that is a lot of cheese" while my second, after a bite, was "wow - that is a lot of flavor."  Perhaps as pure of a sandwich as you can find and the result of exquisite ingredients on top quality bread there is really nothing 'special' about the composition of this sandwich aside from the fact that it simply works - a largely unmanipulated masterpiece only improved by a touch of sea salt and cracked black pepper.\u000a\u000aLargely unaware on entering that Pane serves dessert it was with much delight that I realized soon after sitting down that three options were available that day and while the flourless chocolate cake I saw emerge from the kitchen to the table next to me looked quite nice there was simply no way I was passing up the Organic Vanilla Bean Rice Pudding with Candied Pecans - another simplistic stunner with creamy Arborio rice imbued with a rich vanilla custard flicked with whole vanilla beans and a few pecans for crunch.  Delicate and smooth, flavorful without being overly sweet, and *almost* thick enough to stand a spoon up straight it was not quite the best rice pudding I've ever had - but a top five contender without a shadow of a doubt - a reason in and of itself to return to Pane Bianco...though to be fair, if I returned it would take pretty spectacular daily specials to prevent me from ordering the exact same trio of items once again.  With Chris and his team now two for two it is only a matter of time before I make my way to Italian Restaurant... and honestly, that time is likely measured in hours and days as opposed to weeks and months.

VI'll move this from a 1 star review to a 2 only because the young man helping me out was friendly - the rest of the experience was a damned disaster.\u000a\u000aPros:\u000a+ They changed my Oil.\u000a+ Previously mentioned worker was friendly.\u000a\u000aCons:\u000a-$140 for oil, tire rotation, air filter.\u000a-97 minutes from the time I pulled up till the time I left.\u000a-Restroom (air conditioned) smells better than the lobby (not air conditioned)\u000a-Roaches (both in the restroom and lobby)\u000a-$1.50 for a can of soda (only cold thing in the lobby)\u000a-Television in the lobby set at volume of 50, buttons broken so it cannot be turned off, turned down, or have the channel changed from Zoomba infomercials.\u000a-I was not allowed to drive my car into the shop - I had to let a sweaty greasemonkey do that.  He was literally dripping wet.\u000a- Have already sent three pieces of spam to my e-mail box despite not saying they'd do so when asking for my e-mail.

VThere really isn't much I like about Michael's to begin with - I especially dislike them for using my name and putting on such an inferior showing - but this location was a particular disaster.  Clean up your aisles for goodness sake, I feel claustrophobic with all the crap hanging around - its like the clothing section at K-Mart, but possibly worse.

VWhile I cannot say I have any love for the Biltmore, I do have a lot of affection for Cole Haan no matter where it is located and between the friendly staff, great holiday deals, and top quality shoes I'd be lying if I didn't admit to spending far more time and money at this particular location than I should.  From the Lunargrands to the reflectives and from Wingtips to loafers there is something to be said for any brand that makes shoes that fit with such uniformity and for someone who spends the better part of twelve hours a day on his feet either running or in a professional setting the transferability of CH to Nike is something that cannot and should not be overlooked.

V...the Saturday Market is awesome - except for the baked goods from Vincent's.  A $2.50 Almond Croissant that was 1/2 the size of my palm, lacking in flavor, and ice cold?  No.  Sorry.  No.  As a matter of fact, it was the worst almond croissant I have ever eaten.\u000a\u000aThe bread pudding was slightly better and the duck and pork tamales are actually quite good.  The overall "Saturday Market" is a nice place, but the products from Vincent's Market Bistro only make me wish I'd have just gone to Tammie Coe, La Grande Orange, or so many others instead.

VNever one to let the idea of three square meals a day deter me from enjoying a visit to a new city my three plus days in Phoenix, Scottsdale, Glendale, and Chandler would additionally lead me to a number of ancillary eats - some upscale and French, some down n' dirty Southwest, some new, some old, some hot, and some cold.  Beginning first with my love of pastries, the first of these six stops would be at the combined grocery, café, bakery, liquor store, souvenir stand, and pizza parlor that is La Grande Orange Grocery; the sort of place you have to see to believe yet the sort of place where it all seems to "fit."\u000a\u000aHarbored in a small strip mall with plenty of parking plus curbside checkout for those on the go I made my way into La Grande Orange only half knowing what to expect and having already mentioned the commodities entailed the only thing I could think of when I entered the door was a trip to Whole Foods if you condensed the entirety of one store into a space approximately one quarter the size.  With cups to one side and cupcakes to the other, wine to my right and coffee to my left my first impression was one of total sensory overload yet at the same once I entered and started to browse I detected a sort of controlled chaos as the various lines moved toward their destination with a good flow.  \u000a\u000aHaving already eaten breakfast and had plenty of coffee with pizza plans at Bianco for later in the day I took my time investigating the space - children's toys, shirts, travel mugs, cheeses, pre-made salads, locally roasted coffees - before finally approaching the pastry counter to browse the cornucopia of goods.  With many items baked in house and others provided by Tammie Coe Bakery two doors down I weighed the options carefully while additionally gauging my hunger and although any number of the options sounded delectable I ended up settling for two; one my own choice and a sort of obligation at this point and the other a recommendation from the young woman at the counter as "the best thing in the world;" a promise I told her I'd hold her to if she was wrong, and after paying the modest tab I made my way to the street with my choices packed up (ostensibly for later, but in reality for enjoyment less than thirty minutes later as I checked into my hotel.)\u000a\u000aBeginning first with my selection, La Grande Orange's very own Red Velvet Cupcake, this large specimen wrapped in red wax paper and topped with an ample pile of cream cheese frosting would prove to be one of the better Red Velvets I've had in some time save for the stellar version at Bouchon Bakery just one month prior.  Loaded with notes of cocoa and sugar plus the faint taste of cinnamon and what I'm pretty sure was clove I really enjoyed the subtle nuance to this cake and despite the $3.95 price tag the portion was substantially larger and the cake significantly more moist than more expensive versions in other major cities.\u000a\u000aMoving next to the suggestion of my cashier, the Tammie Coe Crumb Bun, I really was not sure what to expect of the $2.50 option but what I received, while not the best thing in the world, was without a doubt the best sweet I had on my visit to Arizona.  Beginning first with the exterior, this golden biscuit looked something like a cinnamon roll meets a scone with a spiral texture encased in crystal sugar, but digging deeper and peeling off a layer the texture was instead somewhat akin to the famous Breton Kouign Amann kissed with cinnamon and topped with streusel.  Layer after buttery layer, bite after yeasty bite, and making a mess of the carpet (crumb bun indeed) all the while all I can say is that if you find yourself in the Phoenix area this is a must try and given the quality of both selections I was lucky to be staying so far from La Grande Orange and Tammie Coe because otherwise I'd have gone back for more.

VI generally don't visit the same place more than once - a quick glance at my blog would prove this point; Alinea, Eleven Madison Park, Bouchon Bakery, and The Griddle Café round out a list of spots that I've  experience, and the people made me want to go back as soon as I walked out the door.  Sure there have been other restaurants that have stirred such emotions but for whatever reason - generally distance or a desire to try something new - I have not yet had the opportunity.  With that said, I've now been to La Grande Orange Grocery and Pizzeria four times in four months and if you count Chelsea's kitchen as part of the LGO empire that number becomes five - the most times I've been to any single space except perhaps the quick casual and fast food restaurants I frequented during my childhood and early years of college.\u000a\u000aDescribed simply as "an organic coffee and breakfast bar, café, pizzeria, and funky retail grocery" La Grande Orange was one of the first places I visited on my seminal trip to Phoenix and the place I first suggested to my mother after driving cross country to pick up gifts for my sister and aunt back home. Sort of like The Cracker Barrel (for mainstream reference - I apologize to those I may have offended) or Southport Grocery and Café (more appropriately) in scope with a small store and bakery up front and a full-fledged kitchen/restaurant in back I'd originally planned to write my standard review of LGO and all of the things I've purchased, eaten, and loved but eventually decided that such a mission would be shortsighted and considering the fact that I now own a home in Phoenix also rather futile - unless they close/burn down or I move/die this list will simply grown and grow.  Instead what I will do from here on out is seasonal updates with salient notes and pictures; from the black and white garden gnome salt&pepper shakers, toad banks and elk-horn knives to the baked goods, pancakes, and pizzas I love this place.\u000a\u000aEthiopian Reserve Coffee/Decaf/Black and Tan from ROC2:  I'd be lying if I didn't admit that at least half the reason I spend so much time at LGO is related to the free Wi-Fi and copious refills of coffee from The Roastery of Cave Creek.  Owned and operated by Dave Anderson and Michael Smith with operations not far from my home I've been lucky enough to enjoy some of their single origins from Central America, but for a blend the two offered up at LGO are both excellent with brighter citrus notes accenting the Ethiopian and lower cocoa and earthen notes in the Black and Tan.  Beats wildflower or paradise any day of the week in the battle for best freely refillable coffee.\u000a\u000aCroque Madame with Whole Wheat, Tomato, Egg, Ham, Gruyere:  I don't like Dijon and as such I requested the Croque without and what I received was superlative as the savory ham and aged gruyere were briny and bold yet tamed admirably by the crusty bread and sweet, bright tomatoes.  Topped off with a runny egg, sea salt, and just a touch of cracked pepper this wasn't quite a traditional croque but it was delicious...though the accoutrements of sour pickles and sweet melon didn't really 'fit.'\u000a\u000aFamous French Pancakes with honey, strawberries, and crème fraiche:  My grandmother was Hungarian and as I remember it she was also a very good cook, a talent my mother unfortunately did not inherit save for a couple of dishes; one of these dishes was Hungarian palacsinta or sweet pancakes.  Sort of like a French crepe but with a bit more tooth LGO's "French Pancakes" reminded me much more of palacsinta than crepe and while others may think this a bad thing I thought it was sublime.  When mom comes back to visit this is on the short list of 'must tries.'\u000a\u000aBlueberry Muffin with Whole Wheat Streusel:  Admitting my sweet tooth and wearing it on my sleeve, the first of many pastries sampled at LGO (aside from the Red Velvet Cupcake during my recruitment trip) was this, a killer whole wheat muffin topped with buttery cinnamon streusel and literally bursting with fresh blueberries.  Clearly seasonal with their focus on using fresh, never frozen ingredients I was stunned by the quality of the berries as summer had recently come to a close but hefty in butter and berries while light and fluffy on the bite this was a great muffin.\u000a\u000aPumpkin Spice Muffin:  A second muffin, this one just before Halloween, was even better than the first in terms of composition - and with a surprise burst of tangy cream cheese filling on the inside a contender for best pumpkin novelty I've had in recent memory.  Big and bold with the flavors of pumpkin, cinnamon, and nutmeg all perfuming the palate and moist like pumpkin pie without being wet I particularly loved the salty toasted pumpkin seeds topping off the muffin - a savory touch that worked nicely with the sweet filling.\u000a\u000a...more to come

VEnglish Muffin with Blackberry Preserves: Not technically a muffin like those above, but perhaps LGO's most famous muffin (can be shipped worldwide by the dozen) this moist and doughy take on the classic is probably pretty good from your home toaster, but what makes it worth the $2 on site is the treatment - butter lacquered and cooked on the stovetop providing the outside a crisp bite that gives way to the pillow within.  A bag of these and a jar of local honey, preserves, or pretty much any topping sold at LGO Grocery would make for a lovely start to Sunday breakfast at home.\u000a\u000aBlackberry Almond Dumpling:  If this is available at LGO you should do yourself a favor and buy two.  Powder sugar dusted and crispy like a croissant on its exterior with a wispy pull-apart interior somewhere between the aforementioned croissant and a cinnamon roll this 'dumpling' was rife with frangipane and fresh blackberries, but more so with butter.  Served warm and well-endowed to make a substantial mess of clothing both black and white I would recommend this one only as a fork and knife pastry, though any mess you make will be worth it.\u000a\u000aPistachio Chocolate Cream Puff:  A cream puff per LGO but a dressed up Paris Brest to me this wheel of choux was perhaps not as texturally sound or traditional as some of the hazelnut versions of France and elsewhere but with crackling pastry topped with a cocoa shell and crunchy pistachios plus an interior of pistachio tinged pastry cream it would be hard to be disappointed by this one.  Every bit as unique as Dominique Ansel's Paris/NY but not quite as decadent I personally loved the sweet meets savory aspects of this one but would definitely go early as the shell was starting to get a bit moist by the time I enjoyed this around noon.\u000a\u000aCrème Fraiche Coffee Cake:  I'll totally admit to being a sucker for coffee cake, and even more for butter cake - but prior to entering La Grande Orange that Saturday morning I had no idea there was crème fraiche cake.  With the traditional style obviously focused on sour cream, or in the rare case cream cheese, this take would up the ante in the savories department and with sours nicely balanced by cinnamon and what I swear was cardamom and maybe even rosemary I could have eaten a whole loaf of this if LGO had provided me jam.  With a fine crumb and delicately sweet this went great with coffee but I could see it equally well suited alongside afternoon tea and sandwiches or cheese.\u000a\u000aOld Timer Cupcake:  Having already enjoyed the Red Velvet cupcake on a prior visit (as well as the Red Velvet Cake from LGO at Chelsea's Kitchen earlier that day) I decided to try the Old Timer on my most recent visit to LGO and while I'm not sure if you can call it a cupcake since it is covered top to bottom with a crunchy dark chocolate shell and therefore more like a Ding Dong (or King Don for you Midwesterners) it is still quite delicious as the dark chocolate shell, airy chocolate angel food cake, and light cream all come together much like the classic Hostess version, but with a bit less of the artificial sweetness.  Great with a cup of coffee there is really nothing 'special' here, just a really good piece of chocolate cake that goes nicely with a cup of coffee (or a big glass of milk.)\u000a\u000aAtoZ Cookie and French Sea Salt Chocolate Chip Cookie:  Two more things that go great with milk or coffee, these half pound cookies are without a doubt amongst the best I've ever tasted.  Two choices amongst a daily half-dozen or so each of these decadent creations sets a high standard for texture with the outer rim slightly crisp while the interior falls just short of 'set' but where they truly excel are the ingredients - the former a sort of kitchen sink concoction of corn flakes, caramel, oats, toffee, and who knows what else while the second is simply a perfect dark chocolate chunk cookie heavily garnished with a hefty shake of fresh flaked fleur de sel.  Go early when they're warm - and before they sell out.\u000a\u000aCampfire Smores Brownie:  In a word, decadent and in another, intense; for the chocolate lover this is an absolute must (but even then it is probably best shared.)  Dense, moist, and rife with dark chocolate while house made marshmallows and graham crackers attempt to add some levity this certainly isn't an everyday treat but as a capper to a an LGO pizza it worked quite nicely.

VItems selected included:\u000aBlueberry Cake\u000aButtermilk Cake\u000aStrawberry Raised\u000aApple Fritter\u000aChocolate Oreo\u000aMaple Bacon\u000a\u000aFor their last day in Phoenix I took my mother and aunt to La Grande Orange - easily my favorite spot in The Valley - but being late risers I decided to grab some donuts beforehand just down the street at Rainbow Donuts, an independent branch of the local chain that many claim to make the best donuts in the area.  Opening early - I believe 4am - and at least by 5:15am when I arrived on 12/31 the shop is small and anything but trendy, the only other patrons during my visit a trio of old veterans who apparently meet there daily, but with a friendly staff and an interesting selection of classics and novel options alike I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.\u000a\u000aSelecting a half dozen donuts and taking portions of each home it likely comes as no surprise that the warm cake donuts were my favorite - the buttermilk bar literally still dripping glaze - and with the blueberry subtle and light plus the fritter less greasy than the average with a great crunch giving way to cinnamon apples within I enjoyed all three more than those that were raised - the dough a bit less wispy or raised than I prefer and the frosting on both the maple and the strawberry a bit too artificial, though the Oreo option was admittedly quite good as the frosting approximated the flavor of Nestle Quick.

VPleasant staff, no real wait time, and conveniently located close to home.  While I fully admit to being high maintenance in some ways I keep my hair a relatively simple process - just follow what is there, keep it even, and charge me less than $20 because whatever is left from President Jackson is your tip.  One star off for forcing me to listen to pop music for 20 minutes, but otherwise not too shabby at all.

VA nice Whole Foods, to be sure, but considering the Fry's right down the street has great produce at better prices I'm not really sure what would send me to Whole Foods aside from perhaps a search for something esoteric.  Not really much different from the Whole Foods back home in Ohio I'll still be here anytime I need bulk fleur de sel or perhaps quality coffee in a pinch, but otherwise I just can't justify the admission price.

VFull review in the blog, simply not enough room to express my praises here:\u000a\u000a...how do you begin to describe a meal at Kai - the only Forbes 5-Diamond restaurant in Arizona and perhaps the only "fine dining exploration of Native American Culture" in the world?  Would it be easiest to discuss it as a "resort restaurant" where the meal is begun with an offering of citrus selections for the water and silverware is presented temperature appropriate?  Would it make sense to talk about the culinary pedigree of head Chef Michael O'Dowd and his heavy reliance on refined French technique to display the beauty of rarely utilized locally farmed ingredients?  Or perhaps I should start off in the manner that a meal at Kai begins - with a lengthy and informative story about the location, tribe, and inspirations of the meal that will follow.  In reality I think any of the above would be appropriate, but in the end I think the best way to begin is in the mindset of a "destination" meal because from start to finish that is precisely what Kai is.\u000a\u000aThe second course of my meal at Kai would prove to be the single best thing I ate during my visit to the desert - a plate where nearly everything screamed "heavy and overly complicated" but a dish where each element added something to the whole with the resultant product even greater than the sum of its parts.  Entitled "Escargot, Truffles, Wild Mushrooms & Caramel Goat Cheese" this lovely presentation arrived with a piece of slightly sweetened Native "French Toast" at one end and a stew of Burgundy snails, Oregon truffles, and pork belly nuggets at the other.  Teaming with notes of Meyer lemon and black garlic nage plus the sweet acidity of blis vinegar the dish was finally topped tableside with a slowly melting frozen Truffle Crema and dots of Tarragon Oil and Chive Oil that added an aromatic tinge both earthy and herbal that rose to the palate and sinuses melding all the flavors into a truly magnificent dish.\u000a\u000aAnother highlight reel dish and served at the size of its full a la carte portion the "Prairie Squab & Spiced Cornmeal Dusted Sweetbreads" would be quite the generous offering.  Beginning first with the scarlet squab featuring a flawless sear and the hockey-puck sized sweetbread, crispy on the outside and creamy within, both of the proteins on this plate would prove exemplary.  Moving next to the accoutrements - beneath the squab a round of truffled Iberico Lomo Gratinee Potatoes plus Wilted Summer Chard Leaves and under the thymus a dollop of stone fruit & grape Chutney with Truffle Croutons -one sweet and one savory once again, and both complimentary to their respective proteins without being overwhelming.\u000a\u000amMy final dessert would arrive in the hands of a back-server along with a warning of "be careful, this is very hot" and indeed it was, the Mexican Chocolate Souffle's ramekin radiating a palpable heat at easily a two foot distance.  Large, tall, proper, and aromatic with notes of cocoa and "Kai's Sweetened Dry Mole Spices" the soufflé was subsequently punctured tableside with the addition of a thick and smoky Wattleseed Anglaise and without hesitation I can say that although non-traditional in texture the flavor was outstanding...a sweet meets savory brownie with notes of cinnamon, cumin, pepper, and clove punctuating the chocolate and melding with the Anglaise.  Like the cheesecake this is the sort of dessert I imagined when I requested its addition to my menu and I'd encourage any and all to do the same.\u000a\u000aNo stranger to fine dining whether stateside or in Paris I will simply state that although some may not appreciate "resort" restaurants or the somewhat longwinded ostentatiousness of Kai's presentations there is not a doubt in my mind that this is a restaurant deserving of its 5-star accolades and the sort of restaurant that would invariably garner at least two if not three Michelin Stars if the Red Guide ever came to town.  A refined experience with an exquisitely talented chef preparing ingredients both common and unique in ways that are novel even to the experience diner Kai is not just a restaurant, but truly the exploration of native and local flavors that it sets out to be.

VAnother long day - clinic all morning, lunch at Barrio Café, and a late dinner at Kai - yet the morning routine would repeat itself again with a great twelve mile run around Kierland making me wish every hour of every day was like Phoenix before dawn.  Showered and refreshed by the in-room Starbucks Africa Kitamu and readied for another long day of eating, sightseeing, eating, hockey, and eating I made my way to the car and set my GPS for the town of Gilbert; destination Liberty Market, home of what many (including the local paper) have noted to be the best Bread Pudding around.\u000a\u000aA functioning grocery since 1935 and located in a building under a water tower every bit showing its age I approached Liberty Market slowly due to the local farmer's market - a market containing much of what has now been out of season in Ohio for at least a month - and with parking readily available I made my way into Liberty Market via the side door.  Passing the al fresco dining area, the kitchen, and subsequently the store and pastry counter to take my place in a line six deep I grabbed a paper menu on the way in to browse though in all reality it was not really necessary; I knew what I was there for and the pastry case had already tempted me with any number of appetizers.  \u000a\u000aStanding in line while others made their decisions, some a full meal and some merely pastries to go, when I eventually reached the coffee bar I was greeted by a young man with spacers and sleeves to fit his blasé demeanor and placing my order the price was recited and a number was handed to me with any number of seats to choose from both inside and out.  Opting this time for the indoors and filling a glass with water and ice I took a seat with a full view of the room and placing my number on the table was left to wait for perhaps 10 minutes while reading a local guidebook detailing Liberty's history as well as  the other restaurants in Joe Johnston's stable.\u000a\u000aSipping my water while watching a small boy barely make a dent in his enormous pile of eggs my first course of the meal at Liberty would arrive hot from the pastry case in the form of the largest Cinnamon Roll I've eaten to date - a squared off yeasty pastry nearly filling the 12" by 12"plate and inundating what I can only imagine to be a 6 foot diameter with the smells of butter, cinnamon, and sugar.  Large yet impressively light with wispy dough sandwiching layers of cinnamon and butter and the entirely lacquered in a thin sugar shell the Cinnamon Roll wowed in flavor as much as it did in size and without being the belly buster of Cinnabon was a perfect size to share as an appetizer - or, if you're feeling truly ravenous (gluttonous) to enjoy on your own.\u000a\u000aWith the cinnamon roll easily dispatched of and now wishing I'd have gotten coffee but not wanting to withstand the 10+ deep line my second dish would arrive approximately fifteen minutes on the heels of the cinnamon roll and given all its hype I truly expected the Griddled Bread Pudding to be mind blowing, but alas it was merely very good.  Served with real maple syrup and approximately half the size and twice the weight of the cinnamon roll the bread pudding was in reality nearly flawless French Toast - a caramelized exterior and a moist custard interior, but what he had in texture it unfortunately lacked in taste.  Largely eggy but also with slight notes of cinnamon and vanilla that perked up with the syrup perhaps part of my disillusionment with the pudding was actually how sweet its predecessor had been but overall it just felt like something was missing - perhaps some fruit, whipped cream, or caramelized nuts to add a bit of texture and nuance (this is apparently how they serve the dessert, non-griddled, bread pudding.)\u000a\u000aOverall a very nice spot and a place I'd definitely return to for the baked goods as well as to try the pancakes, plus perhaps the griddled bread pudding with a side of fruit as a starter and one of those incredible looking Sticky Buns or scones as dessert.

VThis place is certainly geared toward kids.\u000aI don't have kids.\u000aI don't particularly like kids.\u000aI really do like this park, though.\u000a\u000aFrom the large retired train engines down to the scale models much of the park is free and the things that they do charge for aren't terribly expensive ($2-4 each.)  \u000a\u000aIf you have kids this place is a must.  If you don't have kids but you happen to be in the area do check it out.

VIt is another strip mall - and a very subpar one at that.  No covered parking.  No real stores of interest.  Too crowded, and a royal pain in the ass to take a left turn out of given the light timing.

VDear Furniture Sales People,\u000a\u000aOnce you introduce yourself and give me your card we're cool - if I have questions I'll ask.  Contrary to what you may believe, "I'm just browsing" means I'm just browsing - it does NOT mean I need you to hover 10 feet away making idle suggestions about all the nice stuff you have that I clearly just walked past.  I'm sure it is nice - for someone else - and I don't care that you have more in storage.  If I wanted to know if you had more in storage (especially the 6th time you mentioned it) I'd ASK.\u000a\u000aI guess I just expected more for the price - more selection, more quality, and...okay, well, a whole lot LESS sales pressure.\u000a\u000aI left and bought a couch at Arizona Leather instead.

VAfter less than stellar experiences at La Maison and Ladlow's I turned to head home, but seeing the sign for Arizona Leather I decided to stop in.  Little did I know I'd be the proud owner of a couch that should theoretically last me a lifetime little more than an hour later.  Never a fan of 'high pressure' commission salespersons I could not have been happier than I was working with Caryle to pick out an ideal couch for my new home and with everything in the store made here in the US with 100% whole grain leather I know what I'm getting is quality.  Made and stitched to order with a choice of 6 leather types and a great sale ongoing I admittedly spent more than I'd originally expected, but with a lifetime warranty and 25 years in the business I consider this one an investment in myself.  The difficulty now will be buying cheaper chairs and/or accents when I own such a stellar centerpiece to my new living space.  \u000a\u000aHighly recommended.

VNot gonna lie, I don't stay at nice hotels very often - as a matter of fact, if I do it is because someone else is paying and as was the situation at The Westin Kierland; perhaps the most lux resort I've ever had the opportunity to visit.\u000a\u000aFrom the top notch linens to the concierge who pretty much thinks of everything, from the immaculate grounds to the gym better than the sort you pay for at home the place certainly has it all, but at a price - and then another $25/day "resort fee" tacked on for good measure.\u000a\u000aDon't get me wrong, I like the luxury - but I don't need it - and if you're going to charge me on the front end then please don't nickle and dime me later.

VA touch more picked over than some of the Racks I've been to, but with a far more spring/summer slant befitting the Arizona climate.  Picked up a new briefcase for 75% off, a new pair of running shoes for 66% off, a few shirts, and was sorely tempted by a few ties and a number of cufflinks.\u000a\u000aParticularly helpful considering the movers have not yet delivered my belongings from Ohio, but no doubt I'll be back frequently as I begin adjusting my wardrobe to life in the valley.

VItems selected include:  \u000a\u000aDeep Fried Tofu Mussel Cake with corn and carrots\u000aPudding - Tofu Crème Caramel\u000aHoney Toast with Ice Cream\u000aFried Quail Egg\u000aMushroom Chawanmushi\u000a\u000a...my first day in Vegas always goes later than anticipated, but not for the same reason as others since it is usually a late night reservation at one of the restaurant's top tier restaurants that keeps me out late and true to form we could not get a seat at Kabuto until 9:00pm thus allowing plenty of time for small plates and sake beforehand at Ichiza, just across the street on Spring Mountain.  A venerable establishment amongst both tourists and locals long before Raku put LV's Chinatown on everybody's 'must visit' list I'd wanted to visit Ichiza during my past two visits to Sin City but both due to location and the rest of the city's eats it had always fallen on the 'next time' list until we literally found ourselves in the area with nothing else to do.\u000a\u000aSmall and tucked away on the second floor of a non-descript strip mall with a podium for check-in leading to a largely open floor plan with kitchen at center, seating at tables and bars (on chairs or on tatami style mats,) and menus hanging on walls all around Ichiza looks like chaos when you first enter and with seating tight the process of placing an order literally consists of walking around the room to figure out what you want as the chefs work quietly and vigorously churning out plate after plate.  With my pal conserving appetite and focusing on sake while I perused the options it would not be long before we placed our order - sitting, sipping cold sake, and taking in the scene.  \u000a\u000aBeginning first with the savories, though food didn't necessarily arrive in that order, a trio of options presented two excellent fried options, the quail eggs still jiggly on the inside with a golden exterior crunch and the mussel cake surprisingly vegetal and creamy thanks to the house made tofu and fresh corn.  Less successful, the smooth egg custard was spot on in texture but with the mushrooms only resting atop the chawanmushi the base was largely flavorless aside from salt and onion - even when mixed the only part really worth eating being the bits directly exposed to the fungus.  \u000a\u000aMoving on to sweets my selection of the tofu pudding was at our server's behest and unlike the chawanmushi this creamy custard was lovely, the silky texture somewhere between a true flan and something more dense like cheesecake, and as to the Honey Toast - it is enormous, it is delicious, and with the block of bread hollowed out and toasted to just short of crisp before being slathered in warm honey and topped off with a ball of ice cream it is best shared - particularly if you have dinner or drinking plans for later.

VItems selected:  Bavarian, Blueberry Cake, Blueberry Fritter, Sourcream, Buttermilk Bar, Raised Glazed, Reverse Cinnamon Roll, Chocolate Cake, Crumb Cake, Apple Fritter\u000a\u000aHaving arranged various "foodcrawls" in the past it was with admitted enthusiasm that I entered Real Donuts to gather provisions for Las Vegas' first (known) donut crawl and with several glistening varieties fresh from the fryer only two challenges arose, the first limiting my order to a dozen and the second delivering the fried dough to the party without sneaking a bite.  A small, clean shop with excellent service and a dozen donuts only $10 after tax and a tip it was up against three other doughnutteries that Real would find itself matched and although the occasional contender from Sunrise Too, Master Donuts, or Donut Hut shined it was Real Donuts that proved most consistent across the board.  Featuring crispy fritters rife with fruit and low in oil, a textbook old-fashioned sourcream that literally melts on the tongue, and both yeasted and cake options on par with the city's best it would truly be hard to name a bad one in the bunch - a task I'll simply discard and suggest futile as I think back on the Blueberry Fritter, a 95 cent daily special I'd suggest worthy of 'destination' status.

Small and humble, a true 'old-world' donut shop with bad coffee and all the classics but none of the fuss, it was no real surprise that on my arrival a typical scene appeared; old men shooting the breeze, smiling clerks occasionally weighing in, and a slow but constant trickle of patrons gathering pink boxes of still-warm pastries to go - mine containing a hefty half dozen.  Modest in my expectations even amidst the historical praise my tasting of Ronald's work began with a tangy and delicate buttermilk bar and progressing through options both yeasted and cake including an impressive tiger tail and seemingly half pound bear claw chalk-a-block full of apples it was not until I reached the greasy and overly processed tasting 'apple burrito' that Ronald's would stumble, a theme also notable in the sizable but otherwise underwhelming apple fritter - an item made far better at Friendly, Coco, and Pinkbox.

VItems selected:\u000a\u000aCoffee\u000a\u000aChocolate Oreo Pancakes - Four pancakes cooked with our 40 year old special recipe chocolate buttermilk pancake batter with gobs of real crumbled Oreo cookies cooked right in the batter, then topped with our homemade vanilla icing. Finished with more crumbled Oreo cookies sprinkled on top of the pancakes\u000a\u000aBlueberry Hill Style Monte Cristo Sandwich - Turkey and ham smothered with Swiss cheese, grilled on our own French toast bread with Strawberry Compote\u000a\u000aRed Velvet Cake\u000a\u000aContrary to the opinions of some, as much as I enjoy fine dining I share equal passion for dining experiences many gourmands would consider 'low brow,' particularly at breakfast, and taking this fact into account it was with much enthusiasm that I finally visited locally grown 24/7 staple Blueberry Hill just prior to 6am Saturday morning.  Situated on Decatur and the largest of a handful of locations spanning the city the look and feel of the restaurant can best be summed up as an upscaled Denny's with better coffee alongside a more creative menu and given my early hour of arrival the service was exemplary - an older couple entering just after me the restaurant's only other patrons.  A skeleton crew in the kitchen largely focused on preparing the day's housemade cakes and pastries it was with little delay that decisions were made from the extensive menu and orders placed I chatted with my waitress at length, the longtime veteran of Blueberry Hill keeping coffee filled to the brim and commending my picks while offering suggestions for 'next time' - an occurrence that will be sooner rather than later given the quality of what soon arrived.  Beginning savory and moving to sweet it was with a loaded un-fried Monte Cristo that I began and deferring standard jam with a request for the housemade strawberry compote I'd strongly recommend everyone do the same as the ample sweetness proved a lovely balance to briny ham and smoked turkey..."balance" completely ignored by my second selection, the pillow soft pancakes chock-a-block full of crushed cookies and smeared with frosting identical in flavor to the cream-filling, plus whipped cream for garnish.  Sated and heavily caffeinated it was perhaps a bit gluttonous to consider dessert but unable to pass on a rotating cake-case it was with a slice of Red Velvet that I made my departure and waiting until the afternoon to indulge the results were good, if not great, as the cake was moist and rich though I'd have preferred more tang to the icing...a small quibble at $3 for the 11.6oz 'slice.'

VI simply can't wait to go back to Vegas to visit this place.....er, wait, that is another review.\u000a\u000aOn the contrary, being an early morning kinda guy and not wanting to disturb my roommate I decided to go for a morning run and ended up going to this 7-Eleven around 5:45am.  The coffee was luke-warm and they were out of splenda......okay, fine, so I bought a diet Mountain Dew.  \u000a\u000aOn the way out I was asked, by a bum, whether I liked cars.  Wanting to be nice I said "as much as I can."  Apparently unsatisfied with this answer the bum began to follow me, screaming obscenities about the Ford Mustang.  This continued until I decided to duck into the Wynn.....in my gym clothes, dirty shoes, sweating, at 6:00am.  \u000a\u000aThis year, less 7-Eleven, more Wynn.

VItems Selected:\u000aCoffee\u000aCinnamon Roll French Toast\u000aFrench Toast Breakfast Sandwich - Scrambled Eggs, Bacon, Cheddar, Biscuit, Maple Syrup, Jelly, Honey\u000aButter Pecan Bread Pudding\u000aCarrot Cake\u000a\u000aLocated in the lobby of The Stratosphere and operating 24/7 since its inception Roxy's Diner had always struck me as the sort of restaurant targeting the hotel's drunken late nights but with a recent menu update and a fresh coat of paint I suddenly found the place calling my name, a 6:00am breakfast proving well worth the trek.  Large in size and copious in choices from the 'all-day' menu as Marilyn Monroe films and 50s décor flourish beneath an era appropriate soundtrack it was to smiling service that my arrival was met and although coffee refills occasionally required reminder nothing about kitschy cuisine lacked in the least.  Beginning first with a duo of French Toasts, one part savory and one thoroughly sweet, suffice it to say that when compared to central-strip 24/7s like Central or Carnegie Roxy's portions trend large for the price and although the sandwich was quite good with crispy bacon and fluffy eggs between supple bread it paled in comparison to the cinnamon roll's gluttonous spiral complete with frosting and further gilded with a warm maple sidecar.  Setting aside parts of the first course "to-go" (a ridiculous $1 surcharge for the box on my bill) and turning attention to desserts it was to another duo that I was treated and although I'm rather certain the bread pudding suffered a delay en route given the lukewarm temperature and melted ice cream the flavors were quite pleasant, a compliment equally offered to a sizable $6 carrot cake rife with cinnamon and thickly frosted with citrus-tinged cream cheese.

VItems selected:  Raised Twist, Bavarian, Buttermilk Bar, Apple Fritter, Raised Crumb, Maple Long John, Chocolate Sour Cream\u000a\u000aNot personally visited but part of the first official Las Vegas Donut Crawl, Sunrise Too would prove to be the mixed bag of the group, a series of valleys and peaks mirroring the local landscape and defined by my two favorite fried treats, the Apple Fritter and the Buttermilk Bar.  Beginning first with the fritter it can only be said that this was perhaps the worst I've ever found - the texture not only far too oily but nearly inedible with grease I'd classify near-rancid...the sort of thing that could turn a stomach on the pastry forever and such a far cry from the rest of the selections that I wonder if we were peddled a leftover, particularly as the yeasted options were actually quite light; the rise excellent and the texture soft but not 'chewy' - a fact highlighted by the juxtaposition of the crumbled cinnamon on the crumb option.  Amongst other disappointments I personally found Sunrise's Bavarian cloyingly sweet and decidedly artificial tasting compared to both Real and Donut Hut, but again finding redemption it was Sunrise's Buttermilk Bar that proved my favorite item of the tasting, the archetype version loaded with tangy notes beneath sweet glaze and an ethereal texture with obvious visual separation of the cake layer and buttermilk layer on hemisection, a sort of fried coffee cake that makes me want to go back for more of their cake selections...no matter how bad the fritter.

VTwice thwarted in my prior attempts to experience Luv It, once as a result of arriving two-hours prior to the 1pm opening hour and once due to staff vacation, the third time would finally prove a charm in visiting what a friend and former pastry chef deems "the best frozen custard in the country" - a sentiment ironically echoed by former and current mayors, Oscar and Carolyn Goodman, who arrived moments after me and spoke fondly of myriad visits to Greg Tiedemann's stand over the years as we waited in line.  Generally underwhelmed by custards as compared to artisan ice creams or gelatos in the past I'd hardly realized that the small window had such an extensive menu of flavors until I approached, but with standards of chocolate and vanilla plus seasonal cheesecake, cherry pie, blue moon, and countless toppings, sauces, and mix-ins I was glad to have some time to think - eventually settling on a $4.25 cash-only "Butter Crunch" over vanilla custard plus a large spooned sample of cherry pie.  Traditional in texture, full bodied with flavor, unmistakably custard given a light egginess to the vanilla, and with substantially more heft than the versions popularized at iconic Ted Drewes' or franchised Rita's it took a few rich spoonfuls to truly appreciate the velvety texture of the custard itself as I worked through toppings acting more as a distraction than a compliment but once down to creamy base it can only be said that this is indeed some excellent custard and for fans of the style it is a 'must visit,' though for my dining dollars the presence of Art of Flavors only a few blocks away will make a return unlikely anytime soon as even the "best" custard can't hold a candle to truly superlative gelato.

VTo talk with friends in New York, Philadelphia, or San Francisco they'd lead you to believe that Las Vegas has no culture - an obvious lie to anyone who has seen a show, attended a play, or visited some of the new galleries at places like City Center, Emergency Arts, or The Arts Factory.  Sure there are obvious differences between the cultures of this city and that of old classics like those listed above, but with variety the spice of life I'd almost argue that Vegas is every bit on par with all but perhaps New York in terms of diversity and 24/7 'things to do.'  All in all a great place with a decent enough collection of art the average person can potentially afford, plus a decent restaurant in Bar + Bistro and a number of clever local shops I've now been here thrice and walked away with something each and every time - from a pig magnet made from a cola can to a piece of fine art, plus some really excellent French Toast.

VGhetto, smoky, and just a bit scary I cannot think of a single reason to visit the Eureka aside from Fat Choy and thus, doing a bit of math, if the casino itself is a 1 star experience while the restaurant is an easy 5 star visit given the bang-for-the-buck I guess I'll round it off to a three.\u000a\u000aAvoid the restrooms, get your duck bao and a nutella roti, and get out before you get emphysema.

VI'm not one of those sunglasses junkies and as a matter of fact I've been wearing the same Costa Del Mar Polarized lenses since 2003, but when the recent blistering Phoenix heat finally ruined what was a long and happy relationship I found myself looking for something new and The Vault definitely filled a need with great sale items, friendly customer service, and a nearly overwhelming selection.\u000a\u000aHaving not owned a pair of Oakleys since high school...1998 for those keeping score (yes, I'm old)...I'm impressed by how the quality of the product has changed over the years while prices remain similar and the styles continue to evolve.

VConveniently located and always friendly, though a tad difficult to find for those not familiar with the pavilion.  Stamps, UPS, and plenty of packaging material - pretty much par for the course in this sort of spot but served with a smile that is quite uncommon.  Small and never with a line, even during lunch, this UPS store has kept me from the USPS for nearly 4 months and for that I can smile.

Clearly a menu designed with wine in mind but not particularly wanting to imbibe so early in the day it was instead the food that brought me to Bacchus, specifically the house charcuterie program and as such selecting the Bacchus platter along with an order of the house foie gras would be the order of the day, a lovely arrangement that paired beautifully with not only the warm house bread but also the weather, sun, water, ducks and turtles passing by.  From appropriately funky rillettes to spicy chorizo and a hearty pork pate each item on the charcuterie platter was excellent while the foie gras itself was delicate and creamy with all its characteristic sapor despite the surprisingly flavorless and liquidy gelee - a situation remedied quickly with a request for more quince.  Moving on to dessert, and actually a difficult choice amongst a pair of my favorites I eventually went with my instincts and selected the bread pudding, a delicate cloud that seemed to be made of angel food cake with ample house whipped cream and a sidecar of intense rum sauce spiked with cinnamon.  A lovely space that feels a million miles from the Strip I have no doubt I'll be seeing more of Marche Bacchus in my future, particularly given their frequent special events.

VAfter receiving a price quote of $35 for a quarter inch strip of leather on a pair of Prada double monk strap loafers from the abhorrent "Shoe Lab" in Boca Park I turned to Mike's - a simple fix rendered in 48-hours for a mere $6 that is completely indistinguishable from the original loop located just two inches to its right.  Perfect leather grain match, seemless stitching, and friendly service with no fuss.

Starting at the door where hasty greetings lead us to the back room it would be less that thirty seconds after seating that the blitzkrieg began - baskets and steamers that had clearly been propped against the wall shoved in our faces with several selections requiring an unannounced trip to the kitchen microwave - and kicking off with a trio of steamed options it was only BBQ Pork buns that proved competent as rubbery XLB and Shu Mai skins undermined otherwise juicy contents.  Still frenetic in pace as a $16 lobster special with slippery noodles swimming in ginger found its way to the table alongside a trio of excellent baked pastries it would unfortunately not be long before these gems were lost amidst overly salted garlic smelt and a dry coconut sponge, the duo immediately leaving me parched  as beverage refills lagged.  Admittedly underwhelmed at this point but willing to go one more round it was at long last (actually only 40 minutes) that Cathay House would rally with a strong finish from a duo of kitchen fresh carts - the crispy duck, sticky pork ribs, and supple shrimp balls all piping hot and reference standard leaving me to wonder what could have been had everything else been delivered fresh.

VWithout a doubt the cleanest and best stocked Wal-Mart in the area; and for the most part the one with the least vagrants outside asking for money.

VApproaching the hostess stand as I looked around the newly designed space I was quick to find that much like my surroundings the service too at Lo Lo's was far superior to Roscoe's and led by one smiling face at the podium to another at my table towards the back it would not be long before a menu was in hand, water was filled, and a few daily specials were noted - the whole process taking less than five minutes and my order placed within ten, much to my waiter's delight as he noted "man, you ordered all the best stuff - I hope you brought your appetite."\u000a\u000aSitting and watching the games as the restaurant's hustle and bustle continued my neighbors struck up a conversation with me stating that they had been coming to Lo-Lo's "every few weeks since the day it opened" and admitting it was my first time they suggested it definitely wouldn't be my last and within moments of the arrival of my meal I knew they were right as every single item that landed on my table looked excellent; the first being a single $3.50 "Aunt Hattie's Salmon Croquette" featuring a crispy external batter surrounding flaky salmon and studded with green onions.  Apparently a traditional southern recipe but one I'd not previously encountered I was told that these were best with a splash of Lo-Lo's "famous" hot sauce and although I generally prefer to avoid condiments I must say my neighbors were right as the acidity of the sauce really helped to bring out some of the more briny notes from the salmon while breading remained crunchy with minimal grease.\u000a\u000aMoving next to my main plate, the $14 Soulfood Platter with Chicken Fried Chicken, a golden waffle, macaroni and cheese, plus a round of cornbread it would be hard to find a gripe with this dish save for, maybe, those who like their mac n' cheese a little over-baked and with a bit of crunch.  Featuing a double dipped and friend boneless, skinless breast alongside a bowl of intense and peppery sausage gravy the chicken here was definitely the star of the show with each bite juicy and full of crunch but largely devoid of any oil whatsoever.  Nicely spiced and with the gravy further gilding the lily I next turned my attention to the waffle, also crisp but intensely buttery with a good amount of 'give' at the center and while pure maple syrup would have been ideal in the end the Mrs. Butterworth's was fine - the sweetness tempered by the chicken, gravy, and macaroni.  Last but not least, the cornbread crowned with a mound of butter was textbook - a little dry, not too sweet, and good both on its own or as a transition between the plate's other components.\u000a\u000aMaking short work of the Soulfood plate my primary server, Joseph, stopped by to say "nice job" and asking if I had room for dessert I think he was surprised when I said yes - and even more surprised when I ordered two; one for here, one to go, and both eliciting a slow whistle from the gentleman to my left who said to his wife "that boy can eat" - and much like the savories what I ate next would be outstanding.\u000a\u000aBeginning first with the lesser known of Lo-Lo's signature desserts, a house made banana puddin' served in a hefty mason jar and topped with an airy dollop of whipped cream - at $5 this is probably the steal of the menu as the container must have contained twenty spoonful of the rich parfait.  At times rife with the fructose of banana and at times mellowed by whipped cream or saturated Nilla wafers with plenty of textural nuance added by crumbles and chunks of unsoaked cookie this was precisely my kind of dessert; high end ingredients or not, I love pudding.\u000a\u000aRealizing I couldn't (or a least shouldn't) leave Lo-Lo's without trying their oft raved "Sandy Sand's Red Velvet Cake" and knowing I could (but shouldn't) have eaten it while I was still seated at 10 Yuma Street I asked for a piece to be boxed up and although it wasn't pretty, the results were just as good as many have suggested - the cake moist, dense, and loaded with cocoa while the cream cheese icing is slick but not too sweet and nicely tempered by the pecans.  Generally one to fancy cupcakes over sliced cakes mostly because I prefer there to be more cooked surface area and thus more 'sponge' I was particularly interested to see the open baking window as I left the restaurant where the team was assembling the cakes from large springform pans thus allowing the layers to each have more exposure and thus explaining the excellent texture.  For my money I'd go with the puddin', but this is one damned fine Red Velvet, and in the context of the experience that is Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles either make a great finale to a great meal in an unexpected but excellent setting.

VMoving finally to the last of my supplementary snacks I'll start off by saying I'd read about The Fry Bread House a couple of times when planning my trip to The Valley but it did not make my list of must visit stops until just the day prior during dinner at Kai when I was speaking with head Chef Michael O'Dowd about the lack of Native American restaurants in the area (he explained this to me, but that is for another time) and one of his expeditors suggested I should check out Cecilia Miller's temple of fried dough calling it "about as authentic as it gets around here."\u000a\u000aHailing from the Tohono O'odham Nation and serving up her style of Indian Tacos around the area for nearly twenty years (and now at two locations) I opted to head to the original Fry Bread House West and having followed my GPS from door to door I found the location with ease on a relatively dingy stretch of 7th Avenue and allocating parking with ease I made my way into the unassuming low-lying restaurant where I was greeted by a short line and then by a curt but friendly waitress who took no time in requesting my order and name before handing me a plastic cup to get my water and suggesting it would be perhaps 10 minutes before my food was ready.\u000a\u000aTaking a seat - the table slightly sticky and clearly not wiped down since (at least) the last diners - and browsing the scene while I watched the kitchen work through the small open window I marveled at the flow of the room as patron after patron received his or her food.  With some orders having been phoned in and others being delivered to the tables surrounding mine if I had to guess nearly fifteen Fry Breads were served during my nine minute wait and when I finally heard "Michael" called from the front I stepped up to collect my $12 merely seconds before the next order was served up to "Andre."\u000a\u000aReturning to my seat with prizes in hand my first impression was that I'd over ordered as each disc was easily the size of a Frisbee and two-to-three fold as thick, but picking up my first option, the "Indian Taco with Pinto Beans, Shredded Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce" I was next impressed as to just how light the hand stretched bread was - a wisp of pillowy flat bread crisped on the outside by the oil but light and airy within.  With the ingredients a standard store-bought admixture of traditional taco toppings and a bit of hot sauce to taste this was a good choice to understand what the "Indian Taco" was all about (and perhaps to understand why diabetes and lipid disorders are so prevalent in their population, as well.)\u000a\u000aMoving next to my dessert selection, one of the frequently noted "best dishes" in Phoenix and denoted as an "Award Winning Favorite" on the restaurant menu, the Chocolate and Butter Fry Bread would prove to be every bit the "Fair Food" extravagance I expected with the same airy dough this time served openfaced and drizzled - nay - ladled first with butter and then with melted dark chocolate tinged with what I believe was adobe spice and cinnamon.  Sliced and resting atop both wax paper and napkins to soak up the grease I attacked this fry bread with zeal and without going so far as to call it the most sinful thing I've eaten this year I will simply say this; it was a once-in-a-year sort of treat that was entirely worth the money, calories, and visit but at the same time the sort of thing that simply feels "bad" for you despite the smile on your face as you're eating it.

Featuring clean lines and an upscale design with light music playing overhead along with service far more pleasant than other hip breakfast joints in the neighborhood, in our case from a young man named Andrew,  the restaurant plays all the right notes of similar places in other big cities and one ups the competition with a menu that is familiar but also happy to take some chances.\u000a\u000aBeginning first with beverages and baked goods while our primary plates were readied a wide variety of coffees and espresso drinks were prepared and (in the case of the coffee) refilled copiously while the signature Hot Cocoa was rich and thick - almost a drinking chocolate as much as a cocoa and rich enough that my aunt couldn't finish it on her own.  Speaking to the baked goods, while the banana bread could have stood for a few less minutes in the oven the pumpkin spice muffin was dense and moist, hovering somewhere between pumpkin pie and pudding cake as opposed to a muffin or quick bread.\u000a\u000aMoving on to the plates - in our case two orders of pancakes and one of French Toast - it is difficult to say which dish was the best of the group as all three were excellent, but given my predilection for custard French toast as opposed to more bready versions like that at Orange Table I'd have to lean towards the pancakes, no matter how impressive that whisky sauce was, and with that in mind I'll simply say that unless you are really sensitive to spice the Jalapeno Pecan Cakes are a signature dish worthy of signature status; the cakes toothsome and light with the flavors intense enough to make you sweat but not so hot as to make it unpleasant - particularly when balanced out with the buttery nuts and a side of tender griddled prosciutto.

VSeriously - why are there something like 20 Gilbert Ortega galleries/properties in Old Town Scottsdale?  Okay, perhaps 20 is a slight (gross?) exaggeration, but seriously, how much pseudo-native turquoise and silver jewelry does one need?  \u000a\u000aNice staff, sure, and low pressure unlike many of the touristy boutique "galleries" in the area but until I'm in the market for something depicting buffalo, Indians, or horses I think I'll spend my time elsewhere.

VFull thoughts blogged.\u000a\u000a...to call the concept, website, and descriptors of Cowboy Ciao eclectic would be an understatement to say the least - it is almost so "out there" that I'd considered skipping it entirely until one of my dining companions at Pizzeria Bianco suggested that not only was it worth inclusion on my agenda, but that he'd be glad to meet me for lunch - an offer I gladly accepted.  \u000a\u000aWith somewhat shaky padded wooden chairs at each table and a menu delivered at seating my friend and I sat browsing the interior of Peter Kasperski's 1997 space with some amusement; From Mardi Gras beads strewn across chandeliers to wall paintings befitting a mom n' pop Italian space to the largely western themed exposed brick and stucco apparently little has changed in the intervening 15 years.  Chuckling to myself as I opened the menu with quotations ranging from Spaceballs to The Addams family it would be mere moments before our server, John, would stop by to fill our water and announce the daily specials.  With the afternoon crowd clearly slow and John, a good waiter but a bit more corny than would have been preferred, ever present it would be mere moments before we were ready to order and confirming all our choices as "excellent" we were left to chat\u000a\u000aDiscussing real estate, travel, and the area of Old-town Scottsdale it would be a mere 15 minutes before our first courses would arrive and for my appetizer I selected Duck Confit Relleno with roasted shallots, queso Oaxaca, cheddar, and roasted guajillo-tomatillo salsa, I will fully admit that I ordered this dish largely based on the fowl but what I received turned out to be large, bold, and unexpectedly quite sweet.  Beginning first with the Relleno itself, a cored pasilla chili pepper absolutely stuffed with confit and cheese then fried and coated with even more cheese the flavor was exemplary.  With fresh sliced avocado and the squeaky cheese taming the pepper while the crisp duck nicely juxtaposed the creamy cheddar it was the green salsa that really served as the most surprising part of this dish - an acidic pineapple flavor with a slightly heated finish.\u000a\u000aFor ours second course we'd see Cowboy Ciao's most famous dishes - first the "Stetson Chopped," I had the opportunity to watch the beautifully arranged salad of couscous, arugula, tomato, cheese, pepitas, corn, salmon, and currants come together before my eyes.  Never one to be wowed by a salad, particularly one with a mayo based dressing I will admit that the presentation and composition of this dish did intrigue me enough to take a couple of bites and while indeed a salad I could just as easily make at home I really did love the variety of textures and flavors hiding beneath a dressing that although hefty was quite refreshing with notes of basil, onion, garlic, and lemon beneath the slightly sour creamy tones.\u000a\u000aIf the Stetson is not Cowboy Ciao's most fabled item then my main course most certainly was, a dish described simply as the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry.  Again topped with chopped avocados, cheese, and tomatoes and consisting of "mucho mushrooms (including cremini, button, oyster, cepe, lobster, black trumpet, shiitake, morel, yellow foot)" in ancho cream over double-cooked polenta the pan fry would prove to be many things, not the least of which being the richest vegetarian dish I've ever tasted.  Beginning first with the mushrooms - a blend I have a hard time calling exotic as each can be found at your local Whole Foods - I will admit that the variety of flavors and textures were truly impressive, particularly as they related to the hearty and complex sauce.  With each bite a different experience depending on the balance of mushrooms and vegetables this was exactly the sort of dish I love though I really could have done without the polenta - a thick gob that was so wet it did nothing to soak up any of the sauce and as such tasted like a wet sponge in the middle of the dish.\u000a\u000aHaving requested some bread to assist in sopping up the rest of the ancho cream (bread that is 'baked to order,' largely flavorless on its own, and an unlisted $2 for three meager rolls) John would arrive as my friend was finishing his salad and I was sopping up the last of my sauce to ask if we would be interested in dessert and with my love of bread pudding well documented I selected "Bread Pudding Overboard" which arrived on a large plate in a relatively modest portion. .  Beginning first with buttery brioche - the sort they should have served instead of those dinner rolls - nicely soaked in caramel custard and dotted with dried cherries, craisins, and pine nuts the steaming hot bread pudding was of good quality and firm texture; a good but not stunning representation on its own.  Moving next to the toppings - a trio of brown sugar streusel, praline cream, and American Oak ice cream the overall effect was sweet, sweet, and sweet - not inherently a bad thing, but a bit of overkill.

V...the customer service alone gets 5 stars, but when you factor in the semi-annual sales it is more like 6.  Having been to a number of Nordstrom's in multiple cities I'd put this particular location on the same level as those in San Francisco (without the assinine traffic to contend with) and Seattle and only a notch below the best of the best in Chicago.  \u000a\u000aLiving in a city with a Nordstrom and a Nordstrom Rack is going to be a daily exercise in resisting temptation.

VReally interesting spot with a four room space featuring the works of many local artists.  Friendly staff and a truly rustic feel not nearly as scrubbed or sterile as other galleries in the area.  While I personally would have preferred actual prices on the works as opposed to a number requiring me to request more information from the staff this is a small quibble as the prices were actually rather reasonable for the quality of the worksmanship.

VGood space, largely friendly staff, and certainly a more forward thinking approach than the other places still harboring Native and Folk Art.  Prices were a bit higher than I'd expect for the quality and names they were exhibiting, but they really do seem to have the corner on the market in the genre of progressive modern art.

VHaving already mentioned my next stop as the primary impetus to visit Tempe in the first place I'll start off by saying I'd originally identified Caffe Boa when browsing SlowFood.com and having subsequently read the profiles of both Jay Wisniewski and his wife on the website I was sold that it was a place to put on my list; a fact that a 50% off coupon from localdines.com certainly did not hurt.  \u000a\u000aLocated on Mill Avenue, a space much maligned by local epicures and gourmands due to the proliferation of ASU "College food" stops such as pizza and burgers Caffe Boa seemed to be a sort of panacea to the area's dining trend with its focus that which is local/fresh/organic and with offerings of brunch, lunch, and dinner I decided to make my fist visit a morning one; an audition, if you will, to see if a dinnertime drive to Tempe would be well advised in the future and recruiting my friend Aileen to join we scheduled for 10am since she had to be at work by 11:30.\u000a\u000aArriving just minutes late largely due to parking issues ($1.50/hr, FYI, though there is rumor of a free lot) after spending some time wandering around Mill and the ASU campus I entered Caffe Boa to find the restaurant much larger than I'd anticipated from the website and with only one other table occupied and my friend already arrived it would not be long before our server stopped by, told us of the mimosa table ($15,) and explained the new menu before filling Aileen's coffee and a glass of water with cucumber for each of us.\u000a\u000aHaving each browsed the menu prior to arrival and with $40 to spend it would not be long before our decisions were made and with three plates to be shared amongst us ordered it would also not be long until we were left to wait...and wait...and wait...nearly twenty minutes before someone returned to prepare my friend water without cucumber and nearly fifty minutes before our food arrived; Aileen now likely to be late for work and myself simply hoping the food would be worth the wait.\u000a\u000aBeginning first with the savory as my morning visit to Essence had been quite sweet the Croissant Croque Monsieur (sans Dijon) along with an egg requested to be soft poached would prove to be the first disappointment of the day as the overall composition of the dish was simply poorly conceived - the croissant lacking any crunch and weighted down by the cheese, the béchamel largely blurred by the brine of the ham, and the $2 most certainly not soft poached (especially since a quality kitchen can sous vide a perfect 63-degree egg in less time than Boa prepared this one.)  The salad was fresh and the dish was edible, but at $16...even with the localdines certificate I felt ripped off.\u000a\u000aMoving next to a pair of sweets, Aileen opted for the Parisian Crepes with Apricot preserves, Crème Chantilly, and Berries and requesting the dish without powdered sugar I think we both kind of chuckled at the lackluster presentation but unlike the croque this dish was at least tasty; the crepes dainty with a goodly amount of sweet filling and the crème light yet flavorful but at $12 probably not enough to satiate all but the slightest appetite.\u000a\u000aFor our final (and certainly most decadent) taste of Boa an order of Stuffed Pain Perdu arrived featuring two pieces of brioche wrapped around a light layer of mascarpone and Nutella that was subsequently battered and dipped in hazelnuts prior before a trip to the pan.  Nicely caramelized with an exterior still featuring a bit of crunch and an interior just short of custard plus a topping of caramelized bananas, raisins, and maple the overall flavor profile was certainly sweet but at the same time nicely balanced and certainly a step up from the rest of the morning...even if nearly twice the price and half as good as the French Toast at Essence just hours before.  A 60 minute wait and $40 (plus tax and tip) for 3 items - only one of which was even remotely memorable - let's just say Caffe Boa won't see a starring role in my dinner plans any time soon.

VI've been to a number of NHL arenas and amongst the "new school" of NHL arenas this is undoubtedly one of the best; it is a shame that not enough people show up for the games to appreciate it.\u000a\u000aStarting first with the location - essentially in the midst of a large shopping and entertainment complex - there is no shortage of people watching and things to do before and after the game.  Next add in the free parking, another huge perk for someone not a stranger to spending $20 to park a car in Detroit.\u000a\u000aEntering the arena everything is clean and well maintained while the ice surface is kept in pristine condition by cooling the entire building to arctic levels almost as if to avoid any criticism of playing a cold weather sport in the Valley of the Sun.\u000a\u000aSeating is comfortable and the sight lines are pristine while the open view of the surface from the upperdeck is innovative and a nearly "bowl" like experience unlike any other.\u000a\u000aDear Phoenix, there is a good chance I'll be moving to your city, please find a local buyer for the damned team so I have an excuse to come here more often.  You'll never be my favorite team, but I'll contribute to a season tickets package and cheer for you anytime you're not playing the Kings.

VItems Selected:\u000aApple Fritter\u000aApple Bearclaw\u000aBlueberry Cake\u000aOld Fashioned\u000aBismarck\u000aCherry Glaze Cruller\u000a\u000aFreshly transplanted to Las Vegas just days prior and with friends new and old in town an early morning trek after my typical morning run landed me at the doors of Friendly Donut House just after 5:30am, the Henderson breakfast staple already playing host to a sextet of elderly gentlemen holding court over coffee plus a pair of folks joining in.  Truly oldschool in terms of design, variety, and price with customers more like kin to the friendly staff it was clear on entry that the presence of a camera was not common around these parts and inquiring into my business I briefly explained, the end result a few laughs and rolled eyes followed by a multitude of suggestions and one congenial fellow refusing to allow me to pay, instead suggesting my half dozen be "placed on his tab," a tab the clerk suggested he never pays anyhow.  Thanking everyone involved and taking my selections to the street it would not be long before the tasting began and opting for variety the most remarkable thing about Friendly was consistency; each fried pastry a textbook example of its genre with light yeastiness to the raised options and supple textures beneath a crisp glaze on the buttermilk and blueberry.  Moving next to an impressive Bismarck suggested to me as 'can't miss' by the table of two and then to a delicate cruller with thick cherry glaze it was largely expected that what followed would represent "saving the best for last" and sure enough both enormous bearclaw filled with spiced apples and the crispy apple fritter would prove the best I've found in Las Vegas and although perhaps not 'destination' worthy, certainly worth a visit for those in or around Henderson.

V...I like Southwest.  I really do.  I have the credit card, enjoy the fact that those who register get a better seat, and even though I rarely use it I'm glad my bags fly free.  That said, in my last 5 flights out of McCarran four of them have been on Southwest and ALL 5 have met with substantial delays - only one related to weather and 3 on Southwest for inexplicable reasons such as staffic or plane maintenance.  Understanding the importance of flying safe and glad that they care about their customers there is a part of me that is reassured by questionable flights being held back, but also a part of me that would like to buy with confidence knowing I'll get where I'm going as promised.

Dimly lit with stone walls, wood beams, heavy linens, and art-glass chandeliers overhead it was to formal greetings and a rose for the ladies that we arrived in the Cellar and whisked away soon to a booth in one of several rooms the action soon commenced, each waiter presented by name as a trio of warm breads with a butter rose plus the famous tableside salad engaged the senses - the later a true crowd pleaser carefully customized for each and every guest.  Large in menu with a bar that promised to craft "anything you like" it was with a stiff pair of $7 cocktails that our proper order progressed and soon plucking tender snails under delicate pastry from their dish one really couldn't help but smile at a classic done so well, a theme continued with each of three superlative entrees following a raspberry palate cleanse - the tableside whole duckling a showstopper gathering looks from around the room while the Wellington rivaled that at Ramsay Steak beneath a pile of mushrooms and foie gras.  Truly a class act it was prior to desserts-proper that a trio of chocolate dipped fruits arrived to be dressed in hand-whipped cream and with more sweets offered on the house to celebrate a duo of birthdays it was tableside we turned again - the smolder and burn of booze, fresh fruit, and cinnamon ladled over rich ice cream a refined finish to a true 'experience.'

VBest of the old school casinos.  Excellent gaming tables and service, here is the place where you're likely to see the hardcore gamers and gamblers......y'know, the dudes who come up in a T-shirt and Wrangler jeans and drop $10K on the craps table without batting an eye.  Its a cooler scene than the CEO playing $5,000 per hit blackjack at the Wynn.....these dudes are REALLY into it and they know their dealers.\u000a\u000aThe swimming pool with the central fish tank was very badass, as was the enormous namesake Gold Nugget.\u000a\u000aI'm a South Strip kinda person because I dig the fine dining an fancy shops, but this place is A-Ok.

VEvery bit the 'locals' casino it bills itself to be but with an RV park on site to draw on-the-cheap travelers as well I have to admit I kind of enjoy the divey vibe of Sam's Town.  Ample in parking without all the hassles intrinsic to the strip plus great deals of films in their recently revamped theaters and a huge bank of penny slots plus $3 Blackjack and Poker this is the sort of place where a little money can go a long way towards having a good time and although food options are sorely lacking there are plenty of local spots worth checking out within a short drive.  Convenient and clean plus a straight shot down the road from work, suffice it to say I think I've found my new go-to movie theater and quirky little hangout for wasting a few bucks over the course of a few hours.

VConvenient only as I happened to be driving back from an appointment this is one of the least well maintained and bleak Walmart locations I've seen in quite some time.  Back in the days of community Walmart small towns like Fremont or Port Clinton Ohio this may have sufficed, but to call this picked over and dank location a "Super" Walmart leaves me to wonder what the 'standard' Walmart looks like these days.

Kitsch in décor with a pervasive log cabin theme speckled by bears both stuffed and carved it was to the tunes of the Four Tops that I entered Black Bear Diner and greeted first by a host behind the small pastry case and then by my server, Ray, the morning progressed in two courses with countless cups of coffee, the carving action outside visible through the windows while I dined.  Starting sweet and progressing sweeter it was to the flavor of custard-rich, ice cream crowned bread pudding that the meal began and rife with caramel, pecans, and raisins the steamy block proved surprisingly light while a duo of fresh baked breads with whipped butter and honey proved equally well done; the $0.99 cornbread toothsome and buttery while the $2.39 biscuit was so fluffy it literally flaked apart to the tooth.  Working slowly through the trio as wood chips flew it was only after the pudding was polished off that Ray put in my order for round-two and arriving piping hot the quartered cinnamon roll dressed in eggy batter and fried golden was superb, a light drizzle of cream cheese frosting mingling with the surprise of pure maple syrup into pure decadence - the sort of dish best taken with milk or coffee...and perhaps even better, shared.  At this point taking my leave and settling the bill it was with two additional items that I exited the cozy confines of the Black Bear and saving them until hours later suffice it to say that it was with some disappointment that I found the signature bear claw's pastry poorly laminated around pasty nut filling while the requested "Cinnamon Apple Bavarian Cream Pie" had been substituted by a standard, albeit delicious, traditional Apple Pie with a glossy butter crust instead - next time I guess I'll just have to enjoy all three courses at the table instead.

VI can't really complain too much since I got the room for a mere $69 after tax.  They held my bags for 6 hours before I checked in.  Check-in and Checkout were efficient w/o the wait I had at other Vegas places.  The casino is kinda lame but I had fun playing bubble hockey and airhockey with my friend in the basement kids area.  \u000a\u000aCertainly wouldn't eat here or come here for a special occassion, but for a simple place to stay so I could save my money for shopping, dining, and events?  Sure.  Its a comfy bed with a lockable door, a shower with hot water, and clean towels.  Nice soaps and ESPN, too.

VFor the price, still decent - I wouldn't go here on a Honeymoon or to impress that special lady, but for a weekend or day in Vegas flying solo it is a room, a comfortable bed, and a TV......plus, the only $5 Gym in Las Vegas - and the gym is nice.  The number of free games, drinks, and coupons given at checkin actually covered the price of the room.

Fluid in service from beginning to end despite our request for courses to be served family style it was with bread and a sturdy, aromatic Margherita that our evening began and moving through a silky round of foie with decidedly sweet accoutrements it was with a trio of pastas that the meal truly began to wow, each a textbook preparation of the respective noodle/dumpling and the sauces rich without being heavy - particularly the meltingly-thin ravioli.  Clearly over ordering but happy to indulge, a single secondi of lightly braised lamb arrived rife with grassy notes beneath a savory glaze while the accompanying bowl of polenta proved sticky, rich, and decadent - the latter carrying right over to desserts, each excellent but the towering cloud of banana truly special and every bit as good as the one being served next door, still one of my favorite soufflés to date.

VObviously Neiman Marcus is expensive no matter where you go, but unlike most of their stores this location at Fashion Show benefits in one big way - by being in Vegas, where the rich and the middle class often mingle and look similar to the retail eye, the typical pretense reserved for "elite" clientele  is left out as each and every clerk is well dressed, well mannered, and incredibly helpful whether you're dressed in a Led Zeppelin T-Shirt or suited by Louis Vuitton.  Featuring particularly impressive sales, particularly around the holidays, and the same impressive selection as Neiman Marcus in New York or San Francisco I can't say I have the time or inclination to shop here frequently, but it also never hurts to go in and look when everyone is so pleasant and the store is so well polished.

I wasn't buying, but certainly browsing and the sales staff was great, even taking my Carrera and polishing it for me while I tried on a couple Baume and Merciers, a Ball, and a Zenith.\u000a\u000aTwo stories of designer watches is pretty much my fantasy land.

Honestly, no matter how big an M+M fan you are, in a city where Vosges, Payard, Jean Philippe, Ethyl's, and about 100 other shoppes are within 1/4 mile......why bother?

Decidedly 'hole-in-the-wall" with spotty floors and shaky tables yet a nearly full dining area during my 10am visit the collection set out before me consisted of mostly the standards and going the "standard" route with two of my favorites I deferred another pair to the young lady at the counter before paying the $4 cash tab and settling into a two-top.  Informed that nothing was technically "hot" as the days baking is mostly concluded at the 3:30am opening results were largely expected; the cake doughnuts outshining those raised while the fritter proved far superior to Ronald's or Al's with glazed crunch overlying a fluffy, oilless interior rife with cinnamon and pockets of what appeared to be skin-on chopped apples.

VNormally I'm a big fan of Nordstrom - but in a city where store customer service is generally top notch I found the employees at this particular branch chilly at best.  For a store that generally trumps Macy's in every other US city I actually prefer the Macy's at Fashion Show to the Nordstrom by a longshot - better deals, better service, less crowded as well.

VA clean layout with that "grungy but well dressed" feel that makes it easy for persons like Iggy Pop or the fellas from ZZ Top to model his wares - the stores is excellent.  Browsing the pieces, exclusively mens, I did manage to identify some items that I liked but the size selection was incredibly limited - especially compared to the amazing CBGB's convert flagship in NYC.\u000a\u000aCan't really fault Varvatos for his prices - it is what it is and the materials are great.

Certainly not a store for everyone but a man who has earned my respect with both his fashion and his people.

VLocated in Summerlin but for some reason sporting a pair of security officers at the door during both of my visits it seems somewhat strange to me that this book store needs much 'protection' given the upper-middle class clientele, but what is even more perplexing to me is how this place stays in business considering their across-the-board high prices and substantial overcrowding of the floor space.  Generally trending $2-$6 higher than Amazon even before taking tax into account and seemingly happy to hire clerks that value neither their own knowledge of the store layout nor the customer's time the only positive I can say for B&N is that it is within walking distance of my house and when I need something 'now' I don't need to wait for shipping.

VI'm not a big 'commercial pet store' guy, but with this location across the street and questions about potential pets I decided to stop in and I must say I was impressed by the friendly and knowledgable staff.  Debating the pros/cons of various cat breeds and realizing that PetSmart was unlikely to 'push' a breed like the Rex or Sphynx which they do not sell it was surprising just how much the team was happy to discuss the pros (happy, not overly clingly or chatty...and hairless in the case of the Sphyx) vs. cons (price, mostly, plus shortened lifespan and health concerns in some due to inbreeding) while also offering alternative suggestions.  Still not 100% on what precisely I want to buy or whether simply adopting and hoping for the best is in my plans I was quite happy with the folks here...even if it does smell like a pet store.

VLargely unaware of these guys prior to moving to Phoenix last year it was with a smile that I found Aaron Brothers not only in Las Vegas, but steps from my new home with service just as friendly and helpful as the location I frequented in the past.  Fancying a sort of disjointed and varied framing approach throughout my home I've never once entered Aaron Brothers without buying something and whether the plan is to mat, buy something stock, or have a custom option made to order the prices are always fair or better - particularly if you're in a position to wait for a sale.  Featuring more than just frames, including scrapbooking materials and other art supplies plus a few mirrors, posters, and decorations yet lacking the clutter and disarray that plagues Michael's or Hobby Lobby I'm sure it is only a matter of time before I'm back.

VHailing from The Buckeye State and likely owing at least some aspects of my education and the halls in which I received my degrees to the founders of Bath and Body Works I'll simply say that although 'retail' prices are ridiculous, for those willing to wait for a sale it is tough to beat what the company has to offer.  Still somewhat bitter about the discontinuation of Brown Sugar and Fig I've managed to find some solace in Japanese Cherry Blossom and Sweet Pea, while Wallflowers continue to keep my house well perfumed with vanilla notes at all times.  Friendly clerks, good business morals, and supporting my home state - for that I can even tolerate the headache inducing experience of this place at the Holidays.

VAdmitting that I can almost fall out my front door and land at Smith's I simply cannot fathom a reason aside from convenience to visit; the prices all higher than Walmart and the selection no better.  Cramped and crowded, though admittedly with a good number of cashiers and baggers hard at work I chuckled with amusement at the slot machines at the store's exit but less so at the anemic appearing celery at $1.49 a bundle, and even less so at the 99cent heads of lettuce that closely resemble the size of a Cabbage Patch doll from the 80s.  Good in a pinch and apparently frequent to offer sales I'll likely be back when produce begins to run low and I simply don't want to drive anywhere, but alas this cannot be my grocery store of choice.

VSomewhere between an indoor swapmeet and a flea market but largely focused on well maintained antiques, signs, nick-knacks, and other such items at great prices I have to say I'd have liked Antiques At the Market even if it didn't contain Truffles n Bacon Cafe, but with the presence of such a cozy and delicious restaurant I fully loved my visit to the Market.  Ranging from vintage Star Wars toys to Cookie Jars that look like Moses suggesting "Thou shalt not steal (cookies)" plus a variety of old spice boxes, large scale statues, and advertising products from companies like Coca-Cola there is plenty to see here and prices are often a veritable steal.  Well worth a visit on its own, but even better to walk off some of those calories from the bread pudding at Truffles n Bacon.

Having visited the original Santa Monica location with family many years ago and coming away impressed by the food but less so by the service the style of the Mandalay Bay location was decidedly different with a large, open floorplan including al fresco dining and typically professional Las Vegas Strip service delivering selections two at a time as we progressed through 90% of the menu, most of it exemplary in quality considering the $35 price.  Featuring bottomless coffee and beginning with fresh fruit and empanadas before progressing through plates both sweet and savory utilizing organic proteins and produce plus house-made jams, jellies, sauces, and creams highlights of the menu for myself included the fluffy biscuits surrounding peanut butter, jelly, bacon, jalapenos and a fried egg as well as the quesadilla and excellent shrimp and grits but all-in-all it would also be foolish to overlook the quality of the pork belly atop the crispy waffle, clever churro tots, or creamy French toast either - the only problem with these being that I had a real estate appointment and the combination of limited time and so many other choices prevented the ordering of a second round.

A rather small space with a decent selection of classics cake and yeasted donuts plus fritters, cinnamon rolls, and the aforementioned novelties my eventual order entailed a half dozen selections and taking them to enjoy with a friend the results were as mixed as the selections.  Beginning first with the raised options, my pal's preferred variety, both of us felt that the texture of Al's were far less fluffy than necessary - likely the result of over-kneading the dough - and moving onward to my personal choices of a buttermilk bar and a tiny apple fritter the results were better, but still not on par with Ronald's, Coco, Pink Box, or Friendly Donut House.  Hoping for the 'krossants' to save the day I will admit that both versions featured an excellent crunch with good lamination and separation of the interior layers, but with a relative dearth of filling the flavor was largely lost once past the glaze - though the strawberry glaze was admittedly quite excellent.

V...I'm generally a Walmart supporter, but this location was a test of my peopleofwalmart.com identification skills.  Terrible layout, small and cramped, and far too few lanes open to accommodate 1/2 of the people in attendance.  Convenient to one of my two offices it will suffice, but future stops will be few and far between.

VItems experienced:  Blueberry Cake, Strawberry Cake, Chocolate Cake, Bavarian, Coconut Cake, Glazed Twist, Raised Glazed, Cruller, Apple Fritter, Maple Cake, Crumb Cake, Chocolate Raised\u000a\u000aThe last of the novel contenders on the first Las Vegas Donut Crawl, Donut Hut would prove to be a middle-of-the-pack sort of experience with a few definite "go to" options starring amongst an otherwise mundane cast of dry cake donuts and chewy yeasted selections bolstered by quality glazes.  Focusing on what worked as nothing was particularly 'bad' the only two things one truly needs to know here are the words Blueberry Cake and (on the weekend only) Cruller, the former on par with the warm version for which folks wait hours at Orange County's "M +M" and the later a truly remarkable rendition of something infrequently seen and even less frequently well-made, in this case a perfect fried ring of pate a choux with a custard soft center beneath gentle crunch more than worth  getting out of bed early for.

Located in a less than ideal location and not particularly attractive from the outside or within it should suffice to say that a visit to Wo Fat is based more on the food than the ambiance but with service friendly and efficient throughout the off-hour it was with tea and water that the meal began, soon to be followed by a half dozen menu selections - most novel, all well prepared, and a few truly outstanding.  Sampling far and wide with suggestions from everyone including our server it was with plethoric portion that each dish arrived and with both the pork and shrimp stuffed kau gee as well as the beef chow funn excellent while cake noodles and shrimp were commendable if not memorable it was in the pork and the duck that the meal truly shined - the former a complex sort of mild char sui with more aromatics and less sugar proving irresistible on soft bao while the later was simply divine, a tender confit of duck beneath crackling almond paste that added just a touch of sweetness for a mere $9.95.

VWhile I've admittedly never been an Albertson's fan they are generally good in a pinch, high prices and limited selection notwithstanding.  Located on Charleston where there are no less than 10 other grocery stores within a 5 mile stretch I stopped in here for a couple of items early Saturday morning only to find them sold out of frozen broccoli.  Sold out at 8am?  Was there some sort of rush that I was unaware of on an item that costs 30 cents more a pound than the Smith's, Vons, or Walmart down the road?\u000a\u000aSure the folks here are friendly and sure the store is clean, but if you're going to overcharge me the least you can do is keep your shelves stocked.

Nondescript from the exterior but cozy and kitsch inside as a friendly staff bounced between tables with endless refills of coffee from Illy at a mere $2.75 it was to a diverse menu and a hot, yeasty 'pot of bread' slathered with Nutella and toasted almonds that I arrived and after perusing the menu at length an order was placed, a server named Shirley warning me that it would be "a lot of food," but failing to inform me of noted upcharges of $2 for a single Red Velvet Pancake and $1.25 for grits in place of potatoes.  Jovial in spirit with tunes ranging from Sinatra to Madonna playing overhead it was perhaps a ten minute wait after the bread that the rest of my meal arrived and with each item larger than expected in size it was indeed a substantial breakfast with only the cocoa-less Red Velvet failing to impress...the flavor merely that of a decent buttermilk pancake gussied up with $2 in dye.  Speaking to the rest, suffice it to say that it would be hard to mess up something as decadent as the signature "S'Mores" with ample chocolate chips and chocolate syrup finding balance in bold buttermilk, marshmallows, plus a dollop of whipped cream and yet as good as the pancake was, the un-fried riff on the Monte Cristo easily stole the show as golden Texas Toast dipped in custard housed Ham, Turkey, and Swiss of good quality and quantity, all just waiting for a sweet gilding of maple syrup to make flavors pop.  Never one to quibble prices but a firm believer that upcharges should always be disclosed Jamms strikes me as a good-enough place in a city with plenty of similar options; a bit better than some and a bit worse than others...the sort of place I'm sure to revisit at some point for the Waffle Sundae or the Stuffed French Toast, but not before investigating other family owned spots or before second visits to Blueberry Hill, Hash House, Egg & I, or Baby Stacks.

VYou've replaced Walmart as my go to.  You are simply more convenient, more friendly, and although you force me to use a friggin' loyalty card - equally well priced.  Plenty of lanes.  A friendly young woman to bag my groceries.  You even carry Vegas Seven on occasion.  Sure I'd be happy if you would stock more than 20lbs of frozen broccoli at once, but we'll work on that.

VItems Selected:\u000a\u000aButtermilk Bar\u000aStrawberry Raised\u000aBlueberry Cake\u000aApple Fritter\u000a\u000aStepping out of Babystacks well aware that the next eight hours would be spent amidst mountains of boxes and unpacking Dee's simply proved too convenient to pass-up, a quartet of donuts for $3.54 and a "Thank you, happy holidays" our reward for a three minute visit...though in reality only one of the heavily glazed and fried treats would prove "rewarding" at all.  Apparently one in a quartet of Dee's and without anything truly 'novel' it was with little effort that I selected four of my typical favorites and aside from the surprisingly supple though admittedly artificially sweet tasting blueberry cake ring I can only assume one of two things:  #1)  The oily fritter, spongy strawberry, and crumbly, tangless buttermilk were really that mediocre, or #2)  Everything was a day old, the blueberry was so heavily glazed that it somehow had maintained its texture, and the fritter was awful either way.

VBlog for full review:\u000a\u000aHaving now sat for perhaps thirty minutes while pies entered and exited the oven being delivered to many around us the time would finally arrive to taste the oft raved pizza of team Bianco as all four of our selections arrived simultaneously covering the table and filling the air with the smells of smoke, yeast, pork, tomato, and basil.  With much sharing to be done and pictures taken the next twenty or so minutes would consist of much less talking and far more eating than the previous thirty and beginning first with my selection - well - let's just say it lived up to the hype as the ROSA with Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, and Arizona Pistachios may just be the best "specialty pizza" I've ever tasted.  Beginning first with the crust - an expert balancing act between the thinness of a Neapolitan like Lucali and the chewy hole structure of that at Great Lake - it was nearly perfect as the slight char from the wood oven gave each pie a lovely crunch yet pliable interior that could support the ingredients without disturbing them.  Moving next to the toppings - no sauce here - just thinly sliced onions, intense salty cheese, crunchy smooth pistachios, and a touch of rosemary to pique everything else.  Marvelous.\u000a\u000aMoving next to another of Bianco's signatures, the WISEGUY with wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, and Fennel Sausage I was pleasantly surprised by the mildness of both the onions and the fennel, both present but not overwhelming, while the slight spice of the sausage floated above the pools of creamy cow's milk mozzarella.  Another well balanced pie, though I do feel it could have done with just a touch less olive oil...a small quibble, to be sure.\u000a\u000aFor the third choice, the BIANCOVERDE with Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, and Arugula would be the only pizza we modified from the menu description - in this case by adding a $3 supplement of Organic 'La Quercia' Prosciutto Americano from Iowa that was every bit worth the cost.  Again featuring that same pliable smoky crust but this time topping it first with the trio of cheeses before adding the arugula and prosciutto after it exited the oven this "Salad Pizza" was a valuable addition to the lineup largely because of the quality of the ingredients and the balance achieved by using each lightly.  From the smooth mozzarella to the puddles of ricotta and tangy Parmigiano up through the slight bitters of the greens and the powerful saline notes of the pork everything simply clicked though for some the lack of spice was an issue - an issue easily amendable by the red pepper provided on request (try getting that at Una, Lucali, or Great Lake.)\u000a\u000aFor the final selection, that of the man who'd experienced Chris' work longer and more frequently than the rest of us combined, there was no way I was going to miss out on the MARGHERITA while I was here and thankfully he'd ordered it (thus preventing me from ordering both it and the ROSA.)  With the stars of the show well known - simply the freshest Tomato Sauce with light hints of sweetness, oregano, and garlic plus Fresh Mozzarella, and Basil - this was a no nonsense sort of pie that hit on all cylinders; tangy, creamy, aromatic, smoky, and perfect.  While not the absolute greatest Margherita I've ever had, a top 5 member for sure and when paired with the rest of the menu, the service, and the setting a pizza definitely worthy of the fame especially considering the fact that Bianco uses all local ingredients including tomatoes from California in the making of his sauce.\u000a\u000aEating, sharing, talking, and then eating some more while the service checked in occasionally to see if we needed anything else our time at Bianco felt much longer than it was and when it was all said and done only four slices remained - two of the WISEGUY and two the BIANCOVERDE - all wrapped up and going home with their respective owners while I took home with me the memories of some of the best pizza I've ever experienced and (perhaps more importantly) the experience of meeting with some great people for outstanding pizza in a setting where people have a passion for what they are doing without all the pretense.  Yeah Chris didn't build the oven and furniture by hand like Lucali, and perhaps Pizzeria Bianco doesn't fly all their ingredients in from Italy like Una, and sure Chris' health prevents him from being ever present at the oven like Dom at DiFara or Nick at Great Lake but in the end the results are the same...this is some really great pizza well worth going out of your way for.

VFull review blogged.  High points below:\u000a\u000aA native of a small town in the Midwest surrounded by farms heavily populated by Latino workers each summer of my youth I'm a bit ashamed to admit that overall my experience with "Mexican" food in general has been quite abysmal.  Sure there were childhood experiences with Little Mexico in Detroit before or after games at Joe Louis Arena and yes I've visited a few of Rick Bayless' spots in the Second City but beyond that and Border Grill in Los Angeles the closest I've been to South of the Border cuisine is Don Pablos...or perhaps Chi-Chi's before they filed for bankruptcy.  With these glaring omissions in my culinary education admitted and in part due to my overall lack of enthusiasm for spicy foods I promised myself going into this trip to Arizona that I would make an effort to at least hit some of the more upscale spots in order to "ease myself in" and the first of these stops would be at The Barrio Café.\u000a\u000aGoing light on the bread as it was somewhat uninspiring and the plates coming from the kitchen were surprisingly large it would be around twenty minutes after seating that my "appetizer" would arrive in the form of Tacos de Cochinita Pibil, four Mayan style slow roasted suckling pig tacos wrapped in house made tortillas with a side of Yucca fries, chipotle ketchup, and salsa Yucateca.  Beginning first with the tacos I'll simply say that while it may not mean much considering my lack of experience these were without a doubt the best tacos I have ever had.  Double wrapped due to the moistness of the succulent meat each bite was savory and smoky with a light acidity kissing the tongue as the queso fresco tamed everything.  Deftly spiced with any number of flavors foreign to my palate and going back and forth with the tasty fries I think the thing that really stood out to me with this dish was that while the "heat" was there, it served a purpose - pushing forward more unique tones like cinnamon, nutmeg, cumin, and even sweetness from the meat.\u000a\u000aFor my main course; a dish titled Pato en Tamarindo or "Seared breast of duck in a striking sweet & sour tamarind & chipotle pepper sauce."  With my love of duck well documented and already quite impressed with the flavor profile of the preceding tacos I have to say I went into this dish with high expectations and was met only half-way.  Beginning first with the accoutrements - mashed yucca with poblano peppers and asparagus with onions, both were tasty and well prepared if not particularly memorable.  Moving on to the duck, similarly well prepared with the breast first pounded thin and then sautéed prior to a final sear, the issue with this dish would flash back to my complaint about "spice" because while the menu said "duck" my palate merely said "protein" as the flavors of the fowl were entirely obliterated by the thick notes of smoke, pepper, and slight bitters.  A good dish, sure, but for someone who truly loves duck I simply wanted to be able to taste it.\u000a\u000aWith the duck now consumed and feeling reasonably full but certainly not "stuffed" Esequiel again stopped by with a big smile stating "Nice job, I knew you could do it.  But did you save room for dessert?" - an obvious 'yes' which led to perhaps Barrio Café's most famous dish arriving at my table just ten minutes later.  Entitled "Churros Rellenos de Cajeta de Cabra" and trumping either of the previous dishes in overall mass this marvelous plate was composed of essentially five things and all five of them things I love; deep fried cinnamon doughnuts, chocolate, caramel, strawberries, and ice cream.\u000a\u000aBeginning first with the Churros - flawless, light, and crisp on the exterior with molten goats milk caramel spilling forth as they were cut...in all honestly they could have stopped here and I'd have been happy, but instead opting to pair this with an enormous double scoop of fresh vanilla bean ice cream drizzled with more caramel, slightly peppery "Mexican hot chocolate" and fresh strawberries...sure it was $12 for churros, but it is $12 I'd gladly spend again as I ate every last bite of the crunchy yet creamy concoction and spent another three or four minutes scraping the plate clean with my spoon.\u000a\u000aWith Esequiel returning yet again and asking, jokingly, if I'd enjoyed the churros he inquired (I hope jokingly) if there was anything else he could get me and telling him no, that the bill, I waited for a few moments while my tab was calculated - an admittedly pricey $58 after tax and tip - and with the bill paid I thanked the my servers for such a great afternoon before making my way back out into the sun.  Thankful for the meal that just was for opening my eyes in to a cuisine I've far too long overlooked I've no doubt that Barrio Café is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the Valley's Mexican scene, but considering what they say about first impression's I'm glad Chef Esparza and her team made a good one.

VThe hotel is dark and dumpy while the food and drink options are slim pickings, but that isn't really why anyone goes here - is it?  Free January trips to the top for locals is pretty much all you need to know and with excellent views and a light crowd I'd recommend everyone do it at least once - touristy for sure, but far cheaper (and taller, and less of a hassle) than the Seattle Space Needle or the St. Louis Arch.

VDishes sampled include:  \u000a\u000aTod Mun Plar - Deep Fried Fish Cake with Curry Paste, Cucumber Salad, Chopped Peanut\u000a\u000aKoong Sarong - Marinated Prawn wrapped in Bacon and Wonton wraps, deep fried, sweet and sour\u000a\u000aNam Kao Tod - Crispy Rice with Sour Sausage, Green Onion, Fresh Chili, Ginger, Peanuts, Lime Juice\u000a\u000aCrispy Duck on Drunken Noodle with Fresh Chili and Thai Basil\u000a\u000aBeef Balls Noodle Soup with small rice noodles\u000a\u000aHoh Mok Seafood - Steamed with egg, sliced cabbage, coconut milk, curry sauce, cooked in tinfoil with its own juices\u000a\u000aFried mussel omelet on top of sautéed bean sprout, green onion, spicy sweet sauce\u000a\u000aOften traveling and dining solo or with persons not so adventurous I'm always glad when a friend or even a stranger is interested in dining somewhere outside my typical focus and on Christmas Eve, with a number of restaurants closed even in Las Vegas, I was fortunate to have an acquaintance well established in the food industry invite me to dine with he and his girlfriend at Lotus of Siam.  Surely the most 'famous' restaurant in Las Vegas and debatably the most well-known place for Thai in the United States the nondescript strip-mall location on Sahara Ave had always been on my "to visit" list and although my heat tolerance is still quite novice what I found at LoS was well within my comfort zone and aside from the nearly ninety minute wait for a seat and perfunctory service all of it was really quite delicious.\u000a\u000aFortunate to visit on a day when Chef Saipin was in the kitchen and the crowd was largely local our table of three tried as best we could to sample a wide but manageable amount of food from various areas of the immense menu and deferring once or twice to our server, Pha, we requested items arrive in a couple of courses as opposed to all at once; a request honored leading to seven plates in three rounds, each plate nicely presented, piping hot, and all but the Beef Ball soup full of flavor.\u000a\u000aBeginning first with savory fish cakes aromatic and spicy, prawns snappy and fresh with dipping sauce far sweeter than sour, and crispy rice with citrus proving an admirable foil to funky sausage the meal began with a bang only to falter slightly in the second round where the seafood shined while the aforementioned soup fell flat and the duck, advertised as crispy, was actually rather limp but quite delicious as the garlicky noodles, laden with fish sauce, provided needed balance to the substantial heat.  Last, largely because the kitchen forgot we ordered it until we inquired, but certainly not least - the Mussel Omelet arrived resembling a savory funnel cake - a slight sweetness beneath the brine and along with the Nam Kao Tod and Hoh Mok evidence to me that any subsequent trip to Lotus of Siam would see me focus even more strongly on seafood - particularly the snapper and catfish - while also taking a look at the Northern Thai menu.

VUnlike many, I do not judge a restaurant by it's "location."  Just because something is in Las Vegas doesn't mean I will rate it lower than if it were in Columbus.  If possible, I'd give Emeril's Fish House 2.5 stars, but because of the experience and the dessert, I'll bump up.\u000a\u000aWent to Emeril's before Frozen Fury X last year, both my buddy and I dressed in LA purple.  Although not "fine dining" I worried that we would be underdressed, yet fortunately most of the people in the MGM were there for the same reason.  Go Kings Go.\u000a\u000aService was prompt, friendly, attentive, and intelligent.  Although clearly not a Kings fan, she knew the right questions to ask and was quite personable.  Bread (delicious garlic bread and a not-quite-Mina-quality cornbread) were served promptly and refilled continuously.  Drinks and water were also promply attended to.\u000a\u000aFor my meal I opted for Cedar Grilled Yellowtail with Potatoes while my buddy selected Filet Oscar.  While both presentations were relatively simple, the plating was attractive, the food was very fresh, and portions were adequate for the prices.  For a side we split Lobster Mac n' Cheese that was incredibly creamy and cheesy, yet with enough lobster that it wasn't overwhelmed.  Definitely the highlight before dessert arrived.\u000a\u000aFor dessert I was delighted to see two of my favorite items combined, one from the 95% of the time I eat healthy, and the other from the 5% when I don't; Sweet Potato Bread Pudding.  Served with a caramel cookie and marscapone icecream I'd say this was one of the 5 best Bread puddings I've tasted, though nowhere near the one at Emeril's Orlando location.  My friend choose a flourless chocolate cake with a Godiva liquor milkshake that, although small, was enjoyed greatly by my friend.\u000a\u000aAll told, I've certainly had better meals, but the place was above average 'dinner out.'  Perhaps I overrate it for great presentations of my favorite bread and one of my favorite desserts, but all told I think Emeril is a pretty decent chef who people like to pick on because he is a little over the top.  The man can cook.  Thats what matters.

VSee profile site for full review with formatted pics.\u000a\u000a\u000aPerhaps it was Boulud, perhaps Keller.....at some point someone decided that a 99cent cheeseburger at McDonalds simply wasn't enough.  Foie Gras, Truffles, Shrimp, Lobster.....you name it, you got it.  While I do find it odd that I found myself being led into Burger Bar by my friend when I don't particularly like beef and don't eat burgers, I will admit to have had a few in the past and my all-time was the Thurman Burger in Columbus Ohio, a famous one in its own right.  In a day that included Tableau for breakfast and Alex for dinner I must say I didn't expect much from the Burger Bar....but I was pleasantly surprised.\u000a \u000aWhile the Bar was located in a shopping mall at Mandalay Bay I didn't judge....most of Vegas feels like a mall anyhow and Per Se in NYC is located in a mall, as well.  Arriving around 2:30pm there was a line...a good sign I guess....our names were taken and 10 minutes later we found ourselves seated at a 4-top in the middle of the restaurant.  While the place was quite loud, conversation was quite easy and our menus were delivered quickly.  With 5-6 bread options, 5-6 meat options, 40-50 topping options, plus desserts it actually took longer to order than we had imagined.  Eventually I settled on the Turkey Burger on Ciabatta with grilled Shrimp, Pesto, and a side order of Sweet Potato fries while my buddy opted for the Kobe Beef Burger with Sharp Cheddar and Hickory Bacon on Whole Wheat with Spicy Skinny Fries and a sampler of beers.\u000a \u000aAs the place was busy we chatted for a bit and I decided to get up and explore.  Much to my surprise the kitchen was wide open for viewing and I wandered about to realize how fresh all the ingredients were, the bread being baked in visible ovens, and the meats stored in large lockers.  Everything appeared very hygienic and clean, very much unlike your average burger shack.  By the time I arrived back at the table my buddy was working on his beer and approximately two minutes later the food arrived.  While I spent a moment dressing my burger and eating my incredibly garlicky pickle spear, I heard my buddy partially-moan....clearly he was loving this burger.\u000a \u000aOnce my burger was adequately dressed and I had a large pile of ketchup for my fries it was time to dig in.  Crisp ciabatta with a fluffy interior first greeted my tongue followed by the wonderful basil blast of the pesto mingling with plump and tender shrimp and well cooked yet juicy turkey.  Great texture, quality ingredients, wonderful flavor, well cooked....what more can you ask for in a burger?  I next dug into the fries which were simply fantastic and #3 only to Michael Mina's Duck Fat Fries and Michael Symon's Lola Fries in terms of crispy outside and soft/salty inside.  I do find it rather unfortunate that the restaurant did not order an organic/original ketchup given the quality of the ingredients otherwise, but I guess a minimal amount of HFCS won't kill me.\u000a \u000aHaving finished off our burgers and laughing more at the PTI analysis of the USC/Oregon State result my buddy and I opted for a dessert burger - the chocolate version featuring a split donut topped with a chocolate gnache puck, mango "cheese", and strawberries.  Humorous in presentation and tasty in flavor, this choice was excellent and split down the middle this "burger" was just enough after the huge burger/fries.  The mango cheese was especially surprising in its fresh taste and jello-like texture while the chocolate puck was so rich I doubt I'd have finished one myself.  The donut was a tad dry, IMO, but didn't hurt the burger overall.\u000a \u000aAll told I liked the energy and the food at Burger Bar.  While certainly our most "low class" meal, I actually enjoyed the experience and the pricetag more than Sensi and Craftsteak and my buddy loved it which was excellent since he humored me in going to so many French restaurants on the weekend.  IMO, foie and truffles are best served by a chef like Stratta or Savoy and not on a piece of beef and buried under toppings...the concept of the Rossini Burger is ludicrous and anyone ordering it is showing off and missing out on the opportunity for more originality and customization at a lower price.  Regardless, to each his/her own and I think the concept of designer burgers has a lot to offer...even if the underdressed and uncustomizable option at Father's Office is still the standard by which most burgers are judged.

VI don't really like BBQ.  I don't really like Southwest Style cooking.  I actually don't really like Bobby Flay or his cocky attitude either...\u000a\u000a...I liked Mesa Grill.\u000a\u000aWhile the location may not do it for some, my buddy and I stopped in here for a quick bite to eat while betting on the NFL games as it is in direct view of the Sportsbook at Caesars.  \u000a\u000aImmediately on being seated we were brought a complimentary bread basket with absolutely amazing jalapeno corn bread, biscuits, and a cheesy garlic bread that was out of this world.  I ordered a diet coke which was repeatedly refilled and we were not charged for despite sitting around BSing for nearly 2 hours while my buddy drank two beers that he noted were well priced.\u000a\u000aFor meals, my buddy ordered the Mesa Burger with Double Cheddar Cheese, Grilled Vidalia Onion, and Horseradish Mustard on a House Roll with Southwest fries.....the burger was enormous and per his word "awesome."  I opted for the Thick Cut Ahi Tuna Nachos with spicy aoili and blue corn tortillas.  While it appears this amazing dish has since been removed from the menu, I still contest it is one of the 3 best forms of raw tuna I've yet to consume.  The portion was large and at only $11 my total bill with tip for 2 baskets of bread, nachos, soda, and 2 hours of hanging out was a mere $15.\u000a\u000aWhile this isn't "5 star" dining, it is one heck of a deal for high quality food in a nice 'bar' setting when in Vegas.  In retrospect I wish I'd have ordered dessert, but with dinner reserves at Simon later that evening I didn't want to overindulge.....y'know, after eating the Paris buffet for breakfast.

VPretty darn high end in all the right ways.  Outdoors, Indoors, Movie Theater, Dining - all the standard stuff - but done up nice and pretty.  Sure it is expensive but in all reality it didn't feel stuffy at all.\u000a\u000aI loved the furniture stores and the decidedly Arizona feel to some of the shops while mainstays like Boss, Ferragamo, Gucci, and Armani all hold down the haute couture end quite well.\u000a\u000aAdd in the free parking and air conditioning - if I end up in the area I've no doubt I'll be here frequently and my bank account will be none too fond of it.

VLike New York City, the traffic flow through this place is atrocious.....partially due to construction and partially due to the people inside.  Smokey and dark, I can't say I particularly liked anything about NYNY aside from the ESPNZone where I grabbed a soda and watched Sportscenter.\u000a\u000aAffordable but a tad far from the Strip, you'd think they could've recruited one of the high end NYC eateries like Le Cirque, B+B, Payard, Il Mulino, or others to come in here and improve the dining scene.  No Juniors is another huge miss.  A David Chang Vegas franchise could definitely elevated NYNY.

VIn most cities The Mirage would stand out, but aside from its central location there is really not much 'special' about this property on Las Vegas Boulevard.  Certainly a fine hotel and cheaper than some depending on deals and discounts, but bargain travelers can stay cheaper and luxury travelers would likely be let down.

VSee profile site for full review with formatted pics.\u000a\u000a\u000aHaving taken the early flight to Vegas and catching a quick breakfast at Payard, a late lunch at Delmonico was just what the doctor ordered.  Not a steak eater, the choice may seem a tad unusual until one realizes that this was now my fourth Emeril restaurant and fourth time I'd be sampling his take on Shrimp and Bread Pudding.  To be fair, I find it unfortunate that so many people consider Emeril a "sell-out" because he is on TV....he is still a good cook with some great recipes and one of the few celeb chefs who actually keeps his restaurants open for lunch along with dinner.  \u000a\u000aOn first impression, Delmonico seems rather boring in design.  A front bar/lounge and a back dining room with mostly whites and woods - Elegant but "home-y" would be the best way to describe it, yet slightly odd with the single spotlights peering down on each table.  Arriving around 1:45 I was toward the end of lunch hour, but was seated immediately at a four top in the front.  \u000a\u000aThe menu and bread were delivered swiftly, yet despite my knowing exactly what I wanted it took 15 minutes before the waiter returned for my order.  Creamy BBQ Shrimp with Fresh Baked Rosemary Biscuit, please.  \u000a\u000aOrder placed, I was given "bread" and "butter" from a side serving table....the bread was cool and dry while the butter was a block of ice....poor form.\u000a\u000aUnchecked upon until the arrival of my shrimp around 2:30pm, I sat and listened to the table behind me and took some pictures.  Thankfully, when my meal did arrive, the Chef's cooking once again spoke volumes.  7 huge shrimp, 3 small rosemary biscuits, and a sauce that can only be described as a mixture of honey, hickory, and cream with a slight bit of spice....it was lovely.  With all the shrimp finished and significant sauce left over, I requested more bread and this time was \u000athankfully brought two piping hot rolls glistening with butter.  While these were delicious and used for mopping up the sauce, it does not excuse the awful first bread service.\u000a\u000aWith my main gone a different waiter appeared and asked if I'd like dessert.  Darn right I said, having sampled 3 of Emeril's Bread Puddings in the past (one of them twice....we actually went back to Emeril's of Orlando for Bread Pudding after the version at Emeril's Tchoup Chop disappointed....not that I'm obsessed with bread pudding or anything.)  On the menu at Delmonico?  Banana Bread Pudding w/ Oreo Ice Cream.  \u000a\u000aServed in a tiny pot, the moist and liquidy Banana Bread was fantastic, yet so hot that it had turned the ice cream into a melting puddle before it even arrived.  The icecream itself was pretty standard fare and didn't really compliment nor detract from the pudding.  Having had Banana Bread Pudding twice in the past, this was the worst of the three and nowhere near as good as the Sweet Potato Bread Pudding at Emeril's Fish House or the Bourbon Cinnamon version at Citywalk Orlando.  As many have noted before, Vegas seems to have a thing for runny bread pudding, yet the three best I've tried in Vegas have all been the more dry version.  \u000a\u000aAll told, the shrimp was truly standout while all other aspects of the meal were pretty average....and the cold bread....poor poor from.  From what I've heard the steaks here are delicious and I'd certainy return to sample other menu items, but given the vast number of Vegas choices (and two better Emeril restaurants, IMO) I doubt I'll be back.

VIn terms of layout this is probably my favorite hotel in Vegas, particularly as it hosts Frozen Fury each year and houses the Joel Robuchon restaurants.  Lacking in shopping and thus depleted of much of the tourists that plague center strip places with pleasant staff, less smoke than many, and decent prices plus convenient monorail access I'm generally quite pleased each time I visit.

VThe day after a superb dinner at Guy Savoy (getting in later than my friends who were in Vegas to "party" and still waking up before them) I woke up early - feeling great I went for a run outside, the first time I'd ever done so in Vegas - what they say about it being "a dry heat" is right and the mornings are dry and cool - running from the Venetian down to Mandalay Bay and back I was more dehydrated than I normally am on a run twice the distance.  Drinking plenty of water and showering I'd worked up quite an appetite and made my way out for another walk south on the strip - this time to Mon Ami Gabi at Paris.  Arriving at 7:20am I was greeted by the friendly hostesses at the door and led promptly to a prime seat on the patio where I watched Vegas roll by - the best part about early morning Vegas is that there are only two sorts of people - the early morning joggers and the people just heading home.  I laughed like hell when a guy came up and yelled "high five - yellow shirt - I love yellow shirts" with regard to my vintage LA Kings T.  Only in Vegas.\u000a\u000aHaving heard much about Mon Ami Gabi's view - truly awesome sitting 4 feet above Las Vegas Boulevard and directly across from the fountains at Bellagio - I must admit I'd heard mixed reviews of the food and went in with tempered expectations.  Greeted by my server and handed a menu I was offered coffee which I graciously accepted.  A decent French Roast with heavy nuttiness the coffee was good, but probably the worst I had during my trip to Vegas...and refills were slow at best despite the restaurant being unfilled throughout my meal.  Browsing the menu I was impressed by both the sweets and the savories - deciding between the Blueberry French Toast and Poached Pear Waffles proved difficult and thus I ended up with neither.   Placing my order I also opted to order a pain au chocolate from the limited bakery menu.\u000a\u000aSitting for nearly 30 minutes while I waited for my food I sipped my coffee and watched the street - I've said it before and I'll say it again, half the "Vegas Experience" is people watching.  Eventually arriving along with only my first refill of coffee (I had to request it - thankfully after this service improved and a young man took over my coffee refills) I was somewhat surprised when the sweet arrived with my savory breakfast.  Cool and questionably fresh the Pain au Chocolate was appropriately buttery and flakey but lacked any pizzazz.  Featuring a small single vein of average chocolate I could've gotten the same dish for much less than $3.50 at most convenience stores.\u000a\u000aWhere I would consider the sweet a failure - I didn't even finish it - my savory at MAG was actually a unique take on a classic and quite delicious.  Described as a "classic" Croque Madame the dish was actually presented in a "deconstructed" fork and knife sandwich manner with two large slices of hearty grain bread pan fried in butter and then cut in half, topped with ham and gruyere cheese plus chives, and finished with a sunny-side up egg.  Accompanying the croque on the plate was a simple salad of frisee and vinegar and on a side plate were some oily and uninspiring (and decidedly American) hash browns with Heinz ketchup poured into a small cup.  While good this croque and accoutrements certainly wasn't as good as the version the previous day at Pinot and no-where near on par with the versions in Northern California at Butler and the Chef or Bouchon.\u000a\u000aFinishing my meal and sipping on my coffee again my female server finally returned to my table to ask if I needed anything else - when I asked for a "to go" cup of coffee plus the check this duty was pawned off on the young man who'd been filling my coffee while she went back to talking to the other female server near the register.  Like Pinot I simply don't understand why "bistro" entails sub-par service in Las Vegas and I actually mentioned on my way out suggesting that I wanted my tip (left in cash as opposed to on my credit card as I normally do on vacation) be given to the young man and not my "server."  In general I can't say there is much to brag about at Mon Ami Gabi aside from the view and while the restaurant would certainly stand at the top of French cuisine in Columbus Ohio (my home) I'd much sooner go back to Pinot, Bouchon, Payard, or Tableau when in a dining destination city like Las Vegas.

Referred to by some a 'stodgy' with fine porcelain, silver, and lush fabrics to accompany formal service plus a cigar and cognac lounge my experience at Andre's began a few days prior with an E-mail to Ms. Jana Lane Southard requesting a copy of the menu plus a supplemental classic to the chef's tasting and with both requests granted to the tune of a small surcharge the dinner that followed was a true fete of three plus hours of near-perfect food and drink.  Noting up front that beverages were not requested, but instead comped to the tune of me leaving more inebriated than I'd prefer, it was to a glass of brisk bubbly that I was welcomed and proceeding next to the almost-too-rich-for-one "Marti Foie" with a quartet of accoutrements my palate was soon warmed with a gamy croquette serving notice of bold flavors to come.  Moving past mundane bread and frankly disappointing chilled butter it was with my upcharged request of demi-portion of Rochat's classic Thermidor that my tasting began and served in a high-arched bowl the only thing more impressive than the portion was the prep as the butter-poached crustacean proved snappy-sweet amidst a sea of cognac custard studded with tender vegetables and light aromatics.  Opting next for a caramelized seared steak of grade-A foie gras over savory fruitcake tinged with verjus and paired with Tokaji it was only course three that proved anything less than perfection as a slight over-sear dulled a freshly shucked scallop amidst flavors plucked from Robuchon, a small gaff not repeated in the plump sweetbreads or duet of duck - both amongst the most memorable preparations I've found in the state of Nevada.  Transitioning to cheese, an area where I think Andre's could certainly expand its selection, before an impressive palate cleanse it was at long last that a dessert long anticipated arrived; a tall and proud souffle with a tableside finish proving whimsy and perfection can indeed coexist as cocoa, cream, and cinnamon melded seamlessly into an ethereal pudding.  Rounding out the night with brandied cherries, chocolate, and a swig of cognac before settling the tab with a hefty tip it was with nothing but smiles that I exited Andre's; my only regret being that I'd waited so long to do so.

VItems Selected:\u000aCoffee\u000aAmbrosia French Toast, No melon, with whip\u000aCarrot Cake\u000a\u000aRarely one to stay out late and certainly not the sort to do so while drinking heavily only to find myself craving greasy food at 3:00am I'd be lying if I suggested the iconic Peppermill had ever interested me as more than a sort of Las Vegas curiosity and yet with a 12-mile run and a few donuts from Ronald's already under my belt it was with a 'what the hell' smile that I entered the neon-lit space with mirrored ceilings just as the cops arrived to deal with an unruly inebriated couple who were refusing to pay their tab.  Featured in everything from CSI to Showgirls and featuring a 24/7 menu of everything from breakfasts and burgers onward to acclaimed nachos and desserts plus a setting quite unlike any other with drunken creatures of the night in all sorts of disarray it was clear on entering the space that it was I who was the novelty and requesting a table for one while using proper manners I was seated quickly, greeted immediately thereafter, and provided with superlative service throughout my 55 minute and 5 cup of coffee (plus one for the road) stay.  Certainly not 'gourmet' or 'artisan' but wholly satisfying for both 'dinner' and 'show' my order would consist of only two items and electing for the carrot cake as an appetizer while my main course was prepared I was happy to find a modest slice of high quality placed before me, the dense body not overly sweetened but instead nutty and aromatic with a thin layer of cream cheese icing adding a tangy sweetness without overwhelming - a balance I neither expected nor received with the decadent pile of custard-laden egg bread that followed complete with fresh fruits, whipped cream, and warm syrup...exactly the sort of thing I imagine I'd crave after a night of drinking...or after an early morning run...or when I was 8 years old...or 25 years later.

VSee profile site for full review with formatted pics.\u000a\u000a\u000aA fan of Chef Colicchio's simple approach to locally grown high end ingredients and a general appreciation of great food and "vegas-y" steakhouses I was very much looking forward to our experience at Craftsteak - so much so that we left the Los Angeles Kings game (my favorite team since age 5 and the reason we came to Vegas in the fist place) with 10 minutes to go in order to arrive for our 9:30 reservation.  I must say, in a weekend that included meals featuring the vision of Stratta, Keller, and Ducasse it was only Colicchio who failed to impress.\u000a \u000aFirst off, our waiter (Team #6, Cashier JR T) did not introduce himself for 15 minutes, actively avoiding eye contact when it was sought.  Thankfully the water and bread servers were on the ball.  When the waiter did introduce himself it was as though it was an epic hassle for him to explain the family style menu.  Additionally, though the MGM site lists $100 and $110 menus with chefs vs. personal selection, the waiter acted unaware of these entirely.  When he finally \u000adid concede that the site had these options, only the chefs choice was offered.....and stuck to.....without question.  \u000a \u000aWhile the online menu suggests three mains, three salads, three appetizers, three sides, and three desserts we were only offered the option of two appetizers with all other items to be selected for us.  When I attempted to order the scallops and the foie we were informed that both were out of stock.  Fair enough, the place was busy and my buddy already ordered his 10oz Filet cooked rare so I opted for the Yellowtail Tuna with olive and tomato cooked as rare as possible.  These choices made our waiter disappeared and we were brought the much hyped bread and butter.  While the bread was good, it certainly wasn't on par with the similar version served at Table 10 or Delmonico and the butter was rather cold.\u000a \u000aSalads arrived in a matter of minutes and consisted of the Butter Poached Diver Scallops with Fennel (I thought they were out?,) Satur Farm Mixed Lettuces with Olive Oil and Vinegar, Heirloom Tomatoes, and Prosciutto San Daniele.  Admittedly all dishes were good with the scallops and Heirloom tomatoes being particularly excellent.  The scallops were butter braised and lightly poached with a perfect sashimi-style inside and lightly crisp exterior.  The tomatoes were amongst the best I've ever tasted with a mild olive oil and balsamic marinade bringing out the acidic and sweet flavor of each of the 5+ varieties...as my buddy does not like tomatoes I was given the bulk of these lovely items and was greatful to oblige. \u000a \u000aSoon after the arrival of salads and appetizers we were brought our mains and sides which consisted of the aformentioned 10oz Fillet and Yellowfin Tuna with Olive and Tomato tapanade, Whipped Yukon gold potatoes, Mixed Mushooms (Lobster, Hen of Woods, Shiitake, Chanterelle) in Garlic, and Sweet White Corn.  As was the case last year in Vegas my buddy got me to try a piece of steak which he claimed was better than the Grade 12 A5 Waygu at Alex....it tasted merely like beef to me but he claimed it to be the best steak he'd ever tasted.  My tuna was quite excellent and cooked flawlessly with the interesting contrast of sweet tomatoes and bitter/briney olives forming an excellent medly of flavors.  Not the best yellowtail I've experienced, but certainly fantastic.  \u000a\u000aLike the mains and appetizers, the sides were delectable and featured a stockpile of woodsy mushrooms simply presented and delectable in taste - I was particularly thrilled to get such a large lobster mushroom as it lags behind only a morel as my favorite fungi.  The corn and potatoes were equally simple yet wonderful with the corn almost 'sugar-sweet' and the potatoes velvety, buttery, and wonderful.\u000a\u000aThe meal was slightly sabotaged here, once again, by our server who committed multiple mistakes.  Number one:  My friend ordered a half bottle of wine for $65.  Once again in his avoidance of us the waiter forgot (admitting this and apologizing later) until after appetizers were consumed and mains/sides delivered....and considering we were essentially rushed out the door by 11:15 (we received mains at 10:25) wine consumption was anything but leisurely.  Number two:  More bread was promised.....it was never delivered.  When sides were given and we were asked "is there anything else you would like?" I stated we'd like to try the Sweet Potatoes.....they were never delivered. Number three:  Well, read on...\u000a\u000aDessert was next and given my love for bread pudding and souffle (and the rave reviews I'd read of each) I specifically explained to my waiter, in great detail, that these were my favorites and that I'd heard good things about the versions at Craftsteak.  In response to my accolades the waiter simply noted "we do lots of great things" and proceeded to serve us NO bread pudding or Soufflé.

VBlog for full review of food - as this was a comped return visit I higlighted the service issues here.\u000a\u000aAs previously stated, after complaining to the GM (at that time a Mr. Jason Bartucci) with hopes that future visitors would not deal with such service we were provided a profound apology and an offer to refund the cost or to come back for a compensatory meal on the house - at the time I declined these options but on further review, a year after many fine dining experiences, I reconsidered.  In a city with so many great options I would not generally be the sort to 'forgive and forget,' but returning with my two friends - both who love steak - and remembering how good the food was I made contact with the restaurant through the MGM website.  While Mr. Bartucci (and our server) had apparently since been dismissed from the restaurant, my e-mail was answered by the new General Manager, Sebastien Vallet, who invited the three of us back for the chef's tasting with wine pairings on the house. \u000a\u000aTaking our seats we were almost instantly met by Mr. Vallet, a gregarious and friendly man in a great looking grey suit (vastly differing from the black/white clad servers,) who promised us a fantastic meal and confirmed that I did not eat beef while my friends most certainly did.  \u000a\u000aWithin moments our waters were filled - bottled water without even requesting, and our server and his assistant came to our table to once again confirm likes, dislikes, and anything we may need.  In order to not belabor service issues too much I will note a couple of issues here that, despite their obviously being overly attentive to our table, were less than impressive.  First, while Sebastien stopped by multiple times, our server spent vastly more time at a table of well clad businessmen while the assistant served as our primary server throughout.  While not "unfriendly" our assistant's grasp of the English language was poor at best, wines were not described as presented, and this was officially the only restaurant on my trip to Vegas where I had to fill my own water.  Another service issue presented itself later, but otherwise I have to say the team clearly "went out of their way" to please us - yet despite that fact, the service at Mastro's, CUT, Carnevino, and myriad other fine dining establishments vastly outpaced Craftsteak - their "average" being better than Craftsteak's "best."\u000a\u000aBrowsing around the restaurant I was amazed at how many hockey jerseys were present - clearly not the "business casual" Craftsteak desires.  Arriving from our assistant server without any description (approximately 1 minute later our main server showed up to tell us what the dishes were) our mains and sides were served with a red wine of which I'm unfamiliar and neither myself nor JT enjoyed - Brad thought it was decent.  Featuring mains of a 16oz Ribeye, a 12oz Skirt, and Divers Scallops with Fennel and sides of Yukon Gold Potatoes, Sweet Corn, and Wood Roasted Asparagus this is where the other service issue came up.  As previously noted, I don't eat steak - that doesn't mean my buddies do not eat scallops.  Featuring only five scallops (we received three of the exact same dish as an appetizer last visit) and my friends each deserving to try at least one I explained to our server that this wasn't acceptable and, surprisingly, met some resistance - apparently my thin frame made him think I can't eat.  Asking if any other fishes were available I was told only tuna - again the same prep I'd had last year (there was lobster, I saw it on another table, but clearly they weren't giving this away) and inquiring about birds or pork I was told only chicken (I know they had duck and pork loin, I saw the nightly menu) so I requested the chicken.  Consenting, begrudgingly, the server asked if we wanted anything else and I emphatically stated some mushrooms would be nice.  While it took about 15 minutes to prepare, the dishes were indeed brought by yet another server - someone who actually smiled (aside from Sebastien.)\u000a\u000aMyself - I was pleased with the food again, but still less than sold on the service given the fact that they were clearly "doing their best" and still seemed a little less than in-step with other restaurants of their caliber.  When it was all said and done Mr. Vallet stopped by to see how everything had been and I told him it was good - because it was.  It simply wasn't "great."  Leaving a nice tip for our service team (perhaps had they known we'd be leaving a good tip the primary server would've been more available) we made our way out of Craftsteak for the last time.  Impressed enough that I plan to check out Craft the next time I'm in Los Angeles or NYC, Vegas has plenty of other options in the meats market and if I were attending repeats I'd head to CUT or Carnevino first.

VSee profile site for full review with formatted pics.\u000a\u000a\u000aThomas Keller needs no introduction...he is without a doubt the reigning sovereign of American "haute-cuisine."  With attention to detail that is unmatched and an approach to cooking (both as an art and as a business) that is beautiful and elegant, expectations are and will always be high entering one of his establishments.  Having consumed ~$100 between two at Bouchon Bakery in NYC back in June, my expectations entering Bouchon Bistro on the 10th floor of the Venetian were high....at least 10 stories high.\u000a\u000aDue to their rustic simplicity and historic preparation by poor persons utilizing limited ingredients, I personally believe gnocchi/dumplings (along with Bread Pudding) to be the ultimate foods by which to judge a chef and knowing that my time in Vegas would be limited, I e-mailed ahead approximately 2 weeks early and asked if it would be possible for the chef to prepare the Gnocchi a la Parisienne during the weekday breakfast hours.  While an odd request for sure, my e-mail was almost immediately answered by General Manager Andy St. John who stated the chef would be delighted to prepare the meal during the day at no additional costs, no questions asked.  Gnocchi for breakfast?  Well, kinda...\u000a\u000aArriving at Bouchon around 7:30 I checked in with the host who introduced me to dining manager Robert who took me to my seat, indoors looking out at the pool given the bright sun and my fare skin.  Water was delivered and I was given a few moments to browse the restaurant before my server returned.  The simple bistro layout, the open doors to the pool and garden, the fresh smell of the baking breads....lovely.  When Robert returned specials were discussed, despite already knowing my strange request, and I settled on a starter of the Chocolate Almond Croissant and a cup (make that about 6 cups) of coffee.  See, the croissant was Breakfast...the Gnocchi just followed closely.\u000a\u000aThe croissant, like all of Keller's pastries, was magical...the best croissant I've ever had in terms of flavor.  Crispy and warm on the outside with chocolate drizzle and copious almonds, plus a flaky interior and a thick layer of chocolate gnache folded into the flaky dough and then loaded with chopped almonds.  If I lived close to a Bouchon this would be a very frequent indulgence to say the least.  The coffee...thick, robust, french pressed...the best priced cup of coffee in Vegas for sure.\u000a\u000aA couple more coffee refills and it was time for the main course (consumed with water, not coffee.)  Without further ado, I will just say that this dish redefined gnocchi in all ways.  Unlike Italian gnocchi, the French style utilized butter in the noodles along with the potatoes and the effect literally creates a dumpling that melts on the tongue.  Every single piece appeared hand crafted, perfectly tender on the outside, yet toothsome and textural on the outside.  The dish was complimented with carrots, spinach, mushrooms fricassee and beurre noisette as dressing and the entire effect was simply perfection on a plate.  I honestly cannot think of the last time it took me so long to savor each bite of a dish, but by all accounts I believe I ate each piece individually, slowly.  Such simple ingredients, such flawless execution.  \u000a\u000aCertainly I love foie gras, blue lobster, diver scallops, and desserts considered to be delicacies, but I also appreciate when simplicity yields perfection.  While I've not been to French Laundry or Per Se, both will have their time in the sun in the near future...but for now I will simply state that if it is the little things that count, Bouchon is doing ALL the little things right from superior service to setting to food.  After breakfast I made my second of four visits during the trip to Bouchon Bakery for a carry-along snack...two days later I returned to Bouchon for Brunch, my only repeat of the trip....yes, it was that impressive.

VSee profile site for full review with formatted pics.\u000a\u000a\u000aAs I am a very healthy eater approximately 29/30 days each month as part of my lifestyle, I haven't even experienced the 20 best restaurants in Columbus, my home city.  With that in mind, as a rule I generally don't revisit restaurants, especially when on vacation.   How is it that I found myself back at Bouchon only 2 days after my original experience you might ask?  Because dollar for dollar it is the best restaurant in Vegas.  It's the same reason I found myself at Bouchon Bakery four times in four days.  Call me obsessive if you like, I consider it a pursuit of perfection and as of yet I've not found anything in terms of food or service that Thomas Keller does less than perfect.\u000a\u000aArriving for Saturday brunch around 7:50am the night after dinner at Alex one might assume I was both happy and full...and difficult to impress.  One would be correct.  With those things in mind, the Buckeyes and Gophers game was starting at 9:00am and I was meeting friends at the Palazzo Sports Book so an early trip to Bouchon was ideal.  Seated outside I was once again greeted by the same fantastic service I received on trip one and was presented the specials including a phenomenal sounding Lobster gratin, Lorraine quiche, Strawberry croissant, and Cauliflower soup.  While the gratin was incredibly tempting the draw of the French toast bread pudding was simply too much this time around and my neighbors had the cinnamon beignets which appeared heavenly.  One French toast, one order of beignets, and a coffee please.\u000a\u000aUnlike the first time, for this meal I was started off with Keller's famous epi-baguettes which I first experienced in NYC back in June.  Still wonderfully crunchy on the outside and soft and buttery within and served with that sinful sweet butter and raspberry preserves the baguettes were gone by the time my beignets arrived.\u000a\u000aThe beignets, as expected, were incredible.  Having tried the custard and Raspberry filled versions at Bouchon Bakery the day before I opted for the donut-esque versions this time around which were served with a beautiful apricot jam and a pot of warm Nutella.  Light, airy, sweet, and still warm/glistening the beignets were much more than a "donut" and when dipped in the Nutella were even better than Ducasse's famous madelines from two nights prior.  Magical.  Losing myself in the morning sun, wonderful taste, and bold coffee I slowly indulged until all the jam and nutella was spent.\u000a\u000aPlates cleared and table dusted off for posterity, my coffee was refilled and returned along with the French Toast.  Smaller than expected, yet delicate in appearance I dug in slowly expecting to be amazed...and amazed I was.  While small, the taste was compact and potent with a creamy texture of butter cut by the texture of spiced apple and the fragrance of cinnamon.  Syrup was utilized sparingly, yet wonderfully to create a masterpiece without overpowering with sweetness.  While not a "true" bread pudding in the sense of the one served at Bouchon Bakery, this is my second favorite bread pudding ever behind only Nancy Olson's life-altering version at Gramercy Tavern.\u000a\u000aMeal finished I paid my bill and thanked my server for the wonderful meal.  All things being equal I would have returned for a late brunch around 2pm in order to check out the gratin or chicken and waffles, but after hanging out at the Sportsbook for a few others my buddy made other plans.  Oh well, at least I made my fourth and final stop at the Bakery on my way over to the Palazzo for some mid-game snacks.\u000a\u000aTwo meals in four days, four stops at the Bakery, and a previous visit to the NYC location back in June...certainly not normal for me...then again, there is nothing normal about Bouchon; it is fantastic.  With fellowship interviews coming up later this year I fully expect myself to wind up on both coasts for interviews...if schedules work out, a trip to French Laundry, Ad Hoc, and/or Per Se is almost a guarantee.  Until then, Thanksgiving will certainly feature the Bouchon Cookbook quite prominently.

VPretty much anyone who knows me realizes how I feel about Thomas Keller's approach to the culinary arts.  Truely a "chef's chef" I've always respected his desire to remain authentic, to not let his empire spread too far or too wide, and his strong dedication to the progression of America's culinary scene - donations to the Culinary Institute, working with the US Culinary Olympic team, etc.  Without overstating, though I still rank Alinea as my favorite meal of all time, I consider Keller my favorite chef.  Having been to each of Keller's restaurants except for Per Se in 2009 it was only logical that I make my way back to Bouchon for Saturday brunch on my most recent trip to Las Vegas - especially since it was only 2 floors away from my hotel room.\u000a\u000aArriving at the doors of Bouchon around 7:50 there was already a line of 8 people waiting and by the time the doors opened at 8:00 there were nearly 20.  Browsing the sign of specials I thought the crabcakes benedict sounded good, but not nearly as good as what I'd come for originally.  Making my way into the restaurant and meeting with the hostess I asked for a table for one outdoors if possible and was swiftly taken to the precise table I enjoyed the previous year.  Handed a menu to browse my coffee was filled (so much better than the coffee at the continental breakfast) and I was brought a water after declining a cocktail.\u000a \u000aReturning after a short time my server explained the specials and asked if I had any questions - stating no I placed my orders and requested some of the infamous epi-baguette to go with the house made butter and fresh preserves (strawberry this time) that were already on the table.  Receiving a "branch" of two pieces - and later two more - these wonderful pieces of carbohydrate reminded me again of just how good a simple baguette can be when using quality ingredients.  Creamy and grassy the butter went largely underutilized instead opting for the jam which displayed the very essence of strawberries and a small cup of nutella (an unexpected $2.50 surcharge.)\u000a\u000aBeginning the meal along with my second cup of coffee was a slice of Almond Brioche.  Served piping hot from the griddle the bread was buttery and sweet with perfectly toasted almonds contrasting well with the soft bread.  Similar to the brioche served with the foie gras terrine at The French Laundry (plus almonds) this was toast at its very best.\u000a\u000aMy main course, arriving with another refill of my coffee (yes, I have a caffeine problem) was the dish I knew I'd order the moment I decided to return to Bouchon - Keller's Chicken and Waffles.  Unobtainable at any other Thomas Keller restaurant (much like the French Toast Bread Pudding) the mere thought of this dish had me excited and it certainly didn't disappoint - better than Roscoe's, Crops, or Seldom Blues...by far.  The chicken, instead of being traditionally Southern fried was instead marinated in thyme and rosemary, then slow roasted for 13 hours and pan-flashed to crisp the skin.  Perfectly smooth, incredibly juicy, the chicken alone would have justified the trip.  Further enhancing the impressive plate were the waffles - four quartered pieces accented with buttermilk, bacon, chives, and (per the server) a bit of chicken stock.  Served alongside the main components of the dish was a delectable Tahitian vanilla bean butter, pure Vermont maple syrup, and sauce chasseur - essentially a gravy of chicken stock, bacon lardons, mushrooms, and onion.  A flawless array of crispy and soft, savory and sweet, nuanced and "in your face" - an absolutely lovely dish worth every penny of the $25 pricetag.\u000a\u000aSitting and sipping my coffee in the sun rising over the Venezia pools I couldn't help but think about other meals at Thomas Keller restaurants - honestly, aside from a stale cinnamon brioche (admittedly a flaw,) a piece of cheese (simply not my style,) and some spicy walnuts ( good, but not at that time in the meal) I've not yet had an item that was less than impressive - and many items were not just impressive, but formed the prototype for what I think that item is in its near-perfect form.  While service can sometimes be a tad "cool," or "stiff" it is always professional and the settings, ingredients, and experience uncompromisingly refined.  While I still have to try Verandah and Hash House a Go-Go to complete my "to do list" for breakfasts in Vegas, unless they truly wow I do believe I'll simply be frequenting Bouchon from now on when visiting the strip.

VFull review in Blog:\u000a\u000aThere are very few restaurants I feel compelled to return to again and again - the ones I do are genuinely mind blowing (Alinea,) cheap and kitschy (Griddle Café,) or...well, Bouchon Las Vegas.  Open for breakfast, brunch, and dinner I'd been to Chef Keller's Vegas Bistro on each of my previous three visits to Las Vegas and the opportunity to eat Christmas Brunch there with the three most important people in my life was simply too perfect and obvious a choice to pass up.  Having contacted the restaurant to be sure they'd be open on Christmas I was informed that they were indeed open but not taking reservations as is their Saturday Brunch policy - I was also told there would be "holiday themed" specials available.\u000a\u000aWaking early to be sure we'd arrive plenty early I have to admit I was a tad surprised when we were the first people in line at 7:45am, though we'd quickly be joined by twenty or so others before the doors opened with a pleasant Merry Christmas from the staff at exactly 8am.  Checking in at the hostess stand we were quickly whisked away to a great four-top near the windows overlooking the pools at the center of the Venezia tower and presented with menus.  With water poured the next person to visit our table would be our server, a pleasant young woman named Arlene who would live up to Bouchon's customary service - interested and forthcoming, knowledgable and efficient.  Describing the chalkboard specials (no "holiday themed" options to be found) and taking drink orders we were left to ponder our choices.\u000a\u000aWith two coffees, a tea, and orange juice served and refilled consistently (save for the orange juice) by the ever circling bussers we sat for mere moments before the ever-welcomed epi-baguette would arrive, this time with that same lovely butter and apricot preserves.\u000a\u000aStarting the meal proper and finally dining at Bouchon's brunch with a group I was this time able to order the pastry basket I'd previously held off on for fear that it would go to waste.  With four options to the basket plus one included with my aunt's Breakfast Americane the basket would actually be a silver platter with a blue cloth.  Featuring a cream cheese Danish, Pecan Sticky Bun, Orange Currant Scone, Chocolate Almond Croissant, and two Raspberry Beignets each taste was everything I've come to expect from Bouchon bakery and both the Cheese Danish and Orange Currant Scone were truly remarkable given the fact that I generally would not have ordered them at other restaurants.  Rumor has it that Keller is working on a Bouchon Bakery cookbook and this experience once again made me hope the rumors are true.\u000a\u000aFor my mother the choice would be a dish familiar to myself from two years prior; the bread pudding style French toast.  This time using D'anjou pears as opposed to the Bartletts from my visit but again with lovely layers of custard interspersed with cinnamon spiked compote of fruit between each layer there really isn't much that can be said about this dish that hasn't been praised before - a touch of maple syrup, a dust of confectioner's sugar to finish a truly decadent breakfast.  To temper the sweetness she also ordered a side of bacon - 7 thick strips of apple wood smoked Kurobuta pork for a mere $5.\u000a\u000aFor my sister, still feeling the effects of the gluttony at Picasso the night before, something light was desired and the decision was made to sample Keller's Waffle recipe.  Spiked with vanilla and so crispy on the exterior that I'd not be surprised if cornmeal was involved, the interior of the waffle was supple and spongy - textbook.  Topped with fresh bananas and chopped walnuts at a cost of $12 I can't say this was a cheap waffle, but all things considering it was light, tasty, and unfaultable.\u000a\u000aMy breakfast selection would be from the chalkboard.  Described merely as Oeuf du jour with Crab and Macaroni Gratin the dish itself would be served in a steaming hot low-ramekin.  Featuring tender macaroni intermingling with plump chunks of crab, gruyere, breadcrumbs, and butter at its base the dish was subsequently topped with two medium scrambled eggs and sauce Mornay with paprika and chives.  Creamy yet textural, slightly briny but sweet, and buttery beyond anything I've had in recent memory the dish was perhaps the best savory I've ever had for breakfast and the golden brioche served alongside harkened memories of Per Se and The French Laundry.\u000a\u000aWith plates cleaned our bussers would clear the table rapidly and Arlene would return with the check - no offer of dessert, just a "No Rush - Merry Christmas and thanks for having brunch with us today" as she handed us the check in a glass cup.  A tad annoyed at the lack of promised "holiday themed" specials we settled the tab and made our way to the door by 9:05 - a mere hour after we entered.  While certainly a good meal with great company this visit to Bouchon was a letdown largely due to heightened expectations.

VArriving in Vegas earlier in the day, I'd been awake for nearly 20 hours when I stepped into the Bellagio for my 7:30 reservation.  Tired but excited I walked in and mentioned I had a reservation for one to which the beautiful attendant stated "Ah yes, Dr. U, we've been expecting you."  At this point I was handed off to a team of fantastic servers who showed me to my window-side 4-top and the extravagance began.  I'll get my complaints out of the way early....there was a spot on the tablecloth approximately the size of match-head...no more complaints.  Perfect service, flawless timing, full descriptions, elaborate presentations, the gorgeous interior and fountain show outdoors....and a customized tasting menu as follows:\u000a\u000aAmuse Bouche:  Komomoto Oyster w/ American Caviar - I'm not an oyster guy, nor a Caviar guy, but the presentation was gorgeous and the flavors far more subdued than past tastes.  While I cannot say I'll ever appreciate these two items as much as other haute-cuisine, I can definitely say I'll look forward to my next unexpected encounter.\u000a\u000aBread Basket:  Pretzel, Walnut Olive, French Baguette w/ salted and unsalted butter.  The Baguette was crunchy and perfect for soaking up sauces, the pretzel crispy and salty outside and buttery soft inside, and the olive walnut simply sublime.  Better Pretzel than Mastros or Yankee Stadium, Better olive than Gramercy Tavern.  Runner up to Spago for best basket all time.  Better yet - After the first three courses I'd eaten one piece of each and went to grab another piece of Baguette for sauces when the waiter whisked it away and replaced it with a piping hot fresh basket stating "it isn't as good when it cools."\u000a\u000aCourse One:  Lobster Salad w/ avocado, frisee, hericot vert, black truffle - A Le Cirque classic and for very good reason.  Beautifully poached lobster over a puree of avocado and hericot verts, a layer or frisse, and a drizzle of black truffle dressing topped with a shaved black truffle.  Delicious as it was decadent, a beautiful way to start.  (note: the truffle was fresh and quite good, but certainly more for effect than taste....like plastic surgery on a super model....it was already great, but here is that extra unnecessary touch.)  \u000a\u000aCourse two:  Sauteed Foie Gras w/ microgreens, petite chestnuts, white peach, blackberry, cranberry - Sublime.  Fatty and flawless inside, just slightly crisp outside.  Served warm and sweet with a brilliant contrast against the tart berries, crispy peach, and crunchy nuts with the microgreens added for texture.  While not quite as innovative as the version at EMP, better in flavor.\u000a\u000aCourse three:  Crispy Sweet Breads w/ Fig and grape marmalade, veal reduction, butter basil foam, asparagus/heirloom tomato/mushroom salad - A substitution for the seasonal risotto and absolutely worth the decision.  A single sweetbread panflashed and crisp served beneath an airy butter and basil foam over a flavorful salad the dish was further enhanced by the addition of two smears of fig jelly that provided a sweet component to the already incredibly savory dish.  The veal reduction was poured in a small ring around the dish tableside and was my first experience with what the sous-chef could really do...until dishes four and five.\u000a\u000aCourse four:  Paupiette of Sea Bass with Pinot Noir sauce, crispy potato skin, microgreens and shredded savoy cabbage - Another Le Cirque classic and another winner in every way.  Perfectly poached bass with a crispy paper-thin skin served over a crispy salad and covered with a sauce that can only be described as heavenly.  Sweet and winelike yet bold and buttery, refined yet complex....more bread, please.\u000a\u000aCourse five:  Organic chicken w/ Foie gras macaroni, truffle, asparagus, tomato compote - My second substitution as I don't favor beef and a second wonderful choice.  Clean and tasty chicken with thin shavings of black tuffle beneath the crispy skin served over a layer of long handmade macaroni and a transcendent sauce of mushroom puree and foie gras.  Wonderfully crisp asparagus and a beautifully complex grilled tomato compote lent additional flavors to the dish, as well.\u000a\u000aPalate Cleanser:  Tequila Sorbet with gold leaf, dragon fruit, dinosaur plum, coconut milk, and edible bowl - More pineapple than tequila, this sorbet was divine and a mere sign of things to come.  The fruit compote was delectable and the coconut milk wonderful for offsetting the citrus.  I'd like to say I knew the bowl was edible, but initially when I broke it I was worried....I think this was expected as my server then stepped in to suggest I "try a bite."  The gold leaf....we'll chalk that up to extravagance, it had no flavor.\u000a\u000aSee profile site for full review with formatted pics.

VItems Selected:\u000aCoffee\u000aSticky Fingers - Cinnamon Roll with Bacon and Maple Glaze\u000aOver the Top Blueberry Muffin - Streusel, Blueberries\u000aCorn Flake Crusted French Toast with Vanilla Butter, Maple Syrup, Mascarpone, Strawberry\u000aChicken and Waffles with spiced maple syrup\u000a \u000aWith my mother in town for one more day and having not yet visited the strip once during the subsequent week it was a bit of a surprise that she mentioned wanting to see Hard Rock during her visit but having long been eyeing 24-hour dining spot Mr. Lucky's an early morning plan was put in motion, us navigating the casino just prior to 7am while disheveled men and women in various states of sleeplessness and inebriation made their way back to their rooms.  A large, open space without a whole lot of character but people watching aplenty both in the open kitchen and on the gaming floor it would be mere moments after our arrival that we were seated and only seconds more before coffee refills began in earnest to accompany a breakfast our friendly waiter claimed was 'too much' for a duo; words I'd later make him eat as I casually passed the empty, stacked plates to the edge of the table and requested a cup of coffee for the road.  Clearly the sort of restaurant where subtlety yields to gluttony it was largely a desire to sample more items that led to us taking a pass on the infamous "Fat Elvis," instead ordering a quartet of items beginning with decent, if not particularly memorable chicken over waffles and a buttery blueberry muffin before moving onto things far superior, the first a stack of golden French toast soaked with custard but crisped by cornflakes and loaded with fresh berries plus mascarpone and the second, quite literally, a flaky "turntable-sized" cinnamon roll rife with butter, cinnamon, and bacon that rivals the best I've found and will invariably be ordered again just as soon as I find someone to go back with me to tackle that signature stack of 14 bacon and banana pancakes.

VOne of the better buffets in Vegas with a wide variety of food, quality fresh baked goods, and solid/well prepared seafood options.  Good desserts as well.   Certainly not as good as Paris, but a solid second tier option for those looking to eat a ton.\u000a\u000aService was excellent and the line was short, so that was a plus, as well.\u000a\u000aA bit pricey, but you get what you pay for.  See pics.\u000a\u000aHighly recommend the stuffed french toast w/ Hazelnuts and Banana!

VThe quality is incredible.\u000aThe prices are high.\u000aThe service is snooty.\u000a\u000aAdmittedly this is one of the prettiest restaurants that I have ever eaten in and the fact that I didn't pay is another huge bonus.  With that said, however, despite not being a man with a huge appetite, I consumed bread, entree, and a dessert and was nowhere near full despite my own check coming in at close to $85 (Langostinos and Cheesecake.)\u000a\u000aThere are better options in Vegas for the money, although perhaps not places with fresher fish.  I have heard that the restaurant has improved greatly since my visit in 2005 and am debating a return, but after watching Mario beat Mr. Bartolotta on Iron Chef, perhaps I'd be better off rekindling my love with Mr Batalli at B+B.

VDear KA, thank you for replacing the scene where the unfortunate performer lost her life with a 16-bit video game montage that lasted for nearly twenty minutes without lowering the price of your production by a cent.  Certainly not my 'style' of performance it was as a gift to my mother and aunt during their visit that we attended the show at The MGM and truly impressed by the athleticism throughout the show along with the costumes I cannot say the storyline did much for me at all.  Admittedly awe-struck by much of the show and the acrobatics suffice it to say that any semblance 'wow' factor was completely undermined by the lackluster penultimate scene and although I was unlikely to ever pay for a Cirque performance again even before that it is a veritable guarantee that I'll not do so again now.

VFull review in blog:  Notes on their degustation.\u000a\u000aArriving as we sipped our drinks the nightly amuse would be Cold Smoked Scottish Salmon, Caviar, Cucumber, Quail Egg, Crème Fraiche, and Potato Leek Soup.  Served curled around the crème fraiche the salmon was excellent - more firm than a sashimi prep, but similar in taste.  With the caviar somewhat less briny than others I've tasted it worked well with the somewhat sour crème while the egg added its characteristic creamy flavor.  The Potato soup was a commendable potage - the creamy texture balanced nicely with the onions and chives.\u000a\u000aWith myself ordering the 5-course degustation, largely unchanged over many years at Picasso, and Erika opting to go Prix Fixe for more choices our first courses would arrive simultaneously.  For my first dish, Maine Lobster Salad - Apple-Champagne Vinaigrette was ample in portion, elegant in presentation, and lovely on the palate.  With thick chunks of chilled lobster in a light cream sauce serving as the base, the "salad" was essentially microgreens tossed with apple-cider accented vinaigrette atop.  Flanked by melon balls and tomatoes of varying colors the dish was quite light, a wonderful opening volley even if it was much more "lobster" than "salad."\u000a\u000aCourse two was a Pan Seared U-10 Day Boat Scallop with Potato Mousseline and Jus de Veau.  Served with a potato crisp standing playfully behind the single monstrous scallop the dish looked beautiful and the tastes were lovely, albeit predictable with the savory veal reduction balancing the sweet scallop.  With the creamy potato puree loaded with butter the place where this dish missed was in the centerpiece - gorgeously caramelized to the point of a near brulee on the exterior the scallop was simply a bit too well done at its center.  While certainly a competent and lovely preparation the fact remains that perhaps twenty less seconds on the pan could have elevated it to a whole different level.\u000a\u000aThe next course would provide my sister with an empty charger while I would receive the Sautéed "A" Steak of Foie Gras with Poached Pears, Huckleberries, Crushed Pistachios, Lemon Zest, and Rhubarb.  A large steak of 3-4 ounces of high quality and perfectly cleaned Foie Gras, the liver itself was everything you would expect.  Placed atop a "cake" of compressed pistachio and topped with roasted crunchy pistachios kissed with lemon the textures were a nice contrast and exceptionally complimentary.  Swirled with rhubarb reduction and plated alongside a poached pear with huckleberries this dish did not attempt to reinvent the wheel, but it was quite memorable for its classic approach.\u000a\u000aThe main course was Roasted Lamb Chops with Sweet Bell Pepper Farci turned out to be quite the substantial portion - easily 7-8oz including the bone.  Prepared rare and extremely juicy yet easily cut with the side of the fork this was without a doubt a top-5 all time lamb preparation.  Presented simply with rosemary, a stack of buttery potatoes, and a mélange of sweet bell peppers this would prove my favorite dish of the evening, regardless of how good the Foie Gras was.\u000a\u000aHazelnut and Coffee Opera with Coffee Hazelnut Ice Cream and Brown Sugar Filberts was quite impressive in presentation.  With a thin wedge of moist cake served on edge with a "shadow" of Hazelnut dust the flavor and texture of the cake was somewhere between almond dacquoise and tiramisu.  Resting happily next to the tall and proud cake, a small ball of similarly flavored ice cream atop candied nuts - creamy and crunchy, a nice cake and ice cream combination but certainly nothing to write home about.\u000a\u000aMaking our way from Picasso I must say I left with mixed emotions - not because anything was bad - as a matter of fact, everything was quite good.  The issue was that aside from a lovely Christmas Eve with my little sister at a restaurant that seemed unattainable a mere 8 years ago, nothing was "great" aside from the décor and art.  In the end I think Picasso has maintained its place in the Vegas culinary scene - it is just that many other restaurants, and my own personal dining preferences, have perhaps grown to be something more.

Somewhat brasserie in design with gold garnish and heavy fabrics plus a "patio" on the casino floor it was moments to seven on a Saturday morning that our trio was seated overlooking the Venetian's lingering late-night revelers alongside the morning check-outs and with immense menus soon perused selections were made - a sweet and gluttonous affair slow to arrive and marred by slow refills as staff seemed to be idling into shift change.  Admittedly more than a little puckish when plates were delivered nearly forty-five minutes later it was with relieved but bemused smiles that the three of us first laid eyes on the constituents of our $80 affair and although what was ordered would have been better suited for a half-dozen, the majority of it was worth the wait - an aggressively spiced carrot cake loaded with nuts plus shredded coconut and some of the thickest custard-drenched French Toast I've found both amongst the city's best.

VFor its prices, Neros is possibly the best Steakhouse for the money in Vegas.  High quality meats, great side dishes, wonderfully tasty desserts, and the best bread basket I have ever tasted.  \u000a\u000aAs someone who samples the Lobster Bisque anywhere he goes, I must say that the version at Neros is amongst my alltime favorites with a delicate touch of terragon creme that balances everything perfectly.  Additionally, the Alaskan King Salmon Tournedos were flawless, fresh, perfectly seared, and delicious.....and about 1/2 the price as the same amount of meat as Bartolotta at the Wynn.  The creamed spinach was also tasty, but it is unfortunate that the gnocchi was quite subpar (so-much-so that they've apparently removed it from the menu.)\u000a\u000aBack to the bread bowl for a second......seriously.....the walnut raisin bread alone would nearly be enough for me to return.  The Chocolate Fondue with fresh figs and poundcake was also quite delicious, but there was not nearly enough fruit/cake to utilize all the chocolate.\u000a\u000aService was unpretentious and pleasant, though I must admit they snuck in the Voss water without asking about table/tap water......a nasty $30 suprise in water at the end of the meal.  \u000a\u000aAll told, a good experience, but not on par with Mastro's further West (my favorite steakhouse I've yet encountered.)

VFree entry, walking distance from my clinic, and a veritable deal on games prominent in my childhood memories.  Pair that with a friendly staff and a schedule frequently beleaguered by no shows and I see this place playing prominently into extended lunch hours.

VExchanging our humorous Christmas gag-gifts and packing our bags for the Christmas flight home we next checked out of our hotel and left our bags in the rental car while we decided to finish our vacation with some gaming, coffee, and dessert in the early afternoon at Aria.    Having already browsed the newest Jean-Philippe boutique multiple times during our visit and having tried the original at Bellagio in the past we were thrilled to note that as opposed to Bouchon, Jean Philippe was fully embracing the holiday theme.\u000a\u000aHaving experienced the Nutella gelato and Tiramisu on past visits to Jean Philippe at the Bellagio I personally was wowed by the vastness of the new shop's selection - from cookies to candies to confections and ice cream everything looked excellent and given the length of the line we were given plenty of time to decide.  With the space at Aria including a dining area in addition to the vast shop my mother and sister made their suggestions and went to wait out a table - a successful bid that would land us a four-top overlooking the gaming floor only moments before we paid our bill.\u000a\u000aBrowsing the selection and deciding on a dessert each, plus an enormous chocolate covered strawberry and a coffee the items were plated on clear plastic trays with the Chef's signature logo - a nice touch softening the blow of a $38 tab.  Splitting each item into fourths in order to design a miniature dessert tasting our selections would be a "gift wrapped" Carrot cake, a Nutella Brioche, a Snowman Tiramisu, and a Chocolate Bouche de Noel.  \u000a\u000aWith each item a stunning example of Jean Philippe and team's handiwork I still think this is one of the best Tiramisu dishes to ever grace my palate and the Bouche was vastly superior to that at Bouchon Bakery just days before.  With the Carrot Cake loaded with a citrus toned cream cheese, raisins, and plenty of texture and the Nutella Brioche featuring the texture of a Croissant with easily two tablespoons of the Hazelnut filling within everything was divine, especially when paired with the subtly chocolate toned coffee.  A sweet ending to a wonderful trip - and my first Merry Christmas outside of the Buckeye State.

VChocolates ordered include Canelle, Rustic, Crunchy, Earl Grey, Gringo, Tahiti, Piemont, Caramel\u000a\u000a...suffice it to say that neither time nor a second location has diminished the quality of Jean Phillippe Patisserie, a second visit to the larger Aria location proving every bit as good as the first as I shared eight varieties of chocolate presented in a jewel-box display with a friend.  From the bright aromatics of the cinnamon Canelle to the simple pairing of chocolate and salted caramel each of the two-bite squares was beautifully crafted with subtle nuances and with well sourced pure-bean chocolates both dark and milk providing the backbone every flavor and texture proved remarkable; the coffee spiked Gringo and rum soaked Tahiti my personal favorites, and all the better enjoyed at the restaurant's counter overlooking the casino floor and the scene that is Sin City on Saturday night.

VFull review in Blog.\u000a\u000aReally, I imagine that if anyone would know what a Country Club should look like it is probably Steve Wynn....either him or Jack Nicklaus.  Calling ahead for reservations for three we were told they were mostly booked but had a four-top available at 1:30. Standing up and walking to the windows I looked out over the amazing 18 holes of greenery that Mr. Wynn had built in the middle of the desert - quite possibly the most impressive "architecture" in the Wynn empire.\u000a\u000aWe made our way to our table and were met by our witty and surprisingly down-to-earth and casual server.  Explaining some of the daily specials while handing us our menus the waiter quipped about his favorite dishes, the design of the restaurant, Chef Guia's culinary pedigree, and the multiple celebrities who'd sat in our very seats - Bill Murray and Michael Jordan to name a few.  While clearly intending to impress I actually found our waiter to be a pretty genuine individual throughout our meal - something a bit different for "Wynn service" which is normally a bit starchy and unapproachable.  \u000a \u000aSitting and chatting for a little while we were soon brought refills of our waters and diet cokes and a large basket of bread - fresh from the oven.  Served with a soft and fragrant butter the bread itself was almost a cross between a brioche in density and a soda bread in texture.  With a lovely crunchy crust giving way to a soft and buttery center we devoured the first basket before our appetizers even arrived and ended up finishing a second basket before the mains were completed.  \u000a\u000aFor Matt and myself why not get a sweet for one course and a savory for the other?  For an appetizer, the French Toast Bread Pudding with Vermont Maple Syrup, Berries, Candied Pecans, Glazed Bacon - essentially two large English-muffin sized pieces of custard laden and smooth maple bread pudding stacked and surrounded with fresh berries and candied pecans - then topped with a slice of thick and perfect maple glazed bacon.  Honestly - no offense to Thomas Keller's similar option at Bouchon - but this was better.  A mélange of vanilla and maple, cinnamon and butter, and crispy exterior yielding a custard-like interior - it could've been breakfast, it could've been dessert - and it was one heck of an appetizer.\u000a\u000aAfter a wait, more talk, more fries, and more coffee our mains arrived.  For myself, Two large organic poached eggs with BBQ Smoked Pork, Bacon Cheese Muffins, and Charred Green Chile Hollandaise.  Somewhat "Tex Mex" but also at the same time as refined as a traditional Benedict it is hard to say what aspect of this dish was most appealing - the maple-heavy pulled pork, the creamy poached eggs, the spicy hollandaise with only mild hints of sour, or those indelible English muffins.  Rupturing the eggs and allowed the dish to flood with a combination of creamy and spicy, sweet and savory I have to say the result wasn't as pretty as the presentation, but the flavor was fantastic.\u000a\u000aFor dessert our waiter recommedned the Bombolone for dessert and stated it was one of his five favorite dishes in Vegas.  Taking him on his word I agreed and approximately 15 minutes later the dishes arrived.  Entitled Chocolate Bombolone with Brioche Donuts, Berries, Creme Anglaise, and Chocolate Sauce the dish was simple - five 72% dark chocolate truffles dipped in brioche batter and deep fried only long enough to brown the outside and liquefy the center paired with a smooth vanilla anglaise, fresh berries, and a hefty dark chocolate sauce.  What the dish lacked in complexity, however, it more than made up for in flavor.  Instructed to place the whole bite into my mouth before chewing each bite simply burst forth with chocolate on masticating.  Small in portion the richness of the chocolate was a perfect way to end a great meal and any more would have likely been too decadent to finish.\u000a\u000aSitting and chatting for another half hour before our departure our drinks were continually refilled and our server occasionally stopped by to be sure all was well.  Never rushed as it was the end of the brunch service I was impressed at how laid back such a refined restaurant felt - it really did feel like a "member's only" club where people were welcome to socialize as long as they like.  Very happy with the meal and the uncharacteristically casual feel of a Wynn-core enterprise I have to say that aside from Bouchon, the Country Club may be my favorite mid-day meal in Las Vegas.  A great view, great service, great company, and most importantly - great food - definitely a meal worth a day away from Bouchon's breakfast.

VTwo beautiful young women simultaneously open the large wooden doors, one offering welcome and the other offering to take a picture;  this is how dinner began at Alex.  Entering the opulent dining room two more greeters appeared, one checking the reservation and the other escorting us down the staircase to our seats.  Arriving at our seats, another two individuals appeared, one to check my coat upstairs, the other to assist us with our chairs.  Water - crystal or sparkling?  Crystal.  "Very good, doctor."  To be fair, this meal was months in planning and my friend and I were upgraded to "VIP" status by a friend at the restaurant, but regardless of that fact the stellar service was above and beyond what was expected.\u000a\u000aMenus were received along with a wine list and approximately 5 minutes later the first course of canapes arrived from the kitchen.  As we browsed the menu and debated the stellar tasting vs. the incredible list of ingredients on the prix fixe the experience began with a scallop chip piled with otoro and caviar, a Berkshire bacon wrapped Granny Smith apple, roasted heirloom pepper soup, and a gruyere cheese puff.  While all four were absolutely sublime, particular favorites were the otoro and caviar with its fatty salty balance and crispy chip as well as the gruyere cheese puff which literally melted on the tongue and clung to the palate.\u000a\u000aAfter much perusal and debate, selections were made and the somellier stopped by to chat with my friend about wine pairings for the choices.  When my buddy admitted his naievety the somm, not pretentious in the least, suggested it was okay since he "just made it up as he went along."  Two wines were selected by the somm and my friend stated both were excellent, albeit $30+/glass.  After orders were taken, course two of canapes arrived including a Cucumber and salmon bouche,  Carrot and spicey ginger soup, a king crab BLT, and a torchon du Foie Gras with apricot and pistaccio.  Once again, all choices were explosive and dynamic with the carrot soup and its heavily layered flavors as well as the Foie presenting most prominently.  The foie was so good that it almost made me wish I'd selected it as an apetizer....almost.\u000a\u000aBreads and sweet butter next appeared consisting of four types served by our attendant.  Choices included Orange Rosemary Ciabatta, Buckwheat, Toasted Corn Bread, and Cranberry Sunflower seed.  Each selection was tried once with an additional slice of cranberry sunflower seed selected with my main and all were superb with their crunchy crust and moist/dense substance inside.  Just after bread, a final amuse arrived in the form of a Kampachi Rillet with raddish, daikon, and savoy cabbage slaw topped with lotus root over balsamic - creamy, sweet, acidic, and beautiful.\u000a\u000aFor course one I selected the European blue lobster with Savoy Cabbage and Coral-Verbena Sauce while my friend chose the Napoleon of King Crab w/ Sweet Carrot Sauce, Jicama, Fuji Apple and Avocado.  Given the rarity of blue lobster, I simply could not resist the opportunity and honestly it may have been the best dish I have ever tasted.  More textured and sweet than its Maine counterpart, the butter poached tail rested atop whole claw similarly poached and wrapped in cabbage.  The whole presentation was then drizzled with an incredibly creamy yet savory sauce with a hint of vanilla.  It was mesmerizing.  \u000a\u000aWhile I cannot comment on the flavor of my friend's dishes, he claimed that the apple was the predominant flavor and secondarily the crab.  Regardless, it was beautifully presented and quite large in portion.  \u000a\u000aAs part of our 'VIP' status we were next provided a second appetizer on the house, my friend receiving the Parmigiano Risotto w/ Roasted Porcini Mushrooms and Crispy Chicken Oysters and myself lucky enough to receive the Veal Sweetbread Piccata with Roasted Porcini Mushrooms, Parmigiano, Arugula.  While I missed the sweet component of other presentations, my dish was fantastic with two large pan-seared and crispy sweetbreads along side two enormous Porcinis and atop Arugula with shaved Parmigiano on top.  My friend's dish which he graciously allowed me to taste was incredible with a level of creaminess almost unfathomable and a texture of silky perfection offset only by the woodsy mushrooms and crunchy chicken.\u000a\u000aSee profile site for full review with formatted pics.

VItems Selected:\u000aMaine Lobster Benedict - Poached Eggs, Lobster, Roasted Corn, Asparagus, Bacon Waffles, Béarnaise, Skillet Red Potatoes\u000aChicken and Waffles - two fried chicken breasts, poached egg, bacon-scallion waffle, spiced maple syrup\u000aRed Velvet Pancakes - White Chocolate Shavings, Chocolate Chip Nibs, Vanilla Cream Glaze\u000aCaptain Crunch Coated Brioche French Toast - Salted Buttered Pecans, Caramelized Banana, Toffee, Maple Syrup\u000a\u000aLocated in The Wynn overlooking the resort's lush gardens and pools Terrace Point Café had long been on my breakfast 'to-do' list and with a Saturday morning meeting behind me our 9:00am arrival found myself and a friend squarely in the middle of the restaurant's morning bustle, a friendly but overburdened server named Hector providing service for the subsequent two hours.  Open for breakfast and lunch featuring a well culled 'all-day' menu of novel takes on staples from each it was with minimal delay that options were perused and opting for one course savory and a second sweet it would not be long before plates arrived, each surprisingly well portioned and pristinely prepared to justify an admittedly high tariff.  Beginning with butter-poached lobster atop savory waffles and a bed of fresh vegetables liberally topped with creamy béarnaise alongside two crispy fried chicken breasts stacked amidst supple waffles crowned with an egg and Crystal infused maple syrup suffice it to say that both ingredient sourcing and preparation  technique proved every bit worthy of Steve Wynn's reputation and yet as good as these were the sweets that followed were even better, the crunch-yields-custard French Toast among the nation's best even before adding pure maple syrup while the mountain of fluffy pancakes sandwiching layers of vanilla tinged cream cheese resembled a true Red Velvet cake big enough to share...amongst four.

VItems Selected:\u000aMagic Cookie Bar - Coconut, Caramel, Shortbread, Chocolate, Pretzels\u000aAlmond Croissant\u000aFrosted Cinnamon Roll\u000a\u000aAfter a truly an enjoyable breakfast bathed in the warm sunshine of immense windows and high ceilings it was admittedly with some regret that we neglected to taste any of Terrace Point's pastries but returning later that day after a bit of Fashion Show shopping I opted to make amends at grab-and-go sister, Drugstore Café - a trio of three items proving equally competent to that served in the dining room with both a decadent brioche cinnamon roll and rich "magic" cookie bar proving delicious and slightly superior to the twice-baked almond croissant; a shattering shell and great texture marred by just a bit too much sweet frangipane; a good choice for the strip but a far cry from Bonjour or Sugar Bee's for city's best.

VArriving early I was told I could take a seat inside while my table was prepared.  Sitting down in the bar area I was instantly glad I'd made a reservation - possibly the busiest restaurant I saw during my whole trip to Vegas the average wait for a party of 2 was 30 minutes!  After approximately 5 minutes I was led to my table - a small two-top at the edge of the main dining room and thankfully somewhat isolated by the intensely loud interior of the restaurant.  Greeted by my seemingly overworked server I was asked if I wanted wine and when I declined she simply disappeared for approximately ten minutes, a theme of absence that would recur frequently during the meal.\u000a \u000aEventually returning to take my order and fill my water glass I had spent plenty of time browsing the unique Cali-French cuisine of Chef Eric Lhuillier and when I asked regarding the foie gras on the dinner menu I was told that the chef would be glad to prepare it - placing my orders I was left to wait - again for an excessive amount of time. Thankfully in my server's absence another young man took the onus to attend to my water glass while another well dressed server brought me a couple of fantastic dinner rolls.  Served with small chunks of cold and unsalted butter the rolls were served piping hot from the oven and had a great ratio of crusty salted exterior to soft and airy interior - they were actually so buttery sweet that adding the table butter was entirely unnecessary.  Being sure not to overfill like the prior day I limited myself to only two pieces of bread and plenty of water while I waited.\u000a \u000aArriving literally after the table across from myself had ordered, eaten, paid and departed, my first dish was indeed my special request from the dinner menu - and while there was nothing special about the service at this meal, the dish continued a theme of quite exceptional food that was started by the rolls.  Described as "Chaud froid of seared foie gras - Pickled pineapple and heirloom radishes" the dish was actually presented as a large pile of artisan greens and shredded radishes with great snap and pieces of duck confit intermixed over the top of two medium sized lobes of warm seared foie atop a chunk of incredibly tart yet savory pineapple.  While clearly following a formula of balancing the unctuous foie with the sweet components of fruit and adding greens for texture I actually loved this preparation for the pickled pineapple and the manner in which the acid mingled with the foie.  The foie itself, while good, notably did have a couple of small veins that clearly would not have "made the cut" at a higher end restaurant - regardless, for an item not regularly prepared at lunch it was quite nice.\u000a \u000aFinishing my foie the plate was left on the table for some time (the table across from me still sat uncleaned as well) before my main course arrived - and even after delivery of my dish the empty plate remained.  Service issues aside, the food once again impressed - this time a classic Croque Monsieur served with crispy garlic frites and a small salad with oil and vinegar.  Not usually a fan of fries I will say these were superb - the best I'd had since those at Bouchon with their Croque, actually.  Served with gruyere and crème fraiche as opposed to the more traditional Mornay or Bechamel sauce I have to admit I liked the "tang" from the creme and the combination of the buttery brioche, savory cheese, and well prepared ham made for an excellent sandwich - not as good as some, but vastly better than others - and something "different" than the norm.\u000a \u000aHappy with the food thus far I knew dessert was a must - it was just a matter of deciding on one.  With balsamic strawberries, apple tart tatin, and souffle there were so many options - but clearly the bread pudding stated to be Chef Splichal's signature was the obvious choice.  Beginning with a buttery and rich croissant the dish was bound with a thick vanilla custard and studded with rich chunks of dark chocolate forming pockets within the admixture.  Delicious on its own the square of cake-like pudding was topped with a sweet strawberry and accompanied by a small vessel of buttery bourbon creme that only served to enhance the sweetness of the dish while accenting the subtle notes of the chocolate and vanilla expertly.  While not as "fancy" as a souffle, definitely a worthy "signature" dessert.\u000a \u000aFinishing another glass of water I paid the bill - nearly $50 for lunch - and left a modest tip.  While I fully admit that I'm a bit choosy when it comes to my service there is nothing worse than a chef's vision being compromised by the front of the house.  While the food wasn't as amazing as many places in Vegas and the service could certainly stand to take some lessons from Keller's team at Bouchon I'd consider a return visit in the future if Vegas didn't have so many other great options.\u000a\u000aBlog for full review w/ pics.

VThis Maggiano's, like all the others, is what it is....but a little bit better given the excellent viewpoint from the fashion show mall out onto the strip.  Went here with 12 people and had wonderful time despite the mediocre food.  Like all chains, the menu is formulaic and there are hits and misses.  \u000a\u000aHits include the super garlicy Shrimp Oreganata, Garlic Shrimp Linguine, and Lobster Ravioli.  Needless to say, they do garlic right.  The tiramisu was also quite tasty and enormous (not that this matters much since Maggiano's is all you can eat)\u000a\u000aMisses included a mediocre (actually pretty bad) gnocchi, oily and limp Eggplant Parmesan, and cheesecake that was heavy and flavorless.\u000a\u000aI last went t this Maggiano's back in 2005 and can't say I'd recommend it for 'fine dining,' but in terms of bang-for-your-buck in Las Vegas it is certainly a valid option.\u000a\u000a2 Stars for the food, 4 for a good time atomsphere with a big group.  Its closer to a 2.5 than a 3, but I'll round up for good memories.

VHaving experienced such great food at the grocery and pizzeria a trip down 40th street to LGO Hospitality's proper restaurant - Chelsea's Kitchen - would prove to be much of the same and with brunch service starting at 9:30am I arrived just a few minutes after the doors opened to find the patio already partially filled as the warm sun and late October breeze filtered through the space.   A large restaurant with an enormous open kitchen, plenty of seating, and vastly more parking than the grocery I'd heard some mixed things about Chelsea's but with the same high standards of food, service, and setting I really enjoyed my visit - though perhaps not QUITE as much as my frequent stops down the street.\u000a\u000aHotcakes:  Having asked my server, Jenna, if I could order the children's hotcakes as a side dish to my main course I was instead offered the option of an individual cake for $2 (as opposed to the children's $6) and happy to take her up on the offer the hotcake turned out to be light, fluffy, and golden brown; perhaps not the most exciting option on the menu but a textbook example of how a pancake should be done - particularly when paired with high quality pure maple syrup.\u000a\u000aDixie Pan-Fried Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Grilled Vegetables:  The main reason I visited Chelsea's on the day that I did was because I was going to noca for the Fried Chicken showdown that evening - what better way to prepare for fried chicken than with fried chicken?  With that noted, the comparison between the bird from Chelsea's and that of noca, fnb, or any other are a little bit difficult because of the style of preparation, but all things being equal what I really enjoyed about the chicken at Chelsea's was the moisture content of the meat and comparatively light breading overlying the well brined bird.  Crisp and savory with just a bit of spice further enhanced by the peppery potatoes this was down home comfort food - like the hotcakes nothing fancy, just well-made with superior ingredients, though I will say the mashed potatoes and vegetables could have used a bit more salt...and the chicken was even better with a drizzle of the leftover maple syrup from the hotcakes.\u000a\u000aRed Velvet Cake with Butter Pecan Gelato from Grateful Spoon and Fresh Mint:  A thick slice of LGO's classic cake served with a scoop of butter pecan gelato from Grateful Spoon and a mint leaf - much like my meal at Lo-Lo's it wouldn't have seemed right to end a breakfast of fried chicken without a slice of red velvet and while I still prefer the version at Lo-Lo's overall it is only by the slimmest of margins and based entirely on a personal preference for a sweeter frosting, something La Grande Orange shies away from, instead focusing on the slightly sour notes to help temper the otherwise dense chocolate cake.  Six of one, half dozen of the other - and the gelato was excellent, though more butter than pecan, and definitely upping the dish's sweetness factor but a significant degree.\u000a\u000aA great room and a lovely patio with professional service and fresh, natural, and delicious food I'm sure I'll find myself back a Chelsea's Kitchen soon - but likely not before a good dozen additional visits to the grocery and pizzeria.

VBeginning the day as I do most, with a morning run well before the sun is up, the first stop on this 6-stop tour would be downtown - a place I've now discovered to be devoid of most signs of human life on a Saturday...except for a small parcel of land at 801 North 1st Street entitled "Matt's Big Breakfast" where a line of thirty or so was already waiting for the approximately 20 seats inside.  Having heard of the nearly decade old establishment owned and operated by Matt Pool during my first visit to Phoenix but unable to make it downtown before ten on any day during that trip (when lines reportedly top two hours despite triple digit temperatures) I have to admit that I really had not anticipated the line to be so long at 6:55am and for a moment I contemplated heading elsewhere, but with my books in hand and nothing better to do my curiosity won out and I added my name to the paper list and took a seat in the rapidly dissipating shade.\u000a\u000aSitting and reading while a pair of ASU students talked about having seen Matt's on (presumably a repeat) of Diners, Dives, and Drive-Ins the previous night I tried to ignore them (and Guy Fiere's existence in general) while a few people trickled out of the restaurant and with my name at least ten parties down on the list I was surprised when it was called - the solo diner benefit, it seems, landing me an end seat on the counter only fifteen minutes after I arrived and given the expedient service at Matt's a fortuitous happening that had me leaving the restaurant before the aforementioned students had even entered the doors.\u000a\u000aSeated at the counter with a menu I'd already memorized in hand and a daily special that held little interest I perused the interior - small, stark, but efficient and exceptionally clean - before my server filled my water glass, offered me coffee, and fielded a pair of questions prior to taking my order and handing it over to the kitchen less than five feet away.  With the space tight and my location literally on the verge of the kitchen and the pass it would not be long before my coffee was filled - a single pour that I subsequently sent back due to a combination of thin mouth-feel, acrid flavor, and no artificial sweetener - and even less time before my stool would be bumped into for the first of thirty times...to say the least this is not a place I'd choose to linger.\u000a\u000aSeated and watching the action of the kitchen as plate after plate came through the window and regular after regular chatted with Matt's wife at the cash register it would not be long before my order would arrive and with the restaurant's strong dedication to local/organic/fresh sourcing the items that were presented quickly made me realize why so many people deal with long waits and less-than-comfortable seating to experience Matt's Big Breakfast - the food is really quite excellent, beginning first with a perfect hotcake served with pure maple syrup and far too much (or perhaps just the right amount of) butter for $2.75.\u000a\u000aMoving from the dainty golden flapjack to something more substantial, my second dish would actually consist of two plates and four items in the form of "The Chop & Chick" - an $8.95 breakfast comprised of a Pan Seared Iowa Pork Rib Chop with 2 Poached Eggs, Hash Browns, and Whole grain Toast with Blueberry Rhubarb Jam.  Apparently their most 'famous' dish it is a little difficult to decide which aspect of the plate was the best considering the quality of perfectly poached eggs (something even good restaurants tend to overcook,) crisp yet buttery potatoes and lightly herbed juicy pork chop but in the end I think I would have to give the nod to the toast - hand cut thick, rife with seeds and a rich earthiness, and topped with house made preserves featuring what seemed to be no sugar at all but rather the essence of blueberries with a slight savoriness from the rhubarb...a strong contender for best jam/preserves I've ever encountered and reason enough to revisit Matt's when it moves to its new digs a few doors down (and hopefully decreases wait times and seat bumps...and perhaps finds a coffee roaster whose beans better compliment the quality of the food.)

VBlueberry crepes, Banana/Chocolate/Nutella crepes, Creme Brulee, Tiramisu, Bread Pudding, Cannoli, Eclaire all in one meal?  Add Baklava and Buttercake and you'd have had my 8 favorite desserts in a single sitting.  Hello gluttony!!  \u000a\u000aI felt like a total pig after this meal.....and I didn't give a damn.  Good Croissants, made to order crepes, solid seafood, and a pricetag lower than Wynn or Bellagio.  \u000a\u000aAvoid the Asian food (what was I thinking.....its a FRENCH buffet in a FRENCH casino) and expect amazing things from a buffet......not what you'd normally get, for sure.

VA full review will eventually develop for the blog, but for the time being all I will say is that this should be on your Las Vegas "short list" for moderately priced dinner or an expensive lunch.\u000a\u000aFrench Tapas is the concept, the room layout is divine, the staff is will trained and educated, and the food is wonderful.  From a Foie Gras parfait to elegant and delicate gnocchi with basil and tomatoes, from souffle to flaming tableside absinthe......and please don't miss on the best Croque Monsieur in Vegas.\u000a\u000aThe four of us went three days after opening and Chef Keller was in house - he signed autographs and posed for pictures with my mother and aunt.....seems a humble man despite his recent fame due to Top Chef.

VFull review blog-side.\u000a\u000aL'AMUSE-BOUCHE, this evening featuring crémeux de foie gras au Porto et son émulsion au parmesan.  Essentially a double shot glass served on a stone the Foie gras parfait with port wine and parmesan foam was lovely.  Best eaten with a spoon the liver itself was surprisingly mild and melded perfectly (as expected) with the sweet port.  Topped with a foam lending salinity and levity I found this to be a restrained opening flavor that not only paired well with the champagne, but also gave a glimpse of what was to come.\u000a\u000aLE FOIE GRAS en duo mêlé de pomme ratte comme un carpaccio aux copeaux de truffe blanche, the dish was described as a carpaccio of foie gras and new potatoes topped with black and white truffle shavings.  A large portion of foie gras and potatoes I'll note that the truffles, though present, played a less prominent role than I'd have hoped.  With chipped parmesan and thin blades of greens and daikon also intertwined in the dish each bite was a new experience - sometimes with the unctuous liver coming to the forefront and at other times with the truffle perfumed potatoes taking center stage.  Though not my favorite dish of the meal, a single bite - foie, daikon, potato, truffle, parmesan - would be the perfect way to describe Robuchon's cuisine...multiple exotic yet restrained flavors coming together to form something entirely original and perfect.\u000a\u000aThe next course would be the third of four foie gras dishes for the evening.  Titled LE FOIE GRAS frais de canard cuit au torchon this version would be much more simplistic yet even better than the prior manifestation.  For $36 the traditionally poached chilled duck foie gras was delivered as a torchon accompanied by a dusting of espelette and topped with sea salt and cracked black pepper.  Sourced from the Gascony region of France the Foie was sweeter than I expected, though not artificially so.  Arriving with a plate of grilled country bread I imagine this dish took me ~20-25 minutes to eat as I savored each bite.\u000a\u000aLA LANGOUSTINE dans une papillote croustillante au basilica, or Crispy langoustine fritter with basil pesto featured a single Langoustine, sweet and perfect, wrapped in a leaf of basil and flash fried in a batter so thin it was transparent.  With the slight crackle of the shell giving way to sweet and snappy shellfish the effect was tremendous alone and better with the streaks of citrus and garlic pesto on the plate.  At $22 the price point is certainly not for everyone and if I had to eat Langoustine in Vegas I'd go to Twist first, but I was glad to have experienced this.\u000a\u000aL'OEUF cocotte et sa crème légère de champignons.  At $19 this is another relatively famous L'Atelier dish.  Featuring a farm fresh egg steamed until barely firm I watched the dish next covered in sautéed mushrooms by one chef while another whipped a foamy broth of cream, mushroom broth, and butter which was subsequently poured over the mushrooms.  Finally topped with salt, pepper, and chili powder the final presentation was visual foam with specks of pepper while beneath lied another perfect balance of ingredients.  Smooth and creamy egg, fibrous mushroom, plenty of butter - yet light as a cloud.\u000a\u000aThe next course would be a revelation - the sort of dish that on paper seems so simple yet in execution makes you realize why you even go to places like L'Atelier in the first place.  LE RIS DE VEAU clouté de laurier frais à la feuille de romaine farcie featured a single sweetbread-the largest I've ever seen at nearly the size of a tennis balll - pierced with a bay leaf and pan seared in butter, herbs, and veal jus before being paired on the plate with sautéed romaine lettuce in a faintly garlic and dill foam.  At $29 the offal itself cut easily with nothing but a fork and at 5-6 mouthfuls were the best tastes of the meal-almost caramelized on the exterior and creamy within.  A fan of elaborate dishes it is plates like this that remind me just how exquisite simplicity can be when done right.\u000a\u000aMy final bites from L'Atelier would be another classic dish and the only one seemingly served at each and every L'Atelier-LA CAILLE au foie gras, caramélisée avec une pomme purée truffée.  At $28 the portion was certainly small, but the impact of the caramelized foie gras stuffed free-range quail with Robuchon's famous truffled-mashed potatoes is undeniable-the whole plate is simply decadence defined.  Somewhat unbalanced compared to the other dishes I will note that the crispy quail was quite mild compared to the creamy liver, but obviously it's not like I mind the flavor of foie gras.  The potatoes - there really isn't anything else that can be said...having had the buttered version last year all I can say is that the truffles make them even better.\u000a\u000aOutstanding service and a true experience to watch the kitchen I'd definitely head back for a couple courses regularly if I lived locally, and of course to see what Chef Guechida was doing pastry side.

VLike the Premium Outlets North...except indoors, lower end, and cramped with center kiosks attempting to sell you garbage...so basically nothing like the Premium Outlets North and not really 'Premium' at all save for the Coach Store and perhaps Calvin Klein which is seemingly giving away their products at 25cents on the dollar during most visits.  Good for staples but certainly not the designer shopping experience it bills itself to be there are gems to be found for those willing to shop around but on the whole this is just another outlet mall, no more and no less.

VFrom the time when she still sold at La Grande Orange to Roosevelt to Central to the Old Town Farmer's Market to Vincent's Camelback Market I've made my rounds on the Tammie Coe collection and thus far have found no difference in quality from place to place and as such my review is the same for each.\u000a\u000aItems experienced thus far include:  Snickerdoodle, Chocolate Pumpkin Muffin, Maple Bacon Scone, Ooey Gooey, Red Velvet, Dark Cocoa Caramel Ooey Gooey, Carrot Cake, Blackberry Bran Muffin, Portobello Tart, Cinnamon Roll, Plum Streusel Brioche, Almond Butter Pastry, Tammie Coe Butterscotch Crumb Bun, MJ Flourless Chocolate cookie, Tammie Coe "Betters" Cookie, Tammie Coe Blueberry Coconut Tart.\u000a\u000aTrained from a young age, first by family and later formally, and known by both those who are interested in the culinary arts and those who simply have money to spend on a beautiful wedding or birthday cake I first experienced Tammie's pastry during my interview trip to Phoenix when her goods were still on display at La Grande Orange and as good as her oft raved cupcakes (which I'm told are comparable in texture and flavor to her famous designer cakes) are it is three of her less 'famous' items that make her pastry, in my opinion, 'destination worthy' - the Streusel Brioche a sort of portable French Toast hand Pie with a custard center and bruleed top, the Almond Butter Pastry a dense baton coated thick with confectioners' sugar and a texture somewhere between a buttermilk biscuit and a croissant, an finally the incomparable Crumb Bun whose swirls of sugar shellacked pastry peel away like that of a cinnamon roll with a texture akin to a Kouign Amann only to reveal pockets of rich butterscotch streusel...\u000a\u000a...and yeah, those ooey gooey cupcakes aren't too shabby either - a perfect cake:frosting ratio that, although very sweet at first, gradually reveals the tang of the cream cheese leading to balance - and for those who'd prefer something less sweet I'll also vouch for the impressively moist muffins or the truly inspired tart; a sort of Italian style macaroon meets blueberry muffin.

VItems Selected:\u000a\u000aCarrot Cake\u000aFrench Toast\u000aCheese Blintzes with Big Apple Sauce\u000aCoffee\u000a\u000aLocated inside The Mirage, 24-hour New York staple Carnegie Deli had long been one of those restaurants I figured I would 'eventually' patronize - the menu featuring a few items of interest but the Las Vegas Boulevard upcharge seemingly unjustified by 'deli food,' no matter how good - an early morning breakfast finally sparked by a group of friends staying at the hotel and the result a good time with surprisingly good food despite prices I'd still label exorbitant.  Bringing the signature 7th street delicatessen to a surprisingly small space just off the gaming floor where a few trios and quartets sat basking in the glow of the prior night's escapades behind enormous sandwiches and cauldrons of matzo ball soup it was to friendly service and overhead Sinatra that we arrived and seated immediately orders followed in an equally expedited manner, a total of perhaps nine items ordered but my focus on three plus a half-dozen refills to my cup of coffee.  Speaking first to my favorite 'appetizer,' the $8.50 slice of carrot cake proved competent and not overly sweet, but perhaps as a result of our early morning visit and a cake from last night the crumb delivered slightly dry and under-spiced - the impressive cream cheese icing thankfully buoying the dish, though none of it nearly as impressive as the $13.95 fried cheese blintzes whose light eggy tones and balanced parts savory meets sweet proved excellent on their own, yet far better with house-made applesauce taken bite-for-bite.  Eschewing  meats or omelets, though all looked good, it was in a Jewish deli's Challah that I placed my trust for a 'main course' and with three thick slices soaked in batter, fried golden in butter, and drowned in maple syrup I really could not have asked for more, the stack a veritable bargain at $10.95.

Sprawling in size and comfortably spaced with a menu chock-a-block full of clever twists on breakfast favorites both sweet and savory it was to the pleasant service of a woman named Debbie that we were greeted and with the meal divided into two courses comprised of five items, including one from the mid-day menu, plus copious refills of coffee rarely would any part of the experience falter - a ninety minute visit tallying $65 all-in for one of the Strip's more innovative breakfasts.  Starting slightly savory before progressing to things far sweeter it was with the duo of three thin Red Velvet pancakes gussied up by tangy cream cheese icing and a custardy masterpiece of a Monte Cristo with fresh strawberry preserves that the meal began and although biscuits and hash browns proved somewhat uninspired as optional sides portions of each proved ample for the price.  Opting next to explore the section entitled "French Toast and Waffles" with a pair of the former the plates that arrived would prove even more impressive than round one; both "breads" actually sliced cakes dipped in custard and griddled golden, the carrot lacking much vegetable but rich with spice while the tangy poppy seed version served as base to the unbridled flavor of fresh strawberries in a dessert-come-breakfast take on a summertime favorite that should not be missed.

VGreat prices and a huge selection plus a friendly and educated staff; who can argue with that?  Always a new gem to be found and a perfect stop for long lunches when there are no patient's to call back or labs to review, I expect this to be a long and rewarding relationship.

A whimsical concept with a plethora of breakfast staples "eggceptionally" categorized plus a number of seasonal specials it was without hesitation that eyes turned to things autumnal and with a full pot of coffee in hand each dish that followed was exactly as expected - fresh, comfortable, and delicious; the sort of thing you 'could' make at home but never do...though if you make banana bread this light and moist or carrot cake pudding moldable to crispy French Toast I'll gladly come over, bring the coffee, and do dishes.

VUnlike Nordstrom Rack or the direct outlets of Ferragamo, Porsche Design, Armani, and others at the North Premium Outlets "Off 5th" from Saks Fifth Avenue is nothing like its namesake store.  While the aforementioned spots are often found to be offering items off-season but flawless in quality at prices more than 50% off retail the Saks Outlet is largely selling items that never saw the light of day inside their stores - or items that may have sat on the bottom of the rack two years prior.  Browsing the Varvatos selection, for instance, displayed no John Varvatos Italian line options but rather all Varvatos USA while the "Grey" and "Red" labels from Saks make up less than 5% of their store at Fashion Show but more than 75% of that on offer "Off 5th."

V...it is very much a Love/Hate thing, but I lean towards the Love because they simply have so much useful stuff...and so much stuff that fits in obscure spaces.  No, it isn't the greatest quality furniture on earth, but for a dustpan, or a soap bowl, or a storage piece to fit in a narrow slot at the end of the hall?  Yeah, they've got that in about 6 different styles and 3 different colors.

VSee the blog for photos and the review of La Grande Orange Grocery for my thoughts on myriad other items from La Grande Orange group.  This one is specific to the menu items within the Pizzeria and will be updated as I try more.  All things being equal, I love this place.\u000a\u000aBaked Chicken Wings with Point Reyes Blue Cheese:  From the "LGO Pizzeria" menu that begins service at 4pm on weekdays and 11am on weekends it'd be hard for me to imagine a better way to watch football in a public space than at La Grande Orange.  Not a fan of bars, beers, or greasy bites LGO offers up a tasteful menu of traditional American gameday fare highlighted by these $1/ea. seared, seasoned, baked to order wings.  Featuring organic chicken, plenty of heat, and just a bit of char what really sets these wings apart is how plump and juicy they remain even without frying and also the dressing - a sort of "ranch" with subtle sourness, lots of chives, and big chunks of bleu cheese throughout.\u000a\u000aLGO Pizzeria Pizza - Half Classic Margherita and Half Roasted Corn with Laura Chenel Goat Cheese, Corn, roasted tomatoes, and basil:  An interesting pie to say the least, what strikes me most about LGO's pizza is the crust - a sort of sourdough starter that the team is making when the place opens at 6:30am and allowing to rise on the counter as lunch/dinner approaches.  Topped with the superior ingredients that LGO is well known for and slathered with a lot of quality olive oil plus a bit of butter the crust gets a great crunch without getting much char and although the oven isn't hot enough to generate the same blister as Bianco or Pomo (particularly as the bakers are opening/closing it frequently to put new pizzas in and take finished ones out) the structure remains supple with a great chew.  Much more willing to go half/half than the vast majority of high end pizzerias these days I found the Margherita as good as the ingredients, though they went a bit light on the tomatoes for my tastes while the Roasted corn was excellent, the smoky sweetness of the corn proving a perfect foil to the punchy chevre.

VSee profile site for full review with formatted pics.\u000a\u000a\u000aTo be fair, Sensi really didn't have much of a chance....not that it tried too hard either.  A meticulous planner, my dinner reservations going into Vegas were mapped out months in advance and my breakfast details planned out extensively.  While my lunches were unscheduled, I generally knew where I wanted to go and generally went there.  When my best friend decided at the last minute that Enoteca San Marco wasn't something he was interested in and suggested "something asian maybe" I remembered hearing good things about Sensi and turned to it as an alternative since my buddy had been so agreeable to places like MiX and Alex which weren't really his "scene."  Tucked in the back of Bellagio and pretty tough to find, unfortunately Sensi wasn't tough enough to find.\u000a\u000aSeated immediately near the admittedly awesome bread prep station, our 'waiter' Jeremy W briefly asked "sparkling or flat" and my friend stated flat.  We were brought an already opened bottle of Fiji and two glasses of ice.  When I suggested tap water would be fine, the 'waiter' stated "Well, the bottle is already opened."  The bottle cost $8 and was not comped despite our not wanting it.  Approximately ten minutes later menus were brought and essentially dropped off without explanation.  The waiter then returned approximately 10 minutes later with some Naan to go with our empty condiments (every other table was served fresh soy, salt, mustard, and tomato pepper chutney with their Naan...I had to stand up and get my own.  Orders were taken and this was the last we'd see of Jeremy until he delivered the bill.\u000a\u000aBrowsing the restaurant I must admit the décor was beautiful and watching the chef prepare the Naan was interesting.  After one basket of the delightful and doughy yet crisp bread topped with spicy chutney a non-descript server arrived and removed our basket, later returning with fresh bread.  This was the best service we received at Sensi.  \u000a\u000aAfter around 20 minutes our mains arrived, myself ordering Oven Roasted Diver Scallops with Basil Risotto, Zucchini, and Eggplant and my friend opting for the Shrimp and Beef with Duck Fried Rice.  All things being equal, the food was decent but certainly no better than I've had at far cheaper restaurants with vastly better service.  My scallops were a tad overdone but certainly fresh and tasty while the Risotto was soft yet consistent and contrasted well with the vegetables.  My friend additionally noted his dish was "pretty good."  Portion sizes were adequate but certainly not excessive considering the $20+ pricetags.\u000a\u000aAnother 15-20 minutes passed after the meal and thankfully I was seated close to the server's station where I was capable of filling my own glass with tap water because during that time no on arrived at our table.  Eventually Jeremy reappeared and without asking about dessert or anything else he delivered the check and collected our dishes.  "Have a great day" he said.  To be fair, it wouldn't have taken much to be a great day after such a disappointing meal with such lousy service.  The total bill was $56.03 and our most affordable meal of the trip.  No tip was left as no tip was deserved...I've had better service at Denny's.  \u000a\u000aThe only plus of the meal was that on the way back to the sportsbook and gaming floor we had to pass by the beautiful Bellagio gardens and Jean-Philippe where I ordered the best Tiramisu I've ever had.  Moral of the story?  If you're on your way to Sensi just stop, grab some tiramisu and gelato and watch the chocolate fountain.

V"Scenester" sushi bars are generally all about the glitz and less about the fish.  One would expect this to be even moreso in Las Vegas.  One would be incorrect.\u000a\u000aReservations for the patio overlooking the pirate show were easy on a Thursday night and the crowd was a mixed bag of older rich guys with their wives and younger hipsters wearing True Religion.  Like everywhere else in Vegas, however, it isn't as much about how you look as how you spend.  \u000a\u000aSeating was prompt and the servers were quick......too quick, IMO, to suggest the most expensive menu items when my buddy asked for recs.  Admittedly, though, he was knowledgable of the menu and knew how to guide my non-sushi-loving friend to some safe choices.\u000a\u000aThroughout the course of the meal we selected and sampled the Tempura shrimp with cold udon and sweet sauce, Unagi Avocado Rolls, Kobe Tartare Roll, Jalapeno Hamachi Tartare, Cracklin Scallops with grilled eggplant, Chocolate Lava Cake, and Mochi.  Each dish was delicious and my friend raved the Kobe roll so much I actually ate beef for the first time in 7 years (what happens in Vegas, I guess.)  Particular standouts were the flawless Scallops and the Cherry Blossom Mochi.\u000a\u000aAfter the pirate show (from an AWESOME angle directly behind and w/o the crowd) we made our way out to the bar area, and although not particularly my 'scene' had a great time.  The waitress was friendly (not to mention gorgeous,) the drinks were pricey but tasty, especially the espresso Martini, and the crowd was fun.\u000a\u000aAll told, for a "scenester" sushi club, the place is nice and the fish is much fresher than most places of the like.  If you're looking for a place with a good view of the strip, some dinner time entertainment, a happening scene afterwards, and decent prices (expected Vegas Markup) for the food quality I'd say Social House might fit the bill.

VWas put up here by an employer when interviewing for a job and although those on the strip may not even know the place exists The Marriott Grand Chateau is all the better for it.  Rooftop Pool, 24-hour Gym, Free Laundry, Free Valet, and spotless rooms plus friendly service - can't argue with any of it.  Steps from the strip with the feeling of being miles away when you are in your room; great place.

Decidedly different from the Luxe resort-casinos of the southern strip but featuring a gritty sort charm it was just after 5:00am when I arrived at Jerry's and with a skeleton crew catering to just six other patrons in the large space service was expectedly accommodating with coffee kept brimming throughout as a somewhat slow (likely understaffed) kitchen prepared hot dishes allowing me to focus first on pastry - a collection of over fifty options baked in-house featuring cakes, pies, danishes, donuts, and more.  Beginning with the famous "Strawberry Ring" it should first be stated that for a choux-based pastry baked at least 8 hours prior to remain crisp and buttery beneath two types of rich cream speaks volumes to the quality of kitchen and with both textures and flavors aplenty the dish proved wonderful, a lightly sweet take on the Paris-Brest with a portion big enough for two or three more than justifying the $6 tab.  Working slowly through the ring with frequent coffee refills as I awaited my sandwich it was with some disappointment that when the Monte Cristo arrived the flavors would only prove average, the fried bread shining while proteins and cheese proved meager in both taste and portion, but propping the dish up with a touch of real maple syrup it should be said that at $1 each, the biscuits at Jerry's are worth seeking out - an excellent rise and good layer separation beneath a crisp, buttered top.  Taking the rest of my order to go, a veritable bargain at $5/slice, suffice it to say that while Jerry's may not be the best choice in town for a sandwich I'd be hard pressed to name a better choice for cake as each of my three selections shined; the anniversary cake a sort of dulce de leche with buttercream and frangipane vying for top billing over a delicate crumb, the bread pudding featuring two layers of rich pound cake topped with lightly sweetened egg custard and a bruleed top, and the carrot cake dense with cinnamon, nutmeg, carrots, raisins, and walnuts beneath thin ribbons of cream cheese frosting - the best I've found in the city to date and a contender for the best I've tasted anywhere in years.

VHaving now lived in 3 states in 3 years I've had quite enough of the DMV and its varying rules from place to place but to say that the NV DMV is the worst yet would be an understatement.  Truly filthy facilities, vastly overpriced services, poor infrastructure, and quite possibly the rudest clerks I have ever encountered combine to create an experience even worse than it needs to be.\u000a\u000aNote to those moving to the state, even though the "everything you need to know" paperwork does not state these facts please keep the following in mind.  In order to process license and registration you will need not only a "VIN Inspection" but also a Smog Check - the later listed as "if necessary" on the form but "absolutely necessary" unless your car was purchased less than 365 days prior to the process.\u000a\u000aExpect long waits.  Expect to spend at least $300.  And if you're really lucky expect the computer system to crash and the cops to be called in order to maintain order as people you can't even imagine able to afford a car get all up in arms while you sit there what you did in a past life to warrant such a debacle.

VOwned and operated by Eugenia Theodosopoulos (an Ohio native, fyi) and considered by many to be the best patisserie/bakery in the state I approached Essence with a note of skepticism largely assuming much of the hype was derived from Tempe's plethoric college crowd but arriving at the doors of the small shop on a particularly lovely 80 degree morning I gathered quite quickly that my original conceptions were misplaced; not only does Essence not look like a college haunt, neither do its prices or products - a vast selection of at least twenty items aside from the posted menu sitting beneath and atop a glass case forcing me to make more than one tough decision that was not helped by my server's accurate assessment that everything was really good.\u000a\u000aNow bearing in mind that the original impetus to visit Tempe on this particular morning was to visit Caffe Boa and that Essence was more of 'pre-meal' activity what follows may seem slightly gluttonous, but to be fair once I took my first bite of Theodosopoulos's École Lenôtre trained almond croissant I knew I was in good hands and everything else just sort of followed.  Without a doubt my favorite breakfast pastry and perhaps my favorite French pastry overall, Essence's $3 twice baked option arrives slightly smaller than the average but with a shell that crackles to the tooth and an interior that is at once yawning pockets of air and nearly overloaded with butter and light frangipane there is no doubt that this is a case of "big things in small packages," and particularly in its still-warm morning state the flavors and textures rivaled those at Dominique Ansel and Payard Las Vegas for best I've had stateside.\u000a\u000aMoving next from the baked goods to one prepared from the menu my second taste of the morning aside from the slightly earthy and lightly leather accented coffee was Essence's "Signature" French Toast, a $7.25 selection featuring three griddled slices of eggy brioche and a sidecar of what I can best describe as banana infused caramel.  Rich but thinly sliced and therefore nicely saturated each piece of the French Toast was exactly as it should be - the exterior crisp and the interior custard-while the sauce provided a pleasant balance of fruity notes and intrinsic sweetness that complimented rather than overwhelming the bread.\u000a\u000aAt this point submitting to the fact that I was going to eat even the items I'd bought 'for later,' my next two tastes were a pair of $2.95 macarons that, much like the croissant, rivaled those both here and abroad in terms of taste and texture while opting for a much more rustic approach terms of size and presentation.  Beginning first with Pumpkin Spice and then proceeding to Vanilla with Dark Rum each palm-sized cookie was exactly what one would expect from a well trained pastry chef as the exterior shell provided a slight crackle on bite subsequently giving way to a soft meringue followed by dense cream that slowly dissipated on the tongue - the cinnamon and nutmeg notes of the former particularly notable while the rum in the second was appropriately understated thus serving to highlight the vanilla of the shell.\u000a\u000aIf there were any 'misstep' on the morning, it *might* have been the "Summer Berry Croissant Bread Pudding," though when I say misstep I must temper the comment with the fact that my quibble is only that I prefer the French/English take on the dish while this one was more based on the French Custard style, a rich vanilla bean pudding without a lot of crunch or textural variance but instead laden with blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries plus a sidecar of lightly sugared strawberries.  Focusing more of the natural sweetness of the fruits and aromatics of the vanilla than the typical overly sweet versions served stateside it was more panna cotta than bread pudding to me, but chalking that up to personal tastes it was still delicious.\u000a\u000aMoving last to the one dish that gave me trepidation, the "French Napoleon" gave caused pause not only because the name clearly skewed towards a subset unfamiliar with a proper Mille-Feuille but also because so many pre-made versions of this layered pastry have failed to wow in the past...thankfully this was not the case at Essence.  Featuring light and crunchy layers of choux easily withstanding the tines of a fork without turning into a smooshy mess (see "Mille Feuille New York") intertwined with rich pastry cream speckled with dots of vanilla bean and ripe raspberries what truly made this version stand out was the manner in which Theodosopoulos caramelized each layer of choux, a technique reminiscent of Pierre Herme and as good as the French icon's version was I'd be hard pressed to say Essence's was any less impressive.  It would be awesome to see what they could do a la minut like Savoy, L'Arpege, or Genin and given the names I've dropped in the paragraphs above plus Essence's proximity I've no doubt I'll be returning to see what else the small shop is capable of soon.

Sterile and commercial in design despite the local owners and organic approach it was just shortly after the 9am opening that I arrived at the restaurant and with my friend running late I was encouraged to order without her, an easy enough process entailing four pastry selections plus one from the kitchen and taking a seat with items to be plated and delivered it would not be long before my choices arrived; my friend walking in mere moments before the French Toast which she declined to taste due to the raisins just as I knew she would.  Overall a decent collection with options ranging from crisp and surprisingly subtle Baklava plus one of the most buttery coffee cakes I have had in recent memory to a 'scone' whose texture more closely resembled that of a muffin and dense, flavorless bread pudding  I cannot say I would venture down to Henderson for Layers, though perhaps if they were slicing (or willing to slice) the Golden Nugget or Bloody Good cake I'd reconsider.

VI went here for an interview dinner and was pleasantly surprised; not a chain guy or a steakhouse guy this is where the team wanted to have dinner and as such I obliged to the order of twin lobster tails with drawn better, cream corn soufflé, and fresh summer berries with whipped cream - a $78 order I'd have much preferred to spend at Parma, Fat Choy, Honey Salt, or many other local chef driven restaurants, yet Fleming's nailed them all.  I'd not return on my dollar, but if you want to take a terribly unadventurous eater out for a 'safe' steak dinner you could do a whole lot worse.

VFull review in Blog.  Some highlights below.\u000a\u000aArriving approximately 15 minutes early at The Palace I made my way to the Augustus Tower and took some pictures before entering the restaurant - doors held open for me by a pair of young ladies and greeted - literally - by Mr. Savoy, a bright smile, and a "Doctor U. I presume?"  Somewhat taken aback by such a warm greeting I confirmed my name and shook the managers hand before being escorted to my table in the main dining room.\u000a\u000aWith my menu presented and myself settled in for a great experience the meal began with a pair of Canapes - both signature trademarks of Guy Savoy's restaurant both here and overseas.  The first dish, entitled "French club" consisted of alternating layers of duck foie gras, truffles, and brioche - now that is how you start a meal.  No bigger than the distal part of my thumb the dish was excellent with the buttery bread and earthy truffle providing the first flavor and fragrance but later giving way to the intensely creamy foie gras that lingered on the palate it its signature manner.  Without trying to sound too gluttonous I could've (and would've) eaten at least 50 of these given the chance.  \u000a\u000aKicking off the official portion of the tasting menu I was brought a dish entitled Mosaic of Milk Fed Poularde, Foie Gras, Artichoke with Black Truffle Jus (Bread pairing Toasted Country Bread.)  Featuring layers of pounded and roasted chicken that was on par with the version at The French Laundy interspersed with creamy and unctuous moularde duck foie gras and a pureed artichoke the dish was one of the best mixed terrines I've ever tasted with the creamy foie, savory chicken, and smooth artichoke each standing separate yet also blending effortlessly to form a uniform taste that somewhat resembled mushroom - all of this was of course brought to an even more potent effect by the addition of a salty and earthy jus that tasted like the very essence of a black truffle and clung to the palate.  Pairing well with the warmed bread I spread each bite thin and savored this dish a great deal.\u000a\u000aExtremely happy with the meal thus far I was next greeted by one of Monsieur Savoy's most famous dishes - the Colors of Caviar (Bread pairing Plain Ciabatta.)  A multilayered "parfait" of sorts this dish was described at length but essentially consisted of multiple layers of caviar - a chilled caviar creme, a hot egg caviar sabayon, a caviar gelee, a smooth and salty green bean puree,  and a thick layer of cool Ossetra egg - eaten with a mother of pearl spoon.  Instructed to eat bites of each layer all at once I dug into the dish slowly and let the amalgam dissolve slowly in my mouth; unreal.  While I cannot say what the exact overarching flavor of the dish was, the feel of the dish was tremendous with a progression of flavors, textures, temperatures, and densities - a true "study" of the food.  Interestingly because of its presentation each bite actually offered a different sensation and progression due to the way the concoction came out on the spoon.  At $90 (off menu price) this is the most expensive single dish I've ever tasted and had it not been on the menu I'd likely not have indulged - but I'm certainly glad I did.  The bread served with this dish was clearly meant to do nothing but allow the caviar to shine - a plain and boring ciabatta that I tasted and discarded the rest of.\u000a\u000aDiverting from the classics to something I love the next dish was Radis-Foie, or Foie-Gras "en Papillote" and Radish Bouillon (Bread pairing Caramelized Onion Ciabatta.)  Having had my first truly amazing cooked Foie a few weeks earlier at Blackbird (a roasted prep) and L2O (first seared then roasted and served in a cotton candy shell) I was very intrigued by this dish and its novel method of preparation - first seared and then cooked not-exactly "en Papillote" or parchment, but rather steamed in sherry vinegar with pink and white radishes in a plastic bag which is presented tableside before being opened up and returned to the kitchen for plating.  Shying away from traditional accoutrements like fruit and nuts the kitchen at Guy Savoy instead chooses to temper their foie with bitter as opposed to sweet utilizing the bitter radish leafs and mild yet spicy radishes to further balance the foie's characteristic unctuous and buttery body.  While I personally love the majority of sweet Foie Gras preparations I've experienced I have to say this prep was an eye opener for me and a true showing of Guy's brilliance.  Speaking later with the Chef du cuisine during my tour of the kitchen it was actually this dish that garnered the majority of our discussion - apparently the use of bitters and spices to temper the liver is much more commonplace in France and Italy than in the United States due to their larger consumption of the dish and "American's have a sweet tooth."  While I'll not argue with my love of sweets I will say that this dish is one of the best Foie Gras preps I've had.

VFar less crowded than the local Target I sometimes find myself in this area and have rarely been let down by the products they carry.  That said, prices are still higher and selection is still smaller than the Walmart a few doors down and without the copious produce section I need to survive the week this place only works in a pinch.

Surely one of the more trendy Mina properties, lodged in Mandalay Bay with high ceilings, slick design, and plenty of polish to compliment the thumping music it was just moments before our 7:00pm reservation that we presented to the hostess stand and quickly whisked to a table along the back wall it was with ample pleasantries that we were greeted, a trio of $15 cocktails to compliment the duck fat fries soon in hand but something immediately awry as the area's temperature trumped eighty degrees - a trend to continue for the next two hours despite repeated complaints and the apparent efforts of restaurant manager Ashley to contact maintenance as beads of sweat rolled down our brows.  Suffering largely in silence so as not to disrupt the celebration but clearly uncomfortable it would not be long after seating that our five-course menu would commence and wanting for a truly grand experience each round of food arrived as a trio, items including the "Instant Bacon," Bone Marrow, Spinach Souffle, and Wagyu vs. Wagyu truly exemplary while the foie gras, chicken, and halibut were inexplicably overcooked to the point where the first two were nearly inedible while the later - a gift from the kitchen - was saved only by its aromatic sauce.  Eventually moved to a table in the front dining room for a breath of fresh air mid-way into a main course where veal was presented instead of the pork that I'd ordered it was at last in the finale that STRIPSTEAK would prove most impressive with a trio of world class desserts followed by the restaurant's signature beignets but with both managers avoiding our table as the $500 tab for Chef Gerald Chin's uneven cooking arrived I could only shake my head wondering when Chef Mina last stopped by Mandalay Bay, a stunning departure from memorable experiences at Bourbon Steak, Wit and Wisdom, American Fish, or Arcadia.

VApparently hailing from the British city of Cornwall and here in Arizona finding its foothold at the appropriately named Cornish Pasty Company I had originally heard of the pasty during a recent trip to Philadelphia where the baked crescent was a daily special on the menu at The Dandelion but featuring the least the combination of beef, rutabaga, onion, and potato I cannot really say my interest as high - a situation remedied by the extensive (if inauthentic selection at Cornish Pasty Company and thus leading me through their doors just after 2:30pm where I'd find the small bar area still full but the larger dining room only perhaps half so.\u000a\u000aLargely unaware of the logistics of CPC - whether you seat yourself or wait to be seated and whether you order at the counter or at a table I stood and watched for a moment before deciding to seat myself and within moments a friendly young woman named Hannah greeted me, first offering a beverage - just water - and subsequently the restaurant's extensive menu which I browsed at length while listening to The Sex Pistols and then The Clash play overhead.  An eclectic list of Pasty's both 'traditional,' 'signature,' and 'premium' plus a collection of soups, salads, and sides I asked Hannah about portions on her return and told that each pasty clocked in at approximately a pound (and that two would be "way too much" food for a solo diner since she could only eat half of one) thus leading me to settle on a single option, a dish I was told would take "about fifteen minutes," leaving me more time to study and enjoy the tunes - the White Stripes perhaps the only thing 'un-British' in a string of songs ranging from Zeppelin to The Beatles to The Ramones.\u000a\u000aReading as I waited and enjoying the room as well as watching the team slice meat, shape dough, and chop vegetables it would be just under a quarter hour before my dish arrived and although smaller than I'd imagined (I definitely could have eaten two - probably three if I didn't have dessert and dinner plans) the Shepherd's Pie that was presented was far better than I'd have ever expected, a golden buttery shell wrapped around lightly mint tinged lamb and although fatty and intense nicely balanced by the vegetables.  Generally a fan of Shepherd's Pie, particularly when using a sharp cheddar, this handheld version would prove to be an exemplary take on the classic and the addition of a sidecar of onion and sage laden red wine gravy certainly did not hurt.\u000a\u000aDebating a second pasty as Hannah returned to check in on me (The Pilgrim sounds quite good) but subsequently turning my attention to the sweeter half of the menu I decided to not make the same mistake twice and inquiring as to which dessert she recommended I went with my gut and ordered two to arrive with a delay between them, the first "Shirley Temple's Pudding," a $6 sticky toffee pudding served in a cast iron pot with a side of crème anglaise.  Rich and thick, a dark treacle just barely set at the center and almost a brownie consistency along the edges what really shined about this dish was the manner in which it worked with the crème, a thick but delicate sauce balancing out the intense sweetness of the pudding.\u000a\u000aMoving next to my second dessert, and for my tastes the better of the two, a goodly delay of fifteen minutes brought to the table Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding with vanilla ice cream - a truly unique spin on bread pudding made with what almost seemed to be cracker-thin pieces of bread juxtaposing a brandy tinged chocolate sauce and baked much like the sticky toffee pudding to be set at the edges yet dense and moist at the center.  Truly a decadent dessert - the sort begging for a glass of milk or coffee - I will say that the ice cream was rather run-of-the-mill vanilla and although it served its purpose admirably I'd definitely go with more anglaise on subsequent visits - visits which I'm sure will happen the next time I find myself drawn back to Tempe, or to Mesa where there is apparently a second location whose Banoffee Pie and Apple Caramel Pasties seem to be calling.

VSecond visit, just as good as the first:\u000a\u000aMushroom, Walnut, Spinach Soup with Homemade Bread and Butter\u000a\u000aCheese Steak - Onions, Green Pepper, Mushroom, Swiss, Red Wine Gravy\u000a\u000aChicken Pot Pie - Carrots, Red Potato, Green Beans, Celery, Thyme and Chicken Gravy\u000a\u000aThe Pilgrim - Turkey, Sweet Potatoes, Grilled Onion, Stuffing, Cranberry Sauce\u000a\u000aBanoffee Pie - Graham Cracker Crust, Caramel, Whipped Cream, Bananas\u000a\u000aApple Caramel Pasty - Apples, Cinnamon, Caramel topped with Ice Cream and Whipped Cream\u000a\u000aMoving from sweet to savory (and then back to sweet) our arrival at Cornish Pasty Company was met with a raucous crowd enjoying any number of craft brews but seated swiftly as Led Zeppelin, The Who, and The Ramones competed for air time overhead we were greeted equally quickly by an excellent (and funny without being fakey) young server who understood our time constraints in terms of making it to the game and took our whole order at once noting that she'd place the order in a staggered manner to make sure food wouldn't pile up while still leaving us time to make it to ASU by kickoff - a plan that worked flawlessly.\u000a\u000aKnowing from my last visit that the pasties would all be excellent - and they were - what truly wowed during this visit to Cornish Pasty Co was actually the soup, a recommendation from our server as "her favorite thing on the menu" - a dense, creamless potage with a hefty mushroom nose and a subtle vegetal note on the tongue while the walnut base added a lingering smoothness that went well with the hearty housemade soda bread and cultured butter.  Obviously not leaving without dessert and having already enjoyed the sticky toffee pudding and bread pudding on my prior visit this time we opted for the house-special Banoffee Pie and Caramel Apple Pasty, neither as good as the pair off puddings but both better than the vast majority of in-house pastries at restaurants in Phoenix and Scottsdale (where even top tier restaurants choose to outsource their desserts to Ms. Dempsey.)

VMy Wildflower of Choice not only because the seating options are much more conducive to studying, but also because the way the soda and coffee layout prevents the clustering of people that makes the Pima location less than ideal.  Good coffee at a fair price, free wi-fi, and the Newt Glass work always makes me smile.

VItems Selected:\u000aChocolate Chocolate Chip\u000aStrawberries and Cream\u000aMarble\u000aCarrot\u000aPecan Praline\u000aRed Velvet\u000a\u000aBorn in Las Vegas and since spread across the United States it was not until a co-worker's birthday went unnoticed by the administration that I finally satisfied my curiosity regarding Nothing Bundt Cakes, a quick drive to the West Sahara flagship procuring an 8" Chocolate Chocolate Chip for the celebration and four $4 'individuals' for my own personal taste testing.  Originally opened by longtime friends Dena and Debra just as I was finishing high-school and now following a calculated plan of expansion through franchising it was just shy of 5 o'clock on Friday that I entered the expansive storefront and with clever gifts plus endless options for customization abound I attempted to take my time to browse, a small clerk slightly irksome in her repeated interruptions, though well intended I'm sure.  Cute and quaint without seeming 'cutesy' or twee - a down-home feel befitting the ten flavors of rounded cakes - it was perhaps five minutes and a half-dozen customers that separated my entry from my order and rebuffed in my inquiry of what was best by "everything is good" lipservice I went with my gut - a light bite of seasonal strawberry cake harkening angel-food in consistency accompanying me out the door and each flavor to follow showing strongly beneath buttered cream cheese frosting rivaling the best I've experienced.  Artisan in many regards but readily admitting the use of artificial flavors without tossing about superlatives of 'organic' or 'cage-free' it was with the coffee-cake harkening "Marble" that my tasting began and with rich cinnamon swirls proving an amicable bridge to spicy, dense Carrot Cake I could not help but smile even as Red Velvet proved slightly dry - a mistake not replicated by the complex flavors of smoky candied pecans atop a pudding-come-cake that could very well replace a King Cake in next Mardi Gras.

VSeriously - more than one entrance would be nice.....y'know, like one that didn't require me parking in the middle of the parking lot and then walking around 10+ stores and restaurants in the 100+ degree sun simply to get to the entrance.\u000a\u000aThat said, overall a very nice theater once you get inside, and with an IMAX to boot I'm sure I'll be back regardless of how assinine the process of getting inside is.

VI really try to like Old Town Scottsdale - and if you look past all the God-Awful tourist traps it is actually quite a nice place with a number of top notch dining options - but in the end you can only walk by so many mass-produced "native" jewelry shops with "Bargains" before it all starts blending together.  Parking is generally a travesty but can be found if you're willing to wait it out and the public art is a nice touch.  For my dollar - go, grab a spot, and kill some time at Cartel, grab some local foods at Bodega, and maybe consider a bite at one of the locally owned restaurants like FnB or Praying Monk, and skip any place with turquoise jewelry in the window while focusing on the galleries that don't quite seem to fit the 'theme.'

VLiterally walking distance from my door I'm still of mixed feelings about Red Rock.  Sure it has a convenient theater and bowling, but both are overpriced compared to other 'locals' casinos.  Sure it has some unique restaurants, but they are in a constant state of chef turnover and flux.  Add in the fact that there is no shopping to speak of until the Shops at Summerlin open and I see this as a nice "upscale" locals spot, but not something one should go out of their way of for anything other than gambling and perhaps the occasional night of entertainment.  Credit is due to the "no smoking" games, but they really aren't so far off from the standard games and options are limited.

VItems selected:\u000a\u000aCoffee\u000aBiscuit with Housemade Jam (Strawberry, Apple Butter)\u000aMonte Cristo\u000aCarrot Cake\u000a\u000aPart of the local dining scene since 1994, long before San Diego import "Hash House A Go-Go" splashed down with gluttonous portions at no less than three separate spots, Mary's Hash House on Decatur had always been a place I intended to go and yet for whatever reason it was not until I realized the owner hailed from my home state of Ohio that I finally committed to an early morning visit, a 6:05 am arrival finding a pair of regulars already present amidst the cozy confines as Mary and one other tended both kitchen and front of house in the most pleasant of manners.  Perhaps the most homey of places I've found since relocating to Sin City with aged wood furniture beneath sturdy tables and papered walls decorated by assorted knick-knacks dotting the two rooms it was with hot coffee, medium or dark, plus a menu of farm fresh favorites that I was greeted and although nearly all of the hashes and griddled favorites sounded good it was to traditional favorites that I turned, the meal kicked off by a rustic slice of carrot cake with tangy cream cheese layered on just that morning as I awaited my main course.  Truly 'home-style' with everything made in-house and to order including breads, jams, and jellies it would be perhaps twenty minutes and three coffee top-offs before my primary plate would arrive but proving the adage that good things come to those who wait it was with stunning results when the Monte Cristo was delivered; a true golden fried version with ham, turkey, and Swiss sealed inside ready to be gilded by maple syrup for a perfect sweet meets savory bite trumping any version of the classic sandwich that I've found in Las Vegas to date - a golden buttermilk biscuit with two of nearly a dozen types of jam offered as an alternative to homefries or potatoes no less impressive and briefly making me long for the Midwest...though certainly not for the February weather.

Locally owned and operated with a menu of drinks both classic and novel plus a collection of "pastries baked fresh on the premises" it with a simple Americano that my experience began and faring well enough at a mere $2.50 it was onward to pastry that I moved, the promise of '100% Charent Butter' ostensibly promising the quality of Echire but not a single item better than average, with one in particular an early contender for worst thing I'll eat in 2014.  Starting first with a $3.24 Almond Croissant it would be hard to imagine something more doughy and less crisp coming from 7-Eleven and moving right along to a $2.50 White Chocolate Raspberry Macaron with decent crackle yielding gummy crumb and sweet 'frosting' of a non-descript flavor I sat and wondered exactly what was going on; a brief reprieve found in admirable, albeit microwave-heated bread pudding drizzled in light caramel.  At this point sitting with half a macaron and 2/3 of the croissant unfinished it was last, and certainly least that I moved to the 'nutellamisu" and while certainly not the prettiest presentation nothing could have prepared me for the taste - an acrid, sour, and questionably spoiled cream cheese 'pudding' debauchery of the Italian classic that tasted nothing of Nutella or Tiramisu, a second bite of the $3.95 cup yielding similar results and landing it plus the remaining pastries in the trash as I left the store thankful I'd not yet finished my coffee so as to cleanse my palate.

A great meal is a kind of journey that returns you to sources of pleasure you may have forgotten and takes you to places you haven't been before." \u000a\u000aWith quotes like that you know his food is not a joke, and I will admit a bias to Thomas Keller's concepts and food.  From peanut butter and jelly to quiche to gnocchi to bread and butter to cookies and cakes the man simply does amazing things with food.  The best french toast I've ever eaten, the best quiche, the best cookie....and service that never fails to make you feel like the most important guest on earth.  With those things in mind my Vegas vacation entailed two visits to Bouchon Bistro and four visits to Bouchon Bakery for mid-day snacks.\u000a\u000aOn day one, selections after lunch entailed a Red Velvet Cupcake and Keller's seasonal bread pudding.  Consumed in the Venezia Gardens/Pool area outside Bouchon Bistro, I can definitely say the cupcake was the best Red Velvet I've ever consumed.  Creamy cream cheese and creme fraiche frosting with a hint of cocoa served over (and throughout) a moist and delectable cake with strong hints of cinnamon and chocolate, plus the earthy taste of the beat sugar used for sweetness and color....sublime.  Better than Crumbs, Beasley, Yummy, Sprinkles, and even Doughboy's famous version.  Even better than Piece of Cake in Columbus, my previous favorite.  After the cupcake I shopped Vegas for a bit and then ate the Bread Pudding rewarmed in the hotel microwave.  Sweet but savory, dense yet not "wet," and loaded with cranberry, raisin, and white raisin....awesome.  Not as good as the french toast version at Bouchon Bistro, but in my top 5 Bread Puddings, for sure.\u000a\u000aDay two selections, after breakfast at Bouchon, entailed two beignets and a Macaroon.  A flawless Coffee Macaroon was first and was just as flawless as the Caramel one in New York in June.  Airy, crisp, sweet, and flavorful.  Not as good as the Macaroons at Pistacia Vera, but close, and much larger.  The Beignets selected were small filled donuts stuffed with Vanilla Custard and Raspberry jam.  Both were light and flavorful, still warm, and the fillings were potent without being overpowering of the buttery beignets.  Personally I enjoyed the unfilled \u000aBeignets at Bouchon Bistro better, but these certainly best Dunkin, Krispy Kreme, Bob's, or other "donut" shoppes.\u000a\u000aDay three, stuffed after dinner before and planning for Alex in the evening, a single Carrot Cake Sandwich Cookie was chosen.  As good as the Cupcake and Bread Pudding were, this was the "bar raiser" in terms of wow factor.  Having had the TKO and Nutter Butter while in NYC, I really didn't think cookies could get better.  WRONG!  I like Carrot Cake and I've had some good ones, but this thing was surreal.  Smaller than a hockey puck it literally weighed approximately 8oz and was absolutely loaded with the fibrous texture of carrots, yet perfectly balanced and soft like a cake.  Hints of cinnamon and vanilla plus the subtle taste of pineapple in the frosting....I wish this recipe were in the Bouchon Cookbook.  Actually...why doesn't Keller share the recipes for all three cookies in his next book?\u000a\u000aDay four, after brunch at Bouchon with the transcendent French Toast and unfilled beignets, I opted for a single Banana Nut Muffin which I consumed with the coffee at the Palazzo sportsbook while watching Terrell Pryor ascend to king of Columbus back home.  After consuming the muffin I only wished Keller would take Bouchon Bakery nationwide so I could consume all of these things back home.  Weighing in at likely a pound, the texture was on par with the carrot cake and the flavor equally subtle yet fantastic.  Sticky sweet, topped with a cinnamon crumble, and \u000aperfectly moist....I was sad that some of it stuck to the paper, despite being overly full.\u000a\u000aBetween Alex, Le Cirque, MiX, Craftsteak, Bouchon, and so many other highly regarded restaurants in Vegas I definitively had a GREAT culinary trip....my only regret is that I didn't have more room in my stomach.  If I had, I'd have certainly filled it with more goods from Bouchon.  Impressive goals often lead to impressive results.  "Respect for food is a respect for life, for who we are and what we do."  -- Thomas Keller

V...you wake up after a meal at Joel Robuchon and the gym at Excalibur (really, it isn't that bad) is the only free one in the city...you run your normal 6 miles with the amazing sort of energy that only about 3,000 calories of luxurious French Food can provide.  Next you check out of the castle, stow your bags at the Venetian (home for the next 3 days) - time for some Bouchon bakery!\u000a\u000aHaving been to each of Keller's three wonderful bakeries in the past year (along with both Bouchons, The French Laundry,and Ad Hoc) I - the guy who doesn't regularly "repeat" in vacation cities - knew that a stop or two at the bakery and a visit to Bouchon itself would definitely be on the docket for this trip to Vegas.  Arriving around 7:15am and checking out the fresh selection I must admit I was a little disappointed that so few new choices existed from last year - everything from the macarons to the cupcakes to the éclairs were the same.  Waiting in the short line and browsing the items I eventually settled on a couple of choices knowing I'd be back later to pick up macarons for my mother anyhow.\u000a\u000aStarting first with the Cinnamon Brioche I have to say that this was the first time a Bouchon item ever let me down.  Served as a sort of "pull-apart" the cinnamon speckled bun was quite expensive at $4.50 and it honestly tasted like it may have been left over from the day before.  Appropriately buttery but relatively dry the bread tasted more of a dinner roll than a true brioche and the cinnamon was largely lost on my palate.  Furthering my opinion that I'd been hoodwinked on a day-old, the center piece was actually much better and more moist than the outer ring - evidence of "drying out" perhaps.\u000a\u000aThe second selection was the saving grace of the visit - a luscious strawberry croissant that was almost as much a coffee cake as a true croissant.  Featuring the wonderfully buttery French pastry that I sampled on last visit (with chocolate and almonds) the inside of the flaky pastry was this time filled with sliced fresh strawberries while the bottom of the croissant was covered with a cinnamon and butter crumble.  Crisp shell and soft interior - buttery, tart, fresh, excellent.\u000a\u000aWhile I admit that this visit wasn't as wonderful as previous experiences with Bouchon Bakery, the service was still excellent and when I returned the day before leaving for home to purchase the macarons they actually did a wonderful job in packaging the cookies for the long flight home.  Selecting Strawberry, Lemon, and Orange my mom stated that the brown/green box was her favorite souvenir from this as well as many of my previous trips.  Can't really argue with that.

V...I'm no stranger to Bouchon or its sister Bakery - I've been to each of them at least once and to the Vegas location multiple times on each previous trip.  Like my previous stays in Vegas this vacation would be no different - except this time the offerings featured a holiday appropriate theme.  Visiting the bakery four times during out five days in Vegas many repeats were ordered and all remained as excellent as prior - the Carrot Cake cookie, the Nutter Butter, the Red Velvet Cupcake, the Pistachio Macaron, and the Pain au Chocolate to name a few.  Focusing my own ordering on new items and holiday themed selections I managed to sample six new items during the various visits.\u000a\u000aBeginning first with the croissant of the month, December featured Dutch Apple.  While I personally feel that "croissant" is a bit of a misnomer for such a dense pastry, the dough was unmistakably the same - the difference was the presentation.  Essentially a hemi-sected butter croissant topped with cinnamon roasted apples and buttery strudel topping the flavor was that of apple crisp in a warm and portable form.\u000a\u000aMoving on to the holiday items, my first would be the Christmas Tree TKO.  For those unfamiliar with Keller's famous take on the Oreo, the recipe is out there and the cookie is divine.  This time cut into the shape of a Christmas tree and filled with a mint chocolate cream I personally fancy the original more so as I find mint to be overpowering.  On the contrary, however, my mother loved this cookie and ended up with two in her luggage in addition to the two she ate while in Vegas.\u000a\u000aAnother holiday special featured a frosted shortbread snowflake.  At a cost of $4.50 the palm-sized cookie likely weighed in at nearly 8 ounces and if I had to guess the cost was almost entirely based on the full stick of butter included.  Dense and crisp, the cookie quite literally melted in the mouth leaving behind a sweet buttery memory.  Not for the faint of heart (or high in cholesterol) a single cookie was almost "too much," but thankfully there was a group of four to split the pair we ordered.\u000a\u000aThe gingerbread man (and accompanying woman) were a bit of a letdown in my personal opinion.  Lightly frosted and quite thin the cookies were hefty in cinnamon and sweetness, but rather lacking in the characteristic gingerbread flavor.\u000a\u000aA fan of all things mint and equally of macarons, the Peppermint Macaron was a no-brainer for my mother.  For those unfamiliar with Bouchon's style of Macaron, they are approximately the size of an adult male palm and when fresh they are every bit on par with the best I've tasted in the United States.  A shining example, the peppermint variation featured the characteristic crackling shell which gave way to the soft and supple cookie within.  Filled with a cocoa accented peppermint ganache I know some folks contest that Bouchon's macarons are too sweet and while I'll fully admit this was the sweetest I've tasted, the flavor was akin to a York Peppermint Patty in cookie form - it was delicious.\u000a\u000aThe final selection of our visits to Bouchon Bakery would be the Chocolate Bouche de Noel.  Served as a 1.5 inch thick slice of the "log" and garnished with meringue mushrooms and cocoa covered almond stones, the chocolate Génoise was rolled and frosted with chocolate buttercream and lightly dusted with confectioner's sugar snow.  Dense and filling I was glad I ordered coffee with the cake while my companions contested this was the sort of dish best enjoyed with milk.\u000a\u000aRarely one to revisit the same spot multiple times at all let alone on the same visit I will continue to frequent Bouchon and Bouchon Bakery whenever I have the chance - like when I visited the Beverly Hills location on December 22nd and the Vegas location for Christmas brunch.

VItems selected:\u000a\u000aLemon Meringue Buche Noel\u000aPistachio Macaron\u000aPeppermint Macaron\u000aChocolate Caramel Macchiato Cupcake with Espresso Filling and Salted Caramel Buttercream\u000aKouign Amann\u000a\u000aWith a new strip-side location separated from the casino floor the Venetian/Palazzo complex grew slightly sweeter with the addition of Bouchon Bakery II and although each item at this location is available at the original it should go without saying that more Thomas Keller is never a bad thing.  From traditional croissants to palm-sized macarons and onward to seasonal cakes and pastries designed with the utmost care it is with good fortune that I have been to each and every Bouchon Bakery from coast to coast and brimming with consistency, quality, and finesse the only advice I can offer is this; order whatever sounds best and know it will be textbook, and if you get there early enough to experience the viennoisseries warm from oven the don't miss the Kougin Amann - an exemplary preparation at room temperature but infinitely better with the butter still fluid.

VConvenient to the office and featuring a lovely back room with free Wi-Fi throughout plus a courteous staff I can't say I'm a big fan of their beans or roasting procedures in general but fairing far better than Starbucks in most regards I'm sure I'll find myself here frequently throughout my time in Las Vegas.  Echoing the comments from Nelson and Norm the staff was excellent to us during the first donut meet-up and although my double espresso over ice was rather run of the mill the price was good and the preparation was quick.

VSee profile site for full review with formatted pics.\u000a\u000aChatting on his Vertu in a strange language (something arabic I believe) I couldn't help but notice my neighbor's Constantin Patrimony Series watch flashing in the sunlight of Tableau's patio...clearly there was money around. When the waiter arrived to refill his water and asked if he could get the check the man pulled out a money clip, peeled off two $100 bills and said "that should cover it" before getting up and walking away...the man had ordered a fruit plate. Tucked away in the gardens and pools of the Wynn Tableau is both rich and beautiful in appearance, much like its patrons. Sure I didn't expect low quality from Steve Wynn, but to say the clientele of Tableau was "well to do" would be a vast understatement.\u000a\u000aArriving at 7:45am I was greeted by the gorgeous lobby and the gracious hostess who asked whether I would prefer dining indoors or on the patio. As the patio was amply shaded and most of the patrons were outside I chose the patio and was subsequently offered a copy of the Wallstreet Journal, New York Times, or USA Today to browse. Seeing the headlines regarding the USC upset, I opted for the USA Today (clearly indicating my status compared to the rest of the diners who sat browsing the Times or Journal) and chose a wonderful table half sunny/half shaded with a great view of the pool and gardens. Water was filled and the menu was delivered while the waiter went to get my coffee.\u000a\u000aBrowsing the menu I was instantly captured by the pastry basket and the Peach pancakes, but not being hungry enough for both decided to ask the waiter what was available in the basket. Approximately 10 items were rattled off including an apricot tart, apple scone, and nectarine turnover. When I asked if pastries could be ordered individually it was explained that these were 'petite' pastries and if I wanted to try only one it would be free of charge. "A nectarine turnover and the peach pancakes, please." "Certainly, sir."\u000a\u000aWhile I waited for my food I stood up and roamed the pools and gardens. Approximately 20 people were present at the time, all dressed either business casual or semi-formal and all dining on items ranging from the freshest appearing fruits to pastries to eggs and sausage that looked incredible. When I returned to my table (my tableau?) my coffee was waiting along with cream and sugar/spelda/equal. No nutrasweet was to be seen and when asked I was informed "Mr Wynn does not fancy nutrasweet." Fair enough (for what it is worth, Alex also didn't have Nutrasweet but noted they could obtain it immediately if I desired.)\u000a\u000aAfter approximately 10 minutes a fantastic yet dainty apricot turnover arrived fresh from the oven. Crispy, flaky, loaded with fresh nectarines it was the perfect opener to the meal and I'd have certainly enjoyed many more had I ordered the basket. Another 10 minutes and a laugh at the Trojans passed, my coffee was refilled once, and then my pancakes emerged from the kitchen.\u000a\u000aDescribed in the menu as Ricotta Peach Pancakes with lime butter and organic maple syrup, nothing could've prepared me for these pancakes. Fluffy and light, airy yet moist, sweet yet savory and absolutely jammed with fresh skinned peaches, the dish was presented with a simple dusting of powdered sugar, a side-pitcher of warm syrup, and a dollop on the side that tasted like a fresh key lime dissolved in butter. Having tried Ricotta Pancakes only once before but any number of stellar pancakes in the past, this dish was a revolution and I truly sat and savored each bite. Sure, $14 for three pancakes is not a bargain, but $14 for breakfast bliss? That is a bargain.\u000a\u000aWhen I finished my pancakes and resisted the urge to lick my plate clean my waiter arrived and asked if he could get me anything else. "Perhaps a coffee to go?" "....don't twist my arm....how about another turnover too?" "Certainly, sir." While I didn't tip $185 like my neighbor, I certainly wish I could have.\u000a\u000aOn my way out everyone was very friendly, from the other waiters to the hostess, making each guest feel like their visit was truly valued. I was even invited to return for dinner, but when I told the hostess we had reservations for Alex that evening she noted "oh, excellent choice, perhaps some other time." All told the meal was fantastic and on par with Bouchon in terms of quality, presentation, and service. Go early, sit on the patio, eat, smile, and enjoy the richness of the food and the clientele...even if you yourself aren't rich...sometimes it's fun to see how the upper crust lives.

V....holy cripes is this place expensive.  I have to say I dig the free parking, plush seating, and great screens/sounds, but at $15 per person for a 3d screening for of Wreck-It-Ralph I don't understand how this place is affordable for a family of four - even for myself that seemed outlandish.

VYou'll have to go to the blog for the full scoop - 27 courses is too many to capture here.\u000a\u000aWith expectations tempered given the circumstances but certainly higher than with a traditional "interview" dinner my arrival at Binkley's was timely and finding the couple already present and waiting in the lobby we exchanged pleasantries before reservations were confirmed were quickly led through the spacious dining room to a table just out of view of the kitchen.  With noise moderate and the front-of-house surprisingly smiley and professional yet whimsical and conversant from the moment we arrived I knew we would be in good hands (but little did I know HOW good.)\u000a\u000aSeated at a comfortable four-top it would be mere moments after seating that our captain would greet us and after confirming water choices we were presented with a wine list and menus while the a la carte vs. 4/5/6 course tasting menu option was explained.  With my co-diners having never experienced such a place and with many of the items on the menu rather novel to them we were left to decide and largely allowing them to dictate the pace we settled on the five course tasting...or so we thought as what followed would actually be a twenty-seven "course" three hour and forty five minute rollercoaster ride through the imagination of Chef Binkley and his team.\u000a\u000aA few highlight dishes:\u000a\u000aBrioche Cinnamon Doughnuts with Bacon Butter:  piping hot and minimally greasy they were peerless, particularly when smeared with the umami-savory flavors of hickory smoked bacon.\u000a\u000a"Deep Fried Butter" with Lobster Cream Cheese and Lobster Roe Powder, Chef Binkley's take on Lobster Bisque created by dropping a butter cube into the fryer and subsequently injecting it with the cream cheese before dusting it with roe.  Sweet, creamy, intense and just like the sloppy joe a faithful recreation of the chef's intention...if this were served at the bar I'd go and order a dozen.\u000a\u000aFoie Gras Beignets with White Truffle Cream and Foie Gras Vanilla Milk Shake with Blackberry Swirl and Blackberry Whipped Cream."  Beginning first with the light balls of dough, each with a wispy crumb studded with whole cubes of duck liver torchon these bites were superlative on their own but even more so with the slightly sweet and ethereally aromatic cream.  Taking a bite and then moving to the shake...yes, it was absolutely as good as it sounds - a smooth blend of blackberries and heavy cream with the gossamer of the liver always present yet slightly out of reach.\u000a\u000aEntitled "Crispy seared Foie Gras with apple, raisins, pomegranate, spiced Brazil nuts, popover, chervil" and finished tableside with a spritz (literally from a spritzer) of cinnamon Ice Wine vinegar this preparation of duck liver would arrive as a linear stripe on a square plate and harkening the plating style of Michael Carlson the flavors would also compare favorably as the crackling exterior of the foie gave way to the melting interior and each bite lent itself to a new form of explanation with the accoutrements - most sweet, many smooth, and all interesting; particularly the popover stuffed with a creamy puree of liver, nuts, and aromatic spices.\u000a\u000aFor the next intermezzo all I can call it is a tease - a bit of dining refinement between novelty desserts that absolutely wowed - a two-bite Peanut Butter Souffle with Raspberry Jam every bit as "soufflé" as the sloppy joe was its namesake and along with the foie gras beignet perhaps my favorite bites of a great meal.  Really - if this was offered on the menu I'd have ordered a full sized one in a heartbeat.\u000a\u000aIn the end Binkley's is a place that no matter where it was located would be special and a place that I'll undoubtedly return to with frequency if my career path should indeed land me in the desert long term.

Clearly influenced by his famous space on Waverly Place, both in design and in offerings, but differing slightly in vibe as a dimly lit room with R.E.M. playing gently overhead was complimented by lovely service from a young woman named Kelly our meal began with the staple-amuse of tender, spiced chickpeas on crisp bread and with proper bread service replenished frequently thereafter not a single bite of the food that followed would prove short of exemplary.  Eschewing lighter 'spring' flavors in favor of signatures until later in the meal our first course arrived with creamy pate of pork delivering plenty of spice and sapor while tender tripe compensated for its small portion with textbook texture and complex aromatics - a trend carried over to each $26 plate of pasta; the raviolis averaging approximately $4 each but so delicate, stuffed, and well sauced that it hardly seemed to matter until the plate was wiped spotless with plans to return for the pasta tasting menu swirling my mind.  Transitioning smoothly to things more substantial it would be an exercise in futility to determine whether the rich, caramelized-yet-rare spring lamb over smoky artichoke puree or the nutty roulade of rabbit with flan of carrots was a superior secondi and finishing with dessert both the simple peach presentation and an atypical soufflé-style budino showed the pastry kitchen's prowess - a Babboesque box of petit fours and a double espresso sending us to theater with full bellies and broad smiles.\u000a\u000aObviously prone to complaints of discrepancy in price-to-portion ratio for "Italian food" that many claim to be offered at a better value from their local mom n' pop joint a meal at B&B Ristorante is better taken as a "Fine dining" event rather than any regional cuisine - not only does the sourcing, preparation, and presentation deserve it but so does the service.  Certainly not a cheap meal as the average diner is unlikely to exit for less than a Benjamin suffice it to say that for a 'celebrity chef' meal on The Strip B&B delivers where many mail it in, a similar sentiment applicable to Palazzo's Carnevino, though the latter is ever so slightly a better 'experience.'

VWhile I cannot comment on the pros and cons of this space as a soccer venue or as a park with swings and the like I can say that with the impressive maintenance, clean roller hockey rinks with NHL style cages, and excellent jogging paths I will definitely be spending more time here over the coming months.  Located just down the street from my temporary housing situation as I wait to complete a purchase in Summerlin I admit that I haven't become familiar with many Las Vegas parks yet, but if this is any indication I am excited to do so.

Obviously not brought up on "Soul Food" but raised close enough to Detroit that it played a big part in childhood memories I've since sought out, those looking for collards, chitlins, or gumbo should be aware that none are available before noon on weekends (despite the online annotated 11am,) nor is fried chicken beyond the wing (though if you ask nicely they may be able to accommodate after a substantial delay...IE, the thigh arrived with dessert,)  and moving past these inconveniences be advised that service, while friendly, is constrained - a pair of young ladies and an elderly fellow managing a capacity crowd of ~80 with wait times up to an hour during my stay.  Moving past the 'issues' and onto the food and décor suffice it to say that the interior replicates the façade and with a small kitchen at work behind makeshift walls the food arrived at an awkward pace with mixed results, particularly in the proteins where both pork chop and breast were dry and flavorless despite excellent, crispy breading while the thigh was expectedly more succulent but also far better seasoned, as if from an entirely different batch.  Speaking to the rest, mostly carbs and a pair of over easy eggs, it was in these items that M&M shined - the waffles a soft wheat batter and the 'cornbread' a pair of pan fried flapjacks needing only a touch of syrup to balance the savory notes, something neither the sweet potato pie nor the banana pudding would require at all - the former a well done classic and the second far more dense than any take on the dish I've found and all the better for it, a sort of bread pudding made with only a bit of liquid and a lot of ripe bananas juxtaposing softened nilla wafers.

VIf every Fry's was like this one I'd frequent them more often.  Between the covered parking, bulk selection, and good prices I personally think they are better than the Whole Foods down the street for staple items and while their prices are higher for some of the esoterics that actually helps in my case to prevent me from buying more oils, vinegars, spices, etc that will sit in my cupboard indefinitely.  \u000a\u000aEmployees are friendly, the store itself is nearly spotless, and it is within walking distance of my current residence.  No complaints.  None at all.

VCompared to previous experiences with Jiffy Lube this one was actually quite pleasant - no long lines, efficient employees, no 'upsell,' and a Television with working volume controls in the lobby.  Interestingly one of THREE independent former Ohioans in the lobby while I waited (3/4 people - what are the odds) we talked about the Buckeyes while our respective cars were drained, lubed, vacuumed, and given a 20 point check by the staff and thirty minutes later I was back on the road; for me that is worth paying a few bucks more - though the synthetic blend at JL is still the same price as full synthetic at Valvoline back in Ohio.

VReally excellent customer service and a great selection of things that I don't particularly "need," but definitely want for my home.  Far less expensive than places like Restoration Hardware and Pottery Barn with a selection I generally prefer I get the idea that as a new home owner I'm due to spend a bit of time and money here.

V...recently my interview travels would take me to Phoenix/Scottsdale, a place I'd never really considered before, but a place with a job that just seemed "right" and a number of fellow gourmands, foodies, and chow-hounds who really reached out with their recommendations and offers to meet up for meals - a great group, each and every one.  With days jammed packed this short trip would actually prove to be a little tricky in planning but after getting a general feel for the local logistics the restaurants fell into place nicely with breakfast, lunch, and dinner planned strategically each day along with a few snacks.  Beginning first with breakfast, just as my trip did, there were three proper sit down breakfasts in The Valley and the first took place less than an hour after I hopped of the plane at The Farm at South Mountain.\u000a\u000aWith bags packed light and my car easily obtained the drive to Morning Glory Café would be a straight forward 15 minutes from Sky Harbor Airport and arriving at the large farm I proceeded down the gravel path through gardens of streaming sunlight that I quite simply did not expect to see in the "desert."  With signs delineating the location of the café (and the oft raved Quiescence next door) parking was found under a shady tree and checking the thermostat, 87 degrees Fahrenheit at 8:45am) I hopped out of the car and walked down the path to the restaurant only to find the patio approximately 1/3 full.  Greeted promptly by a thin young woman and subsequently by the elderly gentleman who would be my server I was told to "sit anywhere you like."\u000a\u000aSelecting a seat in the shade as my pale Midwestern complexion certainly was not ready for an hour in the Arizona sun it would be mere moments before Cliff would stop by with the menu and a bucket of condiments to inform me of the daily pastry special and to ask if I had any questions.  Requesting a coffee I was informed that the coffee, water, and tea are all "help yourself" and suggesting I'd need a minute to browse the menu I was told to take my time.  \u000a\u000aWith the menu concise but full of excellent choices largely consisting of locally sourced meats and organic produce I spent a few moments weighing my decision and with my choices made I motioned to Cliff who stopped by to take my order and warn me "you'd better be hungry" before departing for the kitchen.  Undeterred by his warning I next proceeded to the coffee stand where biodegradable cups and lids were provided for both water and coffee and after getting a cup of each I returned to my seat where I sipped the thin and mildly acidic locally roasted Café Cortez coffee while awaiting my appetizer.\u000a\u000aPrebaked but still warm, the first item to arrive at my table would be the pastry of the day - a Blueberry Muffin nearly the size of my fist and bespeckled with crystals of cane sugar.  First tasting the muffin as it was and then gilding the proverbial lily with salted California Dairies butter the muffin would prove to be quite impressive in its density but also in its fluffiness as the medium-size blueberries burst with flavor within the buttermilk batter with tinges of cinnamon tickling the palate.\u000a\u000aWith coffee refilled and a short wait as the patio filled another pair of tables with locals (and regulars judging by the greeting) Cliff would arrive perhaps twenty minutes after I was seated with the main course - the "Farm Monte Cristo" consisting of two thick slices of fluffy rustic French Toast sandwiched around slow baked local ham, two over easy eggs, and melting cheddar cheese.  Apparently expecting me to be overwhelmed by the size Cliff offered me a "good luck and bon appetite" before stepping away and with that I set out to douse the amalgam with warm organic maple syrup and take a bite; a bite that more or less redefined the Monte Cristo for all time as the bread was not the least bit oily but rather light and fluffy with a nearly croissant textured interior and slight yeasty notes mellowed by the syrup and the powdered sugar. Moving next to the ham-young, fresh, lean, and salty - and then the sharp cheddar and creamy eggs the flavor was in a word "perfect;" salty, sweet, creamy, crunchy, and at the same time surprisingly light.  It was not only the best breakfast item I had in Phoenix, but the best sandwich I've had in a very long time.\u000a\u000aWith Cliff returning surprised that I'd finished the meal and offering me a "good job" I joked (well, not really joked as I really did go for pastry and pizza afterward) that the sandwich "wasn't that big, but it was THAT good" and thanking him for the service I requested the tab while getting yet another coffee to enjoy while I checked my mail and another cup to go.  Noting now that the experience of such a great sandwich, setting, and service is not "cheap" ($23 with tax and tip) I can say without a doubt that if I do end up in Phoenix long term Cliff will not make the mistake of underestimating my capacity again because without a doubt I'll be a regular.

Arriving early to find the store empty save for a couple undergoing a wedding cake consultation in the side room it was to a duo of clerks that I arrived and with the head baker bringing items fresh from the back the aroma was intoxicating even before I was gifted a soft piece of cake and a dipped cat's tongue cookie - the rest taken to go and consumed in part before, and in part after lunch.  Speaking first to the cookies, free thanks to a Yelp check-in, aside from the two small bars it was to servers that I deferred and with each good and the Marzipan outstanding I had high expectations for the rest, only the slightly 'dry' Red Velvet anything less than impressive - the Wedding Cake Slice far better than any special occasion cake I've been subjected to with supple layers of cream surrounding soft vanilla cake, and the warm crispy chocolate roll speckled in Belgian-style pearl sugar a well-layered and buttery delight, far better than any 'pain au chocolate' I've found stateside to date.

VFast, efficient, and friendly when a load of no-shows made my Tuesday morning clinic anything but rapid I cannot complain at all about the quality of service at this Supercuts nor about the music selection during my wait - Aerosmith's Home Sweet Home, Black Sabbath's NIB, and The Who's Love Reign O'er Me.  Cleanly and $15 for a trim I guess I'm glad to be low maintenance in this regard...even if the end result was my 1:00pm pt suggesting I don't look old enough to be her doctor.

VI miss Panera - coming from the midwest and currently calling Phoenix home we have "Paradise Bakery" but it just isn't the same; too much hip-hop on the stereo while Panera focuses on a more chill vibe.  Decent Coffee, comfortable seating, and friendly servers - yet another reason I'll be happy to be migrating north to Las Vegas very soon.

On the way back we realized the bus was $2, but took about 90 minutes.\u000a\u000aCan't say I regretted the trip to Old Vegas, but it is definitely better at night.  Certainly a great choice for those doing things on a budget or those simply wanting to people watch.\u000a\u000aSure, Alex has Blue Lobster and Foie Gras.....but does he have deep fried oreos?  Freemont Street does!  :-)

VItems Selected:\u000aGarlic Knots\u000aFried Gnocchi\u000aNeapolitan Rice Ball\u000aMargarita Sicilian - Fresh Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce, Fresh Basil\u000aWhite Pizza - Ricotta, Romano, Mozzarella, Italian Spices\u000aRicotta Canolli\u000a\u000aLocated in a small complex just steps off the UNLV campus and part of my regular workday walking route Cugino's Italian Deli had long been on my "to do" list; a Saturday afternoon visit with two friends proving the rumors of pricy yet good East Coast Italian classics to be quite accurate.  Small in size and curt in customer service it was with admitted indecision that our group approached the Cugino's counter and ordering on-the-fly a six-part meal emerged, the $66 meal presented in four courses with plenty of leftovers and mostly impressive results.  Undoubtedly a red sauce joint despite a multitude of housemade salads and sandwiches it was with fried pillows of ricotta gnocchi that the meal began and with each creamy morsel crispy on the exterior but virtually oilless I was immediately impressed - a trend continued in the tender rice ball buried in house-pulled mozzarella and tangy marinara.  Obviously prone to over-ordering, particularly in small groups, our trio next doubled down on a pair of pies and while the thin white pie proved somewhat bland to my tastes with a mundane crust tinged with semolina the Sicilian dazzled as fresh mozzarella formed soft puddles amidst aromatic tomato sauce bright with acid and appropriately devoid of sugar.  Breezing through a plate of golden garlic knots aggressively seasoned with its namesake herb and kissed with butter before finishing the meal with pre-filled canolli already experiencing some sog it was with a bit of disappointment that I was informed neither house-made rainbow cookies nor tiramisu were available outside the freezer but with stomachs full and leftovers boxed as conversation flowed it would be hard to say I regretted much...except perhaps neglecting the tripe soup or eponymous Cugino's Special sandwich, both on the short 'there's always next time' list, though a repeat trek to similar-but-better Montesano's will most certainly come first.

VCool mall with a unique design and a great balance of high end and medium tier stores.  Diesel, Teavana, B&O, Saks, Neiman, Nordstrom, Macy's, etc.  Even at the expensive stores throwing away your money feels better than losing it on the tables......though not quite as good as blowing it on a big meal somewhere stellar.\u000a\u000aThe fashion show every hour is kind of humorous, as well, and the airconditioning is freezing.  \u000a\u000aA nice 'break' in the non-stop flashing lights and gourmet (or gorging buffet fest, if thats your thing) dining of Vegas.

VWatches, Cheese, Chocolates, Banks, Mountains...and leather goods - who'd have guessed the Swiss are pretty excellent at that as well.  High detail, hand made, exquisite customer service, and quality that matches the admittedly exorbitant price tag - from belts and bags to boots and shoes it wouldn't be difficult in the least to drop a few months mortgage on a whim in Bally, but having kept my eyes on a particular pair of loafers for nearly 3 months when the time finally came for a sale they were mine in all their buttery soft hand stitched glory.  Generally fancying Cole Haan or Ferragamo as my work shoes of choice suffice it to say that the craftsmanship at Bally is truly a work of art on par with the best in the industry and for those with the means their goods represent refined luxury without all the labeling and posturing of Louis Vuitton or Gucci, a rarity in a market where it seems everyone else wants to be emblazoned with a tag saying 'hey, look at me.'

Prices trend a bit higher than some of the other chain salons in the area but I've been quite pleased with my last three visits here in all but one regard - the horrendous pop-music playing far too loudly.  Never faced by more than a fifteen minute wait for a walk-in and with my bank, post office, and Smith's just down the way suffice it to say I'll be a regular here as long as I live in Las Vegas.

VI'm not a chocolate snob by any justification....as a matter of fact, I admittedly don't know much at all about chocolate aside from the pseudoscience behind the ORAC of dark chocolate.....but I know what tastes good and the chocolate at Vosges tastes amazing.\u000a\u000aI was shopping for a gift for my mother and aunt to go along with the items I'd picked up at Payard and Jean-Philippe and as I'd heard good things about Vosges from a friend in NYC I decided to check it out.\u000a\u000aJulie, the saleswoman was incredibly helpful in assisting my decision without placing any sales pressure whatsoever.  Considering the prices of the truffles (ranging $2.50-$3.00) I was definitely suprised when the woman offered me a freebie of the Tian Nacu truffle - Mexican Vanilla Bean, Venezuelan 65% dark, and a small piece of gogi berry bar.  Both were fantastic.  I was even more suprised when I asked questions about other options and was given free sample truffles of the Balsamico - 12 year Modena balsamic, 65% Dark, Sicilian Hazelnuts as well as the Rooster - Taleggio cheese, organic walnut, Tahitian Vanilla Bean, 64% Dark Chocolate.  $8 worth of free Chocolate in Vegas?  Nice!  I'd like to think it was my charming personality or stunning good looks, but I'll just assume they do this for everyone.\u000a\u000aRegardless, both the cheese and the vinegar truffles were amazing and I additionally had a small taste of the Moe's Bacon Bar before making my purchase.\u000a\u000aHad I not just eaten at Payard I'd have likely picked up a cookie, brownie, or hot chocolate as all looked delectable, and I'll definitely be ordering their Red Velvet cake for someone's special event sometime.\u000a\u000aOrganic does not mean healthy, but like anything else of high quality, Vosges is safe in small doses and absolutely fantastic.  True Innovation is tough to find, but I'd say Vosges does it right and the service was stellar.\u000a\u000aWays to 5 stars (and a man's heart....or at least mine?)  Free desserts!  :-)

VSee profile site for full review with formatted pics.\u000a\u000aFor myself, the focus was the food and the evening unfolded as follows:\u000a\u000a"Amuse Bouche" - eggplant Caviar w/tuna picatta, crispy chip - A small blend of tender eggplant and spicy tuna plus a crispy round for dipping, this was a wonderful taste to begin the evening.  Barely spicy with hints of tomato and basil, the texture was like a creamy tuna salad without the mayo.\u000a\u000aDish 1:  KAMPACHI SASHIMI, GREEN CURRY EMULSION, SEAWEED SALAD - Perfect Kampachi with a fairly mild flavor, yet delectably enhanced by the green curry this dish was quite attractive and a good followup to the tuna.  As good as the fish was, however, the seaweed salad was incredible and my only complaint could possibly be that there wasn't ten times as much.  Then again, had I known how much food was to come I'd have known better.\u000a\u000aDish 2:  TENDER POTATO GNOCCHI, FRESH MORELS & ASPARAGUS WITH VEAL JUICE AND FLAKED PARMESAGNA - Knowing my feelings about Gnocchi, this dish was a part of the reason I'd selected MiX in the first place.  Unlike Thomas Keller's buttery Parisian version, Ducasse opts here to utilize the Italian formula of simple and tender potato dumplings with just a little salt and complements from the dense and woody flavor of perfectly tender Morels and flawlessly crisp asparagus.  The veal juice and parmesagna added a salty and savory component to the dish.  While not the best gnocchi ever, the texture and flavor were sublime and I'd certainly re-order on return visits.\u000a\u000aDish 3:  MACADAMIA/PISTACHIO CRUSTED HALIBUT, ASPARAGUS CREAM, PARMESAN FOAM - The show stealer for my friend and a solid frontrunner for best-fish-dish-ever for myself, it is hard to describe the delicate nuisances of this dish without experiencing it.  Perfectly poached fish with a crunchy yet sweet and nutty coating bisected a plate with asparagus and creamy asparagus cream on one side and a cheesy foam on the other side.  While each flavor was superb separately, the combination was even more stunning with the cream and foam drizzled over the fish.  A second dish featuring asparagus and parmesan, it is easy to see why Ducasse serves these two dishes back to back frequently and I cannot recommend the combination enough.  In a weekend that featured tasting menu fish preparations by Le Cirque and Alex as well, this may have been the best fish dish of all, and that is saying something.\u000a\u000aDish 4:  ROASTED MAINE LOBSTER "AU CURRY", COCONUT BASMATI RICE, PINEAPPLE, RAISIN, AND PEARL ONIONS - Quite frankly I've no idea what Ducasse was thinking when he prepared this dish the first time, but the thought it was certainly inspired by a muse or a God.  To be fair, the curry was understated so anyone ordering this for heat will be disappointed.....I didn't order for heat.  What I ordered it for was a fantastically prepared lobster served over sweet sticky rice and complimented by roasted onions and sweet fruits.  While not quite as mind-blowing as the Lobster at Alex (which may be my favorite dish of all time,) this is the second best Lobster preparation I've ever experienced and it will haunt my dreams until I find a means to prepare it myself.\u000a\u000aDish 5:  ROASTED DUCK BREAST, BLACK MISSION FIG, RADISH & BABY TURNIPS, FIG SAUCE - My first substitution and absolutely worth the choice.  A well cooked yet juicy duck breast, skin on and perforated for complete cooking, the meat was not gamey at all and the earthy/meaty texture was wonderfully offset by the figs and fig sauce, yet given a crispy textural component by the radish and turnips.  While the "worst" of the dishes in my opinion, the competition was pretty stiff and that is no disrespect at all.   \u000a\u000aPalate Cleanser:  PASSIONFRUIT AND MANGO SORBET WITH COCONUT LIME FOAM - Served in a Martini glass, I believe the phrase palate cleanser was invented for this dish.  I don't even like Mango and this item impressed me.  \u000a\u000aDessert:  BABA AU RHUM, MONTE CARLO STYLE WITH SPICED RUM AND CRÈME ANGLAIS - While I'm not a drinker, I am a fan of rum cake and rank Mastro's Buttercake amongst my all time favorite desserts.  A small cake was served along with a pot of rum and a second pot of crème which was then reconstructed by the waiter tableside, first pouring a little rum and then a dollop of cream with further customization allowed.  While not QUITE as good as Mastros, the dish was a beautiful compliment to the meal and left a warm feeling in my belly for the rest of the night.\u000a\u000aMadelines :  To cap off the meal we were served four of Ducasse's signature Madelines straight from the piping hot pan along with warm Nutella.  While I realize the tradition of the Madeline has been carried on by both Stratta and Boulud, it is my understanding that Ducasse was first and though I've not tried Daniel's, Ducasse's option blew Alex's out of the water.  Moist, creamy, delicate, and perfect with the Nutella.

VTwo visits now under my belt, one on a lazy Saturday and the other during First Fridays and I'm confident to say that Trifecta is my favorite independent gallery in Las Vegas.  Always an interesting display and often featuring works that the beginning or intermediate art collector can afford I particularly enjoyed the recent 10th Anniversary show, a collection of local favorites beautifully curated and arranged to tell a story greater than a simple sum of its parts.  To those who complain of Vegas' lack of culture, sure it isn't New York or Los Angeles, but with galleries like Trifecta and the rest of the Arts Factory I can say it is a heckuva a lot better than other similarly sized cities like Columbus, or larger metropolises such as Phoenix.

VLocated in Boca Park and clearly using loose pricing schemes and hushed talk to pay the excessive rent there is not much positive I can say about Shoe Lab, other than perhaps that they do a good job at making a buck.  Keeping my 'experience' brief, I contacted the store to inquire about the cost of replacing a 1/4 inch loop of brown leather on a pair of double monk straps and was told I'd have to bring the item in for "assessment" - a quick visual inspection by the clerk leading to hushed discussion with the craftsman who very obviously looked both me and the brand over before quoting the random price of $35...$10 more than he'd just quoted a woman before me to replace a worn heel on a beaten up pair of Steve Maddens.  Chuckling at this price and suggesting I'd look elsewhere it was with little surprise that the clerk sprang to action suggesting a "special" price of $25 without consulting her boss - an obvious indication that the former price was based on the label more than the workload and plenty of incentive for me to walk out, taking my business elsewhere.\u000a\u000aAdmittedly noting that their selection of shoe care products is on par with some of the higher end locations in the city it seems reasonable to assume that the quality of worksmanship is high but never one to support shady business practices I can't say I'm in any rush to affirm the veracity of that assumption.

VIf I've learned anything in Rental Cars over recent years it is that you get what you pay for and although Hertz is more costly than other nationally branded rental companies the cars are always new, always clean, and always ready on time.  Not QUITE as well rounded an experience as I've had with National I'm very comfortable with Hertz and would gladly use them again whether in Vegas or elsewhere.

VItems Selected\u000aStrawberry Fluffy Snow with Mochi, Egg Pudding, and Condensed Milk\u000aCaramel Milk Tea with Boba\u000a\u000aStill sated despite the fact that dinner had ended nearly three hours prior but in a celebratory mood after The Kings Double-OT stunner in Game 2 of The Stanley Cup Finals it was largely a matter of convenience that led me to Easy Life Boba Tea, the small storefront a resident of my 'to do' list ever since a January visit to now-shuttered 9 on the Plate.  Purportedly open until 10:00pm on Saturdays but seemingly abandoned with chairs atop tables on my arrival it was not until I hollered "Hello" that a small woman emerged from the back and although quick to explain in a deterrent tone that orders after 9:30 were only offered to go I not only persisted but also doubled down, a yelp check-in shaving 50% off my second item with a total tally of $8.54 for an order taken curbside to enjoy.  Admittedly a novice but happy to experiment at such a low cost it was with sips of Easy Life's caramel flavored milk tea that my tasting began and with pearls of boba channeling up the thick straw amidst creamy liquid only modestly sweet I was modestly surprised, an opinion even more befitting a container of summer-fresh fluffy snow far lighter than that at Snowflake Shavery finding textural counterpoints in dense egg custard, whimsical mochi, and a light drizzle of condensed milk...the only bad taste of the evening delivered as I walked back to my car only to see a group of four Asian twenty-somethings seated at a table inside eating fluffy snow with the same young server who'd just sent me to the streets.

VThis is a review of Pliner's approach and style (truly original, but certainly "not for everyone,) this location, and especially their sales person - Milijana, or Mia as she introduced herself.  Making my purchase on 12/18 during their holiday sale I literally tried on 25 pairs of shoes before making my final selection - a half-lacquered pair of black suede shoes unlike anything I've previously seen.\u000a\u000aWhile the store did not have my size in stock, Mia brought me shoes made from the same mold and informed me that not only could the size I need (11) be mailed to my home, but it could be accomplished with no tax and free shipping since I lived in Ohio.\u000a\u000aIn retrospect I wish I'd have bought more pairs of shoes while I was there, but as it stands they've guaranteed I'll return on my next Vegas visit.

VItems Selected:\u000aCoffee and Water\u000aSnow Caps - Butter fried bagel slices, cinnamon sugar\u000aThe Ultimate - Texas Toast soaked in English Toffee Batter, topped with Pecans, Caramel, and Powdered Sugar\u000aHomerun French Toast - Graham Cracker Peanut Butter Sandwiches dipped in Reeses Peanut Butter Batter topped with Bananas, Powdered Sugar, and Grape Jelly Reduction\u000aBanana Cream Pancakes - Pancakes infused with banana syrup and bananas, topped with pecans and served with dulce de leche whipped cream butter \u000a\u000aLocated just off the 215 in the southeast part of town I'd long been looking for a reason to visit Original Sunrise Café and with the Art Festival of Henderson scheduled for Mother's Day weekend I finally decided to make the trek, my reward a good meal at a fair price with sterling service from beginning to end.  As much a "mom n' pop" spot as any in Las Vegas it was 7:05am when I walked in the café door and with smiley greetings amidst the sunbathed room I quickly found a seat, a full view of the kitchen plus the NFL Draft my amusement as I navigated the two-page laminated menu with the first of several cups of coffee in hand.  Always trending sweet over savory it was with gluttony followed by glee that I inquired about half-portions or short-stacks and informed that both could be accommodated it was a quartet that comprised my order, the signature "Snow Caps" of sliced bagels fried in butter under a dusting of cinnamon sugar soon delighting me in its simplicity as I watched the restaurant fill.  Ever gracious in service as java flowed free a pair of pancakes arrived next and although improved by creamy dulce de leche the cakes themselves lacked, a mistake thankfully not replicated in either of the French Toasts, The Ultimate a more traditional version with buttery bread soaked in toffee and caramel while the Homerun can best be described as a battered after-school snack griddled to soft and topped with fresh bananas plus grape jam - a concept as simple as the Snow Caps and every bit as worth getting out of bed early for.

V...if price were no object I'd likely have a closet full of Armani and Varvatos; one for the classics and one for the modern - yet with that said, the Emporio line of the Armani empire is not too shabby at all in the men's modern section, either.  Clean lines, great fits, incredible stitch work - pricey, but truly tailored.

VIn a rush and too focused on all my dining and hockey plans I completely neglected to bring my cell-phone charger to Vegas.  After stopping at the Verizon Kiosk and being offered the obsurd price of $49.95 (ITS A PLUG!) and another failed attempt at the cellular store, I swung into Brookstone and found a 4-style charger (Wall, Car, USB, 9V Battery) that worked perfectly for $35.  One star off for the dopey salesman trying to sell me a BoB clock, however.

VAttended the Art Festival of Henderson here and must say I was immensely underwhelmed; no shade, limited selection, and a poor layout all coalescing into one of the worst art shows I've been to in years.  Admittedly well traveled amongst both regional and national art festivals the Henderson iteration would be best termed a craft show and although prices were appropriate to the quality of the art there was not much worth having made the drive.  Fine for locals but inappropriately hyped by the local papers I'm rather certain one can find a better way to celebrate than this " Mother's Day tradition."

VIn a world where everyone always wants (perhaps justifiably so) to get paid for every little thing they do I cannot help but strongly praise the service I received at Morgan Taylor - for free.  Recently had a watch serviced by the manufacturer in preparation for making another new purchase soon and as part of that had some links in the old watch placed for cleaning.  Having now decided to hold onto the old watch and thus needing the aforementioned links removed I called Morgan Taylor up and was told they could do the work 'while I wait,' something two other dealers (including Tourneau in the Forum Shops) could not promise and when I showed up they did it for free, despite my offer to pay.  Apparently also offering custom work, repair, and jewelry ranging from the $50 up I'll definitely be back for minor repairs, though hopefully few and far between.

VSee Blog for full review:  \u000a\u000aArriving first, my contorti dish consisted of 8 large figs "agrodolce" cured in balsamic vinegar - at only $6 the dish was a steal and tasted wonderful with the sweetness of the figs proving a substantial match for the sour and acidic vinegar.  No pits, no stems, soft flesh and crispness to the skin - all told, excellent.\u000a\u000aWaiting only a short time my next arrival was the salad - or at least the dish listed as a salad.  Entitled Due Uova the plate was certainly overpriced at $14 but the taste/flavor certainly made up for it.  Featuring a creamy and rich risotto cake flash fried and filled with cheese the dish was next topped with a farm fresh hen-egg served sunny side and then accented with an ample portion of mullet bottarga - hence the "two eggs."  Textural and rich the dish shined despite its price tag and once again showed off Batali's skill with eggs.\u000a\u000aArriving next was my pizza and fried item.  First off, Zucchini Blossoms with Picorino Fritti consisted of five flavorful and lightly fried blossoms loaded with a zesty pecorino that melted just enough to give contrast.  Light and sweet to complement the savory cheese, the blossoms were actually more fragrant that I was used to and had a great "aftertaste" that lingered on the palate.\u000a\u000aFinishing the blossoms I suddenly realized just how large the pizzas were and knowing I A) needed to spend $50 to use my certificate, B) wanted dessert, and C) had the previously mentioned dinner in a few hours I decided to only eat half the pizza - a half that turned into 4/6 of the pizza plus all of the toppings from the remaining slices after a couple bites.  Featuring a perfect and buttery cracker crust topped with pulled Ham hock, braised Endive, ricotta, and mozzarella the pizza was stated to be a daily special and it was incredible - possibly the best pizza I've had in a couple of years.  Smoky and savory yet sweet the ham was wonderfully tender while the crispy endive proved a nice foil with its mildly pungent tones.  The blend of cheeses worked well to accent the toppings without overwhelming, something I've found Batali's team particularly skilled at in past experiences.\u000a\u000aAllowing my servers to clear the table (at this point inexplicably still holding the plates of every dish I'd consumed) and to finally refill my water (only 1 refill during the 70 minute meal) I watched the "Street performers" while awaiting my dessert.  Feeling somewhat full I decided against the "dessert du jour" - profiteroles, and instead opted for one of Enoteca's signature gelato sundaes - Concord Grape Sorbetto, Peanut Butter Gelato, Peanut Butter Cookie, frozen Concord Grapes.  Presented beautifully with a small gelato trowel I proceeded to crumble up the cookie and take a taste.  First impressed by the incredibly "grape-like" flavor of the sorbet and its tart almost wine-like aroma I next took a bite of the smooth and creamy gelato - literally like a blend of butter and peanut butter but cold.  Finally, mixing the two - heaven - like the best peanut butter and jelly you've never had.  \u000a\u000aWhen it was all said and done my total bill came out to $57, or $35ish including my certificate - quite frankly, a steal for a Batali meal and especially in such a unique setting.  While clearly not as "refined" as Babbo or Mozza, I actually liked the atmosphere and food at Enoteca much more than that at Otto - I also didn't have to wait for 2 hours for a seat.  While service could have been better and prices perhaps slightly lower on the due uova, nothing was out of line and I'd certainly consider returning to Enoteca San Marco for a casual lunch on future visits to Vegas.  Say what you will about Mario - the man does great things with cheese, pork, and eggs

VOnce you get past the disorganized and confusing shit show that is their shopping mall Planet Hollywood is actually an interesting casino with a great open floor plan to the gaming area and plenty of unique areas to explore.  Featuring plenty of entertainment options and venues plus a few eateries worth checking out plus one of the more spacious parking structures on the central strip I think pH and the Miracle Mile Shops provide an intermediate between the low and the high of Vegas, the sort of place where there is something for everyone but at the same time nothing in particular worth 'seeking out.'

VItems Selected:\u000a\u000aCoffee\u000aBread Pudding\u000aBlueberry Bagel with Blueberry Cream Cheese\u000aGriddled (on request) Pecan Roll\u000aRainbow Cookies\u000aChallah French Toast\u000aRugulah (Blueberry, Apricot Raisin, Raspberry, Lemon Coconut, Apple Cinnamon)\u000a\u000aFailing to understand North America's fascination with the bagel despite repeated attempts ranging from New York to Montreal it was admittedly with little surprise that I'd not heard of The Bagel Café prior to its mention in a conversation about local pastry but with a convenient location and breakfast menu loaded with personal favorites I knew it would not be long before gave Savvas Andrews' New York styled shop a chance to shine.  A part of the local community since 1995, with a bakery plus deli up front and full service kitchen behind, it was just prior to the restaurant's 7am opening that I arrived and with a small line of regulars already awaiting entry it was not long before we were ushered in - many heading straight for their bagels and pastries to-go while the rest found a seat amidst friendly, if not overly attentive service that often left coffee empty and empty plates to pile.  A sizable menu with knishes, latkes, and matzo brei that will warrant a return it was with a bagel that my meal began and opting for a selection sliced and toasted I'll simply reference my statement above and say that for once "I got it;" a light crunch over supple center pairing light eggy tones with fresh blueberries and only improved by rich housemade cream cheese.  Moving from good to better, both the enormous pecan roll as well as eggy house baked challah were beautifully presented after a quick treatment on the buttered griddle and although I'd have preferred to see the French Toast offered with pure maple syrup (even if at an additional charge) this is a small quibble for what may be the best simple or 'traditional' French Toast I've had in recent memory, particularly with a portion big enough to share.  Last but not least, a limited sampling of the baked goods yielded a quintet of toothsome rugulah - all textbook - plus a final surprise I've not seen in ages; a rich half-pound slab of traditional Vanilla and Cinnamon Bread Pudding with the day-old Challah soaked in sweet milk overlying a near-savory custard base strewn with raisins, each layer delicious on its own but combining to form something wholly satisfying both cold at the counter and all the more so when warmed up later that evening.

V...sketchy and overpriced, odd smelling and poorly managed - but walkable from the strip and a decent sound system plus large screens and a good matinee price for Django Unchained on Christmas Day 2012 while waiting for my family to arrive.  Can't say I'd frequent the place, but it sufficed in a pinch.

VI've been to a number of Teavana shops in various cities.....this one is the best.  Twelve different flavors were available for sampling on my last visit and amongst them was the heavenly Silver Needle white as well as the Sweet Lily White.\u000a\u000aGreat service and a new favorite blend (Jasmine Dragon with Phoenix Pearls) made this a great stop on a long day of mall browsing.

Generally not particularly interested in buffets given the lackluster quality of ingredients plus intrinsic flaws related to large-scale production and hot plates it was with good faith that I presumed a team the likes of that at Wing Lei would do a stellar job with sourcing as well as preparation and true to form from the moment our party of three arrived it would be hard to find fault in any aspect of the afternoon as the setting, food, and service shined.  A no reservations affair playing host to a mixture of young and old, Asian and Caucasian, it was with dim sum that the majority of tables began and with carts circulating at intervals of no more than ten minutes each and every item arrived hot and fresh, the offerings shining with delicate shark's fin, snappy lobster, and textbook har gow amongst the most impressive steamed items while fried taro root dumplings, juicy XLB, and crispy duck plus pork belly with a crackling crème brulee skin also wowed.  Moving next to the vast expanse of items both hot and cold, it was in the soup station that I found two of my favorites - the congee as rich and textural as the bisque proved buttery and sweet (if not particularly Chinese at all) - while split 1.5lb lobsters, King Crab Claws, and prepared to order sushi was all immaculate, an easy place for those so inclined to more than make up for the cost of entry.  Focusing less on steam-tray hot items but very impressed by cured duck balanced by sliced pears, fatty yet supple Tomahawk chop, and tender grilled scallops, meaty sea bass, plus lobster salad in delicate ponzu it was at last to desserts that I moved and sampling each one of the sweets it would be difficult to say which I enjoyed the most as the dense caramel coffee crunch and coconut lychee financier were as good as any similar dessert served on the strip, yet given the choice to revisit just one item it was to the Yuzu Cheesecake dipped in White Chocolate that I returned - the creamy center with light citrus and a smooth chocolate shell redefining a dessert I rarely, if ever, order on a restaurant menu.  Undoubtedly a decadent brunch but also a case where I feel I got exactly what I paid for suffice it to say I can't wait for the Year of the Sheep...and more exploration of Vegas' wide selection of Asian cuisines, both casual and upscale, in the interim.

VBest idea ever; get me away from the terminal, give me competent employees and a garage that is intrinsically laid out, and get me on the road.  While some may not NEED a car in Las Vegas, if you do need one this is just about the most intelligent way to streamline the process that I can think of.

Featuring all the 'standards' of a modern American bakery with options ranging from simple cupcakes and cookies to more fanciful macarons and choux-based options plus croissants and cinnamon rolls that did not even *appear* appetizing it was a wide swath of the menu that I was able to sample given a collection of petit fores, but almost across the board every single item was simply 'sweet' with indistinct flavors and off-textures - soggy choux, dry cake, and cloying cooked frostings the biggest offenders.  Focusing on the few items that at least worked in parts, the red velvet far outdid the funfetti and 'breakfast' options by presenting moist cake and tangy cream cheese frosting while both tarts, though far too sweet to let natural fruits shine, presented a respectable buttery crust that in more restrained hands could produce a great seasonal pie.   Speaking last to macarons, the general quality of most I've tasted in Las Vegas lacking, I would strongly recommend those preferring jam based centers take a look here as both cookies featured good crackle giving way to a quickly dissipating crumb over intense filling, the apple again a bit saccharine but the strawberry like an early bite of summer...two great bites amidst a $25 tab quoted off the top of the clerk's head without any listed prices or detailed receipt, none of it a reason to return even given the proximity as I've produced better versions of all but the macarons in my own kitchen.

A cute shop, though the exterior signage could certainly use work, it isn't quite La Grande Orange, Scratch, or Essence but Bertha's is still very good and with a few truly standout items I certainly need to make a return visit to further investigate.

VItems Selected:\u000aMad About Vanilla - Vanilla Cake, Vanilla Filling, Vanilla Frosting\u000aSnickerdoodle - Cinnamon and Vanilla Cake, Vanilla Frosting, Cinnamon Sugar\u000aWascally Wabbit - Carrot Cake, Orange Filling, Cream Cheese Frosting\u000aClassic Red Velvet - Red Velvet Cake, Vanilla Filling, Cream Cheese Frosting\u000a\u000aLocated on Grand Canyon Parkway though not particularly easy to spot from the street it was the good word of mouth from a trusted source that led me to Page Pszanowski's Mad Hatter Cupcakes and putting a made-to-order spin on the tried-and-true trend the results were nearly as smile inducing as the cutesy décor.  Small and narrow with a few seats stashed beneath the Wonderland inspired theme a visit to Mad Hatter begins with greetings from the smiling staff and with several cakes, fillings, frostings, and toppings from which to build the options expand by exponentials; each sizable cake dressed while you wait for a mere $3 with discounts for orders of a half-dozen or more.  Opting to stick with "Mad About Favorite Flavors" rather than getting too creative it was to a quartet of cakes that my order led and beginning with the most simple of options I was immediately impressed as natural aromatics flooded the palate first from smooth vanilla and then with poignant cinnamon, both beneath soft buttercream and a decorative cookie.  Moving next to a duo of favorites it was unfortunately in the carrot cake that the bakers would stumble as a citrus center did nothing for the underspiced cake but with thick cream cheese frosting applied liberally as a saving grace the tasting quickly recovered with rich red velvet, the ample cocoa notes finding a suitable foil in vanilla top notes and a tangy finish all the better alongside a cup of good coffee.

VA mile and a half walk from work, easily doable in less than 20 minutes, and yet I guess I cannot really justify a reason to return save for the art...which I could just as easily see on a Saturday or Sunday without the hassle.  The local crafters are friendly and the crowd is an eclectic one, but generally eschewing street food and food trucks I cannot say much about the food or the general quality of the art did much for me.  Decent in that it is free, but largely just makes me want to visit the Arts District during daylight hours to avoid the 'see and be seen' scene to focus on the galleries and themes.

VPretty generic compared to the Forum Shoppes and Fashion show and certainly more pricey than the outlets......we have malls better than this in my home town of Toledo.  \u000a\u000aWhile I dig the pseudo-sky that used to be Aladdin's, I'm not quite sure why this place LACKS a planet hollyywood, yet there is  planet hollywood in some of the other malls.  Its going to take some work for this place to reach the level of any of the myriad Vegas shopping options....but I likely won't be back.

VItems selected:\u000a\u000aCoffee\u000aPeach Coffee Cake\u000aMonte Cristo - Turkey, Ham, Swiss\u000aPeanut Butter Stuffed French Toast - Peanut Butter Cream Cheese Filling, Honey, Bananas\u000aCroissant French Toast - Seasonal Berries, Banana, Powdered Sugar\u000a\u000aWith my mother in town for two more days another weekend of eating and unpacking began at local favorite "The Cracked Egg" and although I have to say the kitsch décor and happy holiday tunes contrasted severely with weary and disinterested service the food itself was quite good.  Clearly known for their daily interpretations of classical coffee cake I will admit that I was a tad put off by both the microwaving and obvious use of canned peaches (as well as artificial syrup sitting on the counter) but speaking only to flavor the cake truly is as good as the rumors; light as angel food but topped with sugary streusel and rife with fruit.  Moving next to three plates divided and shared the kitchen again proved more than competent with diner classics and although ingredient quality could certainly be better the fried Monte Cristo was a truly faithful rendition of the classic yet not overly greasy while the French toasts were each rich and flavorful, the croissant version compromised by mushy blueberries but loaded with butter while peanut butter was a skilled kissed version of a childhood favorite, the sort of memories immune to ingredient quality or surly service and just plain delicious.

VFull review blogged:\u000a\u000aCrostini di Fegatini alla Fiorentina:  $5. Nothing complicated here, just rough ground chicken liver pate over homemade toasted bread with a bit of parsley.  Served chilled and ample in portion, no complaints.\u000a\u000aMaialino:  $18.  The most limited item on the menu this spit-roast baby piglet was gone by the time we left and although the skin could have been crispier the flavors were spot on - the pork supple and rife with notes of garlic, rosemary, coriander, and pepper while the skin was slightly sweet and plenty smoky.\u000a\u000aPanino con Porchetta: $8.95. Much like the Maialino this could have used a bit more crackle on the surface but all things being equal it would be pretty hard to complain about crusty Italian bread wrapped around warm pork roast with plenty of black pepper, fennel and light citrus notes.\u000a\u000aBaccala` in Umido con Polenta: $18. One of my primary reasons for wanting to visit Andreoli in the first place was this dish and thankfully it did not disappoint one bit.  Big in portion, huge in flavor, and in my opinion the most well executed dish of the afternoon I figured going into it that the cod would be excellent and as good as it was, the biggest shocker of the dish was perfect execution of the polenta - toothsome, dense, and a veritable sponge for both the tomatoes and the briny fish.\u000a\u000aCaponata Sicula: $5. Simple, savory, and perhaps the deal of the day this plate of tender eggplant, briny capers, pine nuts, tomatoes, balsamic, and olive oil with hints of basil and onion was plenty to share and would have only been better with some warm bread for dipping.\u000a\u000aTrippa alla Toscanaccia: $14. With almost half of our table having never eaten tripe and another not really a fan of the dish I figured I'd be doing most of the legwork on this dish and although everyone took a taste my suspicions fortuitously proved correct - an acquired taste for sure, this was really good.  Thin like soup and plenty fatty despite being loaded with meat with notes of onion, tomato, and vinegar at the fore while mint and garlic came through on the palate this was another place that some extra bread would have been welcomed as far too much broth remained at the end.\u000a\u000aMille Feuille: $7. While I contest this should have been referred to as a Napoleon I guess it really doesn't matter because regardless of nationality what we received was flaky pastry wrapped around lightly sweetened pastry cream.  Clearly not as transcendent as some of the a la minute options being turned out elsewhere as this one had been stored in the chiller all day I have to say I was largely impressed by the separation of the layers and lack of sogginess.\u000a\u000aRhum Baba: $2 each.  Also straight from the chilled case these traditional baba were everything one could hope from the classic dish - a buttery ball of pastry drown in rum; a sledgehammer of flavor up front with a buttery sweet finish; at one bite each I'm pretty sure I'd have been tipsy with a half dozen.\u000a\u000aStruffoli: $4.  Another very traditional selection you don't really see all that often at Italian markets or bakeries these marble sized pastry balls were crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and absolutely dredged in honey.  A stark textural juxtaposition to the baba which was soft throughout I personally enjoyed these a lot, though having sat for a while the honey had begun to harden which made them a bit difficult to extract from the small dish.\u000a\u000aCornetti: $2.50.  Golden crisp on the outside, buttery caverns within, and fortunately a brand new batch when I ran back in to make my purchase this warm nutella croissant was the highlight of the sweets for me - a strong contender for best croissant in town that remained fluffy despite the chocolate-hazenut filling while the exterior shattered to the tooth.\u000a\u000aSfogliatelle: $3.  Lightly citrus thanks to the use of candied lemon peel, even crispier than the cornetti on the outside, and a pillow of ricotta smoothness within - if you go to Andreoli and don't order one of these you're missing out...as a matter of fact, I'd go so far as to suggest that this item alone is worth a visit to Andreoli as it was every bit as good as any I've ever tasted on either coast (admittedly having not yet been to Italy.)\u000a \u000aSchiacciata uva: $4.  I'd never tried this prior to Andreoli's and, as a matter of fact, I'd never even seen it.  Quite simply a focaccia base with fresh grapes placed at the center prior to baking thus allowing the juices to infuse the dough as it cooked this was sweet, light, and full of flavor - the sort of dish that would be easy to whip up for a party and equally easy to dress up in any number of variations.\u000a\u000aThe Verdict:  Fresh, rustic, and very authentic this one definitely goes on the 'under the radar' list and while I'm unable to speak to Andreoli's quality during normal business hours I can only say that based on what I experienced at the Christmas festival I'm eager to return.

V...steel bleachers, no handrails, steep steps, and a terrible team almost every year?  I miss The Shoe.  Certainly there are worse places to see a game and I'll give them credit for the helpful crew who drive the elderly and handicapped up and down the hill, but all things being equal this place needs an update sometime sooner rather than later.

VNice.  Slightly limited selection on this particular morning but picked up some great looking (and tasting) red and green peppers, a few squash blossoms, Brussles Sprouts, and Mushrooms for a great price.  Considered buying some edible cacti (can't find that in Ohio) but need to learn more about how to cook them before making the investment.

VDishes sampled include:\u000a\u000aStrawberry Aguas frescas naturals\u000a\u000aArnold Palmer\u000a\u000aDel Rey - Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, sausage, chorizo, eggs, tomato, onions, jalapeño and avocado\u000a\u000aCubana - Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, tomato, onions, and avocado\u000a\u000aPierna - Pork sirloin with melted cheese, tomato, onions, and avocado\u000a\u000aChocoflan\u000a\u000aTrying to get my family to visit divey ethic restaurants with me is generally difficult and yet when I suggested Los Reyes De La Torta they seemed agreeable; perhaps an effect of learning to trust me, perhaps due to the online menu, or perhaps seeing a resemblance to Cemitas Puebla in Chicago and arriving at the restaurant early in the lunch hour to find the place more than half full it would not be long before we were seated...in the small side room near the bar...with the only other Gringos in the restaurant...clearly segregated from the Spanish speaking clientele populating the larger front dining area.  At first a bit put off by this obvious isolation but quickly greeted by a pleasant young woman who proved both friendly and efficient we decided to stay, outcast or not, and what followed was actually a very impressive lunch at a bargain basement price.\u000a\u000aOnce (unbeknownst to us) featured on "Man vs. Food" it became obvious soon on opening the menu which items were considered signatures and with myself opting for the Del Rey while my mother and aunt went with similar, less gaudy options, plus a pair of icy mixed drinks similar in texture to the Slush-Puppies of my youth but far more delicious; the Arnold Palmer especially excellent with light bitter and a lot of sour without being overly sweet. \u000a\u000aMoving on to the food, with each sandwich served on a fluffy and yeasty bolillo roll stuffed with flavorful meat and top quality produce, I can honestly say that every single bite of the Del Ray exceeded my expectations while both my mother and aunt seemed happy with their selections, as well.  Generally not one to order a sandwich as I find them monotonous after a couple of bites the Del Ray succeeded where so many others failed because each bite was slightly different from the last, some smoky, some spicy, some saline, and others creamy and rife with fresh avocado.  Large, easily enough to share, and certainly not for the faint of heart this is definitely the sort of dish that could have flopped and become nothing but a gluttonous mess but in reality, despite all the ingredients, never once did something seem unnecessary or overwhelming to the other ingredients...and as much as restraint probably would have been wise I enjoyed every last bite, a fact that *almost* made me glad they were sold out of their signature King Cake; though the dense "Chocoflan" of moist chocolate pudding cake meets smooth, creamy flan was quite rich itself. \u000a\u000aWith the Del Rey ringing in at a mere $9.50 I find it hard to believe that there is any place in the city offering more interesting Mexican food at a better value, though if there is I need to seek it out...right after I find some dining pals to head back to Los Reyes for Pambasos and Huaraches and some King Cake.

V...it isn't Used Kids or Vintage Vinyl, but considering the size of the space they sure do cram a lot of quality into this place.  Good prices and (relatively) friendly employees - not a 'destination' record store, but worth stopping by if you're in the area.

VTucked away in the corner of Caesars Palace it is no wonder that many people do not even realize Payard exists, let alone the fact that it serves up some of the most delectable breakfast items in Vegas.  Known for his New York Outpost, Payard himself is rarely found at this location (unlike Jean-Philippe over at the Bellagio) but the shop, scene, and food are no less impressive.\u000a\u000aArriving in Vegas around 8am local time after a non-stop flight, I got checked in and made my way to Payard by 10:05 for breakfast.  Though the all-you-can-eat continental buffet was still ongoing, I first stopped in the Patisserie to browse chocolate and dessert selections, and to pick up some candies for my mother and aunt.  While everything was beautiful and the crepes appeared wonderful, the prices were decidedly even worse than Jean Phillipe and the selection less impressive.  After making my purchase I made my way next door for breakfast.\u000a\u000aSeating was readily available and the friendly attendant/waitress seated me near a window next to two rather crude foreign businessmen who preceded to discuss their sex lives quite loudly in public.  Though the waitress once asked them to keep it down, it did not really help.  So much for class.....thankfully they were easy to ignore as I watched the chef perform his craft at the wide open kitchen station in the middle of the restaurant.\u000a\u000aCoffee was pretty standard fare and was served quickly and refilled mostly adequately (I was empty for a good 5 minutes between cups 2 and 3) despite there being multiple servers who appeared to be standing around chatting amongst themselves.  For breakfast I opted for the Almond Croissant and the Payard Chocolate Waffles with Nutella and Caramelized Bananas.\u000a\u000aServed first, the Croissant was heavenly with a buttery crisp crust surrounding a flawlessly fluffy center stuffed (and I mean jam packed) with almond compote.  Sweet yet savory, this was and still is the best Croissant I've ever tasted in terms of texture and second best in terms of taste (sorry, the Almond Chocolate Croissant at Bouchon is a revelation.)\u000a\u000aMy second dish was the Waffles and all I can do is be amazed.  Small yet incredibly decadent, the portion was just right.....any more and I'd have been overly full.  The waffles were soft and fluffy (unlike the super-crisp chocolate waffles at Norma's NYC) while the Bananas were perfectly sweet and succulent.  The Nutella was more than ample, as well.  All said, a beautiful and tasty dish that I'd certainly recommend.\u000a\u000aMy only complaint aside from my co-diners and the coffee would be the fact that everything felt quite rushed....my whole meal lasting a mere 40 minutes and check delivered without asking if there was anything else I wanted.  My server only visited the table when delivering an item or to collect the bill and the to-go coffee I was promised was never delivered.  All told, fantastic food in a so-so environment with so-so service.  High prices, but absolutely worth it, and a breakfast that would be "best of" in many other cities.\u000a\u000aSee profile site for full review with formatted pics.

VFortuitously as I was making my way toward to the entrance to meet my friend I happened past Payard and decided to stop in just to browse.  Speaking with the friendly young lady behind the counter I was informed that since they were getting close to the end of the day anything left in the case was buy one get one.  "Bogo on amazing french pastries?" I thought - I'd be a fool to pass that up.  Selecting two they were packed into a pretty plastic container and I went to meet my friend.  Offering my pal his selection he told me he had just finished dinner with his wife and was stuffed - but he did try a bite of each.\u000a\u000aStarting first with the Tiramisu - not French, but a must almost anywhere I see it - the dish was served fancifully in a plexi-glass square.  Layers of vanilla mascarpone, rum soaked lady fingers, cream, and dusted with cocoa and a bit of chocolate drizzle the dish actually hid a surprise - a core of Raspberry.  While my sister would have been greatly upset by this unannounced guest I have to admit I liked the manner in which the fruity sweetness balanced the dark cocoa tones and heavy rum.\u000a\u000aThe second dish, one of Payard's signatures, was vastly more impressive than the tiramisu - it was called Louvre.  Featuring "Chocolate mousse and hazelnut mousse with a hazelnut dacquoise" and topped with a thick 72% dark chocolate shell I can only compare this dish to one thing (something that doesn't do it a bit of justice,) a nutella version of a peanut butter cup.  With the gelatinous shell giving way to a milk chocolate mousse, then hazelnut mousse, then a hazelnut cookie...a beautiful blending of textures, tastes, and not heavy at all.\u000a\u000aAll said, Raku with tax and tip, a cab ride, coffee, and two pastries from Payard cost me less than Colors of Caviar would cost a la carte at Guy Savoy - sure "Colors" has vastly more ingredient cost, but that just goes to show that for the discerning foodie you can indeed do some fine dining in Vegas without totally breaking the bank.  While I'm certainly not going to say that a split meal at Raku and Payard is in any way comparable to dinner at Savoy or Robuchon, I do believe that during future culinary trips outside of Ohio I'm going to make sure at least one place is "off the beaten path"

VTI's brekfast entailed eggs, chicken sausage, and dessert after dessert after dessert.  It was great, albeit the worst of our 3 breakfasts by far (Paris and Bellagio otherwise).....the fruit sushi and donut machine were definitely unique, though

VChanging with the seasons and always nothing less than stunning, there is probably no better space for pictures on the strip.  Currently featuring one of the most impressive butterfly houses I've seen as well as "living paintings" replanted each day this is truly a must see space for tourists and locals alike.

VSuffice it to say that I wish Springs Preserve was as good as the concept, but in reality this is essentially just a paid-admission public park.  $9.95 for NV residents and their families with great discounts on memberships I'm happy to support the vision of the team behind the preserve and I even enjoyed the Davinci exhibit for a little while, but when it comes right down to it there is not much to bring you back here after a single visit save for the occasional concert in the park.

VArriving at eight on the dot we actually presented to closed doors - no worries though, they'd open only minutes later.  Making our way into the vast confines of the restaurant we stated our names, though reservations clearly were not necessary.  Led to a comfortable 4-top near the large glass windows we marveled at the black and white tiled floor, raw bar, cheese bar, cork wreath, chandeliers, and generally lovely layout of the space.  Greeted quickly by our server, Gina G, we were provided with menus and water was filled for us all while the others opted for Orange Juice, Hot Tea, and a specialty French Press of Rwandan Komera coffee - a bold citrus blend with plenty of body that didn't really appeal to me, but my mother enjoyed a lot.\u000a\u000aBrowsing the menu of both traditional and non-traditional bistro fare we settled on a pair of sweets and a pair of savories to be shared around.  With service good throughout the meal there were two small issues considering only one other table was seated during the entirety of our brunch - the first being the fact that my water actually reached empty twice and the second when one of the ancillary staff nearly filled my sister's tea with coffee.  With light classical playing overhead it would be approximately 15 minutes before our plates would arrive.\u000a\u000aFor myself, the standard in such circumstances; a Croque Madame with Country Ham, Gruyère Cheese, Sauce Mornay,Crispy Sourdough, Fried Egg and a side of Pommes Frites with organic Heinz ketchup.  While the frites were largely a miss - hot but somewhat anemic and flavorless, the sandwich was actually quite good, albeit lightly topped.  With two thin slices of rich ham and an equal portion of Gruyere sandwiched between the crispy bread, the highlight of the dish was unquestionably the lovely Mornay and creamy egg yolk.  \u000a\u000aThe second option, my mothers, was the crispy Belgium Waffle with fresh Berries and Housemade Vanilla Syrup.  Simple in concept the execution of this dish was quite poor in my opinion - the waffle doughy and the vanilla syrup tasting identical to the pure maple syrup (not a bad thing, but false advertising) until blended with the dollop of vanilla cream atop the waffles.  Admittedly the fruits were very fresh and tasty, however.\u000a\u000aOpting for more unique dishes proved advantageous to my sister and aunt, the sooner ordering the Crab Oscar Benedict with Asparagus, Dungeness crab, Poached Eggs, and Citrus Hollandaise atop a round popover.  Already hefty and artery clogging with the crab clearly cooked in butter and the lovely hollandaise with just a tinge of lemon, piercing the two creamy eggs with a fork added a whole new level to the dish.  With white asparagus adding necessary fiber and texture the entirety of this dish was decadence well worth the calories.\u000a\u000aThe final choice, my aunts, was another winner - Banana and Mascarpone stuffed French Toast with Saigon cinnamon and pure maple syrup.  With bread similarly shaped to that from the popover I gather the toast itself was actually a bread pudding style custard.  With a thick layer of banana accented sweet cheese inside and fresh bananas atop the toast was first pan seared and then torch bruleed forming a crisp top that crackled on cutting.  With plentiful notes of cinnamon and the maple syrup on the plate instead of being poured over top I really liked the flavor profile and presentation of the dish, as did my aunt who is not keen on maple as she finds it overwhelming.\u000a\u000aWith tax and tip the total for brunch would run approximately $25 a person - not a bargain compared to the $5 grand slam at Denny's that we passed to get there, but on par with the prices at Mon Ami Gabi and slightly less pricey than MoZen, Tableau, or Bouchon.  With that said, while there was nothing wrong with Morels, it also didn't move me or wow me and at such a price I'd much sooner take the elevator up to Bouchon at the Venetian than the escalator down to Morels at the Palazzo.  The Croque, Frites, French Toast, and Waffles at Bouchon are simply better....and the eggs and crab dish I'd have there on Christmas day left that Benedict a distant memory, regardless of how good it was.

VItems Selected:\u000aSouthern Belle - Red Velvet with Cream Cheese Frosting\u000aBugsy - Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting\u000aKir Royale - Raspberry Cake with Champagne Frosting\u000aEl Rolo - Rich Chocolate Cake piped with Dulce de Leche with Chocolate Ganache\u000aZoolander - Zucchini Cake with pecans, chocolate chips, pineapple and Cream Cheese Frosting\u000aSweet & Salty - Caramel Cake with Swirled Cream Cheese Frosting, Caramel, Himalayan Pink Salt\u000a\u000aFormerly with several locations spread across the valley but recently supplanted on the Strip by Corner Cakes it was a brief meeting that brought me to Lake Meade Boulevard's "The Cupcakery" and with smiling staff serving up several novel interpretations of their eponymous treat it seems unthinkable to me that anyone would eschew such a place in favor of its abhorrent substitute.  Featuring no less than eighteen varieties on my Saturday visit with all selections made in-house of largely organic ingredients, pure butter, and no preservatives each $3.25 creation of owner Pamela Jenkins begins with an impressively moist base featuring light sweetness and a supple crumb before building upward to a variety of frostings, the majority cream cheese, ready to serve the sweet tooth but never to overwhelm - the result a series of balanced bites with subtlety and nuance at the fore,  In many ways overwhelming in options given cakes both traditional and trendy it was with the dainty Kir Royale that my tasting began and progressing light to heavy it was next the appropriately titled "Sweet & Salty" that wowed, the pink crystals a textural masterstroke and veritable palate cleanser to slightly under-spiced carrot cake and the inspired chocolate freckled Zoolander instantly rousing memories of Autumn in Ohio.  Tasting bites throughout the afternoon interspersed with sips of La Colombe's Corsica it was perhaps an effect of my coffee predilections that my final two tastes of The Cupcakery would prove most memorable and as good as the prototypical Red Velvet was in delivering light cocoa beneath aggressive tang it was the seasonal "El Rolo" that stole the spotlight, an Amedei-like smokiness to the dark chocolate proving an ample foil to intensely sweet liquid caramel.

VBigger than the one in Scottsdale but with a far less excellent soundtrack and far more hipsters, teens, and college kids trying far too hard to be far too sophisticated I still have to say Cartel's coffee still continues to impress; this time a bold and smooth chocolate toned cup of Guatemalan Finca El Limonar followed by an iced Toddy made with a 50/50 blend of Black Market and Viota.  A local gem to be sure.

VFull review in the Blog - only reason for a star off is the paucity of dessert choices at lunch.  At dinner I imagine this place is a solid 5.\u000a\u000aArriving toward the end of the lunch hour we entered Carnevino dressed casually - a tad out of place compared to the all black and white clad service staff.  Seated promptly and greeted by Josh nearly the moment we were seated the service never faltered throughout our stay - water was refilled rapidly, dishes served impeccably, and bread service...we'll get to that later.  Browsing around the large room and high ceilings, dark woods, and white tablecloths covering widely spaced tables the restaurant definitely felt very Batali - and the soundtrack of Beatles, Eagles, The Who, and Stones coming from the front of the house left no doubt.\u000a\u000aMy buddies having already begun their daily drinking at the tables and myself a non drinker we all opted for water - water with ice and multiple refills.  After taking orders and heading to the kitchen we were brought the first of a couple rounds of dinner rolls.  Tasting the incredibly complex sweet yet salty and crisp exterior which yielded a pillow-soft interior not unlike a croissant I inquired of our server what exactly constituted these delicious pieces of carbohydrate - lardo, butter, flour, yeast, and "a bit of parmesan" I was informed.\u000a\u000aAllowed to sit and chat for a while before our mains arrived I joked with my buddies about the fact that we had gone to, arguably, the best steak restaurant in Vegas and neither had ordered a steak - one opting for the Tuna caponata, cocoa agro dolce and the other choosing The Burger with pancetta and onion cheddar and arugula salad.  Stating that steak was a "dinner food' I clearly realized that I needed more epicurean friends.  All joking aside, both of them loved their meal and their dishes looked and smelled excellent  - while my one friend didn't prefer the cocoa accents to his tuna he loved the fish and my other friend stated the burger was the best he'd ever tasted.\u000aFor myself, the decisions for this meal were based on previous Batali experience and both dishes wowed - as expected.  Served together since neither of my friends opted for an appetizer the first dish was from the dinner anti-pasti menu and was entitled "House-Cured Pastrami" with local duck egg and emerald butter lettuce.  While I generally don't prefer beef textures, particularly "lunch meats" such as pastrami I was told by Mr. Feit that this dish was more like beef bacon and was made from the dry-aged stock of BBL beef.  Trusting his judgement I have to admit this dish was very impressive with the pastrami truly being like a clean and spicy pork bacon in texture - great fattiness and almost melt in the mouth texture despite its somewhat dehydrated nature.  Accompanying the pastrami - a single duck egg sunny side up alongside a delicate and dare-I-say "buttery" lettuce.  Atop the dish was a combination of aged balsamic, olive oil, cracked pepper, and pan juices from the slight pan-kissing of the pastrami.  Breaking the yolk of the egg the dish was given a creamy contrast to the other sharp, spicy, and acidic flavors and truly impressed.\u000a\u000aThe second dish, also requested from the dinner menu, was entitled Sweetbreads "al boscaiolo" which according to my server meant "lumberjack style."  Served with pan seared mixed/chopped mushrooms, fresh peas, spinach, and a reduction of honey, rosemary, and perhaps sage the sweetbreads were perfectly flash fried to retain their creamy texture and without a bit of brine.  Clearly using a bit of salt, pepper, and perhaps cheese in the crispy coating the sweetbreads on their own would have been superb - but pairing their creamy and spicy preparation with the crisp yet mildly sweet greens, woody and smooth mushrooms, and heavily accented honey made the dish a truly one of a kind experience - while not as "refined" as Guy Savoy's preparation the night prior these may have actually been my favorite sweetbread preparation all time - or at least on par with the versions at Alex, Savoy, and (as much as I dislike admitting it) Michael Symon's Lola.\u000a\u000aFinishing up our meals we were told that the dessert menu at lunch was limited to cheeses and ice creams and as such we deferred - too bad since the peach fritters and roasted spiced dates sounded excellent.  Settling the tab the meal was actually my cheapest lunch or dinner in Vegas yet extremely rewarding.  While I could've certainly done without the Eagles (I hate the f&%ckin' Eagles Man! - Lebowski) the service was excellent and accommodating from e-mail all the way to leaving the restaurant and the food was superb.

A large space with soaring ceilings, heavy woods, and smooth marble befitting both a Vegas Steakhouse and the Italian Chef/Restaurateur backing the venture it was at the bar that our evening began while a large table was cleared in the larger back room and with excellent cocktails and a superlative wine list it would not be long before we were seated, drinks in hand - the subsequent two and a half hours awash in food, cocktails, wine, stories, and laughs with servers who kept pace amicably.  Beginning with appetizers and progressing through perfectly pastas, lightly prepared proteins, interesting sides, and thankfully dainty desserts with a main course of nearly 8lbs of aged super-prime beef from Adam Lang plus supple duck and a hefty piece of foie gras poached in Barolo it would be difficult to imagine any "steakhouse" putting on a better performance than what we experienced that evening and although such a meal invariably comes with a substantial tab, particularly on the Vegas Strip, this was a night of excess worthy of the expense and without a doubt a night to remember.

VFull review blogged:\u000a\u000aTrio of Duck Fat Fries including Smoked Paprika-BBQ Sauce, Pepper Dusted-Rosted Garlic Aioli, and Fine Herbs-Onion Ketchup:  Known in the past for his 'trios,' at his San Francisco Flagship the meal at The Princess started the same as that at MGM Detroit with a trio of perfect French fries each dusted with a signature spice blend and matched to a complimentary condiment.  Crunchy on the exterior and just a bit toothsome within I'm still not exactly sure that I'm 'sold' on the way so many chef's flaunt the use of duck fat for fries but all things being equal these were really good, particularly the fine herbs interpretation.\u000a\u000aFoie Gras Duo with Roasted Bing Cherries and Almond Streusel:  While I generally eschew the restaurant week menu it was the non-RW appetizer that would prove to be the biggest failure of the meal and, perhaps, the biggest food failure I've had since moving to the valley - simply stated, this was a piece of foie that should have never made it to the kitchen let alone to the table.  Undersized, overcooked, poorly cleaned, and still somehow lukewarm on arrival there was really nothing to like about the seared portion of liver aside from the cherries - and least of all the veins and sinew zigzagging the palate.  Moving on to the second half of the duo a creamy terrine beneath cherry gel was presented and paired with buttery brioche it was nearly good enough to save the plate - but not quite, particularly as Christina's response to our complaint was simply taking the dish off of our bill rather than suggesting the chef take a second try with a better piece of foie gras and more attention to detail.\u000a\u000aCaramelized Black Mission Figs- Spicy Sopressata, Preserved Lemon Ricotta:  Rather horrified by the liver I was heartened by the first choice from the restaurant week menu; a sort of composed cheese plate featuring the intense fructose of fresh figs matched up against the bite of sopressata and lightly fragranced ricotta.  Like most Bay Area chefs I'd suggest that if a Mina restaurant is offering up a fig dish you'd be wise to order it.\u000a\u000aCrispy Sonoma Duck Breast- Cipollini & Brussel Sprout Hash, Huckleberry Compote:  One of three RW main courses and for my dollar the most obvious choice by a landslide the kitchen was gracious enough to serve us each a separate portion of the Sonoma margret and while I cannot say it soared to the same levels as Chef DeRuvo's version at Davanti Enoteca a few weeks prior this was another excellent preparation of my favorite protein with the aged fowl's slight must perfectly tempered by the pungent hash and sweet berry reduction.  Easily cut with the edge of a fork despite being served with one of the restaurant's signature steak knives and as tender as you could hope I'm still having trouble getting over the fact that I now live in a city where good duck exists at not just one but multiple restaurants.\u000a\u000aWhole Fried Chicken for Two with Truffled Mac & Cheese:  Yes it is $58 for chicken, but compared to the $200 Bresse at Savoy or the $78 version at The Nomad I guess you could call this brined, battered, and duck fat fried version a bargain if it was nearly as good as the others...and thankfully it was.  Featuring a plump hen with breading so dainty that it approximated the thickness of skin the bird was carved tableside and laid on a bed of truffled macaroni and cheese plus baby carrots before being topped with crispy onion rings and with each of the accoutrements quite delicious none were as good as the chicken itself - dense, moist, full of flavor, and complimented by rather than being overwhelmed by the seasoned breading.\u000a\u000aBourbon Bar- Dark Chocolate, Peanut Butter, Pretzel:  Seeing as how my writing is impossibly behind at this point suffice it to say I'd already experienced this dish at Baltimore's Wit & Wisdom and I was glad to revisit it as the alternate RW dessert.  Described loosely as the chef's interpretation of a candy bar this dessert beings with a core of sweetened peanut butter mousse and dresses it with dense 70% dark chocolate ganache before bespeckling it with crumbled nougat, peanuts, and finally chocolate covered pretzels.\u000a\u000aCarrot Cake with Cream Cheese Icing, Crème Fraiche Sorbet:  With Mr. Mathias stopping by to check in a conversation about Mina et al's approach to pastry ensued and after mentioning my fondness for his unique interpretations of American comfort foods we found ourselves gifted this one last plate.  Beginning at its base with airy spice cake flecked with carrots and studded with currants atop a smear of whipped cream cheese this dessert, much like the panna cotta, was taken to a whole different level through the addition of two frozen quenelles, one tangy crème fraiche and the other strikingly vegetal carrots.  Bite for bite the most delicious and complicated of the evening's three desserts this was just another exam  how Chef Mina understands the powerful effect of American comfort food.

VSee profile site for full review with formatted pics.\u000a\u000aHaving gone to Delmonico just one day prior and leaving less than impressed with the overall experience, yet thoroughly pleased by the food I decided to hold off on more Emeril (or rather more bread pudding) until next trip and instead reacquaint myself with Mr. Batali at Enoteca San Marco.  Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately?) my friend who arrived early on Thursday morning doesn't fancy Italian and Vegas' dearth of quality lunch options led us to Table 10 at the Palazzo.  I've said it before and I'll say it again, regardless of others' opinions on Emeril his cooking is top notch, and his bread puddings and shrimp have never failed to be excellent. \u000a \u000aArriving at Table 10, one immediately notices the staunch contrast to Delmonico's white/wood/elegant setting with the fancy wrought iron gates out front and multiple colored tables, televisions, and wide open kitchen.  Elegant yet trendy in a similar fashion to the New Orleans Fish House, yet more unique and upscale in appearance, decor, and service.....sort of bridging the gap between the casual Fish House and upscale Delmonico.\u000a \u000aSeating was prompt and menus and water were delivered quickly.  While the lunch menu was slightly more limited than dinner, the options were still substantial.  I was slightly annoyed by our waiter who seemed somewhat bored and aloof as he mentioned their "famous signature dish" was the Maine lobster pot pie (the most expensive item on the menu.)  First of all, a dish cannot be "famous" when you've only been open for a couple of months.  Secondly, as a creole cook, Maine lobster is NOT signature....shrimp, crawfish, and jumbalaya, and bread pudding are.  Third, this is Michael Mina's signature, not yours, so don't lie.  \u000a \u000aAs I'd had breakfast at Bouchon followed by a stop at Bouchon bakery I must admit I wasn't entirely hungry, but my buddy had not eaten since flying in from Michigan.  For my meal I selected two appetizers; the Jambalaya with andouille sausage, clams, and shrimp plus the rotisserie chicken pizza w/ mushrooms, garlic, and buffala mozzarella while my friend opted for the enormous plate of Jambalaya pasta.  After orders were taken we sat and chatted and were delivered some of the most delicious sweet butter rolls I've ever experienced.  All told I think I consumed 3 rolls but it very well could have been 5, they were that good.\u000a\u000aMains were served after approximately 20 minutes and everything looked and tasted great.  The jambalaya was spicy without being overpowering and the roux was thick and hearty.  Ample pork sausage, shrimp, crawfish, and clams were all present along with a well cooked rice that provided good texture and contrast.  Not the very best jambalaya ever, but certainly an excellent representation.  Similar to my dish, my friend's jambalaya pasta contained wonderfully cooked egg noodles and a substantial number of jumbo shrimp plus shredded crawfish in a spicy broth.\u000a\u000aWhile the jambalaya's were excellent, the pizza was even better with a truly "cracker-thin" crust perfectly basted with olive oil and covered with fresh veggies, tender marinated chicken, and fresh/smooth mozzarella.  While not substantial in portion, the price was right at $10 and I'd definitely put this on the list of best chicken pizzas I've tasted.  Not quite as good as Batali's pizza at Otto, but darn good.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, Bread pudding - a no brainer when dining with Emeril....though I must admit there wasn't a single bad sounding option on the dessert menu.  The bread pudding at Table 10 was exemplary consisting of a wonderfully tender Strawberry Brioche Bread Pudding, firm in texture and served hot with Toasted Almond Ice Cream on top.  From the crunchy almonds to the tart berries to the smooth icecream this dish was fantastic and the second best of the 5 Emeril options I've experienced.  Small in portion, yet just right for lunch, I would put it in my top 6 all time behind Gramercy Tavern, the two Bouchon Options, Dessert Truck, and Emeril's in Orlando.  My buddy, a fiend for all things chocolate opted for the Almost Flourless Bourbon Chocolate Cake with Tart Cherry Compote and Brown Sugar Crème Fraiche which he noted was very good, though not as good as the chocolate cake at Emeril's New Orleans Fish House.\u000a\u000aAll told, I'd rank Table 10 as my favorite lunch in Vegas (compared to Delmonico, Mesa Grill, Burger Bar, Sensi, and numerous buffets.)  Great quality, decent service, and a decent setting.  Looking at the menu I'd probably not return for dinner since the best items are also available at lunch, but if I lived close to Vegas I'd certainly not turn down an invite for lunch or dinner.  Best Emeril's in Vegas and second best Emeril's overall.

VAnother day and another bakery; a second stop on my tour of the Valley of the Sun would take me to Scratch Pastries & Bistro, a relative newcomer (2008) to the scene featuring both baked goods and a bistro menu focusing not only on French inspired creations but also frequently utilizing French imported items in their creation.  The brainchild of Duc Liao and his wife Noelle based on their time in Paris as a photographer and model, respectively, the space had originally appeared on my radar based on the recommendation of a friend and had only increased its status in my mind by advertising one of my favorite desserts - the Paris Brest - on their website.\u000a\u000aLocated in a rather unattractive strip-mall beside a Subway my arrival to Scratch would be just past noon and with the thermostat topping the century mark I made my way quickly from the car to the cute French-Chic interior and greeted by two young ladies behind the counter I was asked if I planned to dine in or take some items to go, a decision I debated for a few seconds before I was handed a menu and left to decide.  Already with lunch plans I knew the bistro menu was not the choice (though admittedly the duck and foie gras had my attention) and as such I turned my attention to the pastry case only to be told that no Paris Brest was available - a disappointment to be sure, but at the same time given the variety of options (including a number of my other favorites) not totally disheartening and after a few moments of indecision I opted for three selections, paid the modest tab, and made my way outside to enjoy.\u000a\u000aBeginning first with the only warm item of the group, an almond croissant fresh from the oven, my first bite from Scratch would show that the Liao's time in Paris had been well spent as the golden shell shattered on my bite giving way to an airy layered interior with a smear of sweet frangipane that not only added flavor and nuance to the already sweet pastry but also did not weigh down the wispy pastry inside; a fine balance not often seen in American Almond Croissants.\u000a\u000aMoving next to another French specialty, a small Salted Caramel Macaron stored refrigerated in a plastic sheath, this two bite $3 cookie would prove rather average largely due to the temperature and a degree of dampness marring its characteristic crackling shell.  With the filling ample in flavor I do wonder if perhaps the dry Arizona air has something to do with the decision to store these cookies chilled, but overall it is not a decision I fancied when it came down to texture.\u000a\u000aFor my final taste of Scratch I opted for an American classic, my typical Red Velvet cupcake, and where the macaron disappointed the cupcake achieved at the highest level; a textural masterpiece ranking in my top 3 red velvet cupcakes of all time.  Beginning first with the frosting, seemingly a small puff of sour cream cheese actually tunneling down into the body of the cake, it was quite good but where this cake truly stood out was its density - the sort of moist sponginess that made the cake seem almost undercooked as a bit of red dripped onto my hand, but in reality a veritable cloud of loaded with chocolate and vanilla tones that permeated the palate in perfect balance with the frosting.  \u000a\u000aOverall Scratch was a good visit and I feel like I (pun intended) merely scratched the surface of what they have to offer - if and when I return I'm calling ahead to make sure they have the Brest and while I'm there I'll check out that bistro menu because, really, where else can you get duck and foie gras for lunch in town and chase it with a top notch French Pastry or cupcake?

VItems Selected:\u000a\u000aHop Scotch - Vanilla cake topped with vanilla buttercream dipped in butterscotch ganache\u000aRed Carpet - Red cake topped with almond buttercream and red glitter sugar\u000aApple Cider - Cinnamon swirl cake topped with apple cider buttercream dusted with cinnamon and sugar\u000aGlazed Donut - Vanilla cake drenched in donut glaze\u000aCoffee and Donuts - Vanilla cake covered in donut glaze and topped with a dollop of coffee buttercream\u000aBrownie Sundae - Chocolate chip brownie topped with vanilla buttercream and chocolate fudge\u000a\u000aWhen a co-worker suggested she was looking for 'fancy' cupcakes for her daughter's birthday that evening and a large gap opened in my midday schedule a plan was hatched to finally visit Centennial staple "Retro Bakery" - a dozen cupcakes for the party that evening and six to be saved for my Saturday dining, each of the $2.65 selections proving unique and impressive...and all at a price nearly half that of other local and national cupcakeries.  Locally owned & operated by Kari and Brian Haskell for the past six years and turning out no less than a dozen varieties of cupcakes daily with fresh-bakes ongoing as dictated by need it was to smiling service and a mostly full selection that we arrived and choosing a wide variety each frosted gem was carefully packed into individually slotted boxes; the total tab under $50 even after putting a few bucks in the tip jar.  Having heard that the birthday cakes were a resounding success and ensuring freshness by securing my picks airtight in the refrigerator overnight it was with half-cakes after a long morning run that my Saturday began and working from lightest to most dense each option shined, both donut varieties harkening the flavor of a good cake-style ring with light glaze while the signature Hop Scotch presented the same supple vanilla base beneath rich butterscotch brimming with caramelized notes of brown sugar.  Moving next to bases with more heft, the Apple Cider was selected largely because the young lady at the counter described it as a "sort of coffee cake" and true to form, the dense crumb was rich with apples and cinnamon akin to the flavor of an apple fritter and duly appointed with sharply spiced butter cream, a truly unique option that would have been my favorite of the six had the last two not been equally excellent - a rich take on the red velvet replacing traditional cream cheese frosting with rich frangipane tinged buttercream and the "Friday Only" Brownie Sundae, more cupcake than brownie and rousing fond memories of my childhood when a warm pan of brownies frequently served as a indispensable wintertime dessert.  Dollar for dollar this could quite possibly be the best cupcake shop I've found to date.

VBeing completely honest, I'm usually not a fan of "special events," guest chefs, or the dumbed-down truncated experience of "Restaurant Week" but at $26 (after a deep discount from the quoted $100) with friends already planning on attending Chef Akira Back's "Chef's Tasting" at Yellowtail I tossed caution to the wind...only to reconfirm all the aforementioned prejudices to a whole new degree, leaving the event after 2 hours hungry, a touch intoxicated, and $26 poorer albeit richer in friendships.\u000a\u000a"Spend the afternoon with us at YellowTail inside the Bellagio Las Vegas overlooking the spectacular fountains. Enjoy extraordinary culinary selections from Chef Akira Back and libations provided by Wirtz Beverage.  Chef Akira Back has chosen to feature the Big Eye Tuna Pizza, Crispy Kalbi roll and his famous Baked Crab Hand Roll among other items.  Gulf Oyster Industry Counsel's amazing Oyster bar. Salty coastal waters produce the world's best oysters for the world's best chefs and restaurants, harvested today as they have been for generations.  Chef's menu will be paired with specialty reserved Sakes, Wines & Spirits provided by Wirtz Beverage and custom cocktails created by the mixologists from Hendrick's Gin and Tito's Vodka" as described on the website, the actual format of the event was a standing circus of confusion where "reserved" tables were fed full trays of food while the rest attempted to hunt down one of four circulating servers that were frequently mobbed and stripped clean at the doors where 'diners' gathered like a group of kids playing World of Warcraft sitting on a spawn spot.\u000a\u000aWith booze of decent quality and the modicum of food equally competent a total of six mouthfuls of food plus three oysters were accrued by myself (one literally FROM a reserved table) during the course of the afternoon, probably justifying the $26 though certainly not $100 or the overall aggravation.  With no Akira in site and 'live music' that fell through for unknown reasons I can only assume that this 'event' was a money-grab intended to draw high rollers to The Bellagio or an attention-seeker for an outdated property hoping to generate new fans; both goals a miserable failure as we walked out in search of sustenance down the strip at Aria.

VI'm so torn on everything that is Nortera, but perhaps no place more than this.  Literally 5 minutes from my house there is a huge convenience factor to be taken into account, yet at the same time the fact that they don't stock Equal, my sweetner of choice, and limit their wi-fi to 30 minute bits during the day while Wildflower offers free wi-fi all day, Equal, and better coffee drives me nuts.  In the end I'll probably split my time between the two - using Paradise for study time and/or writing when wi-fi isn't necessary only.  Nice spot.  Good servers.  It just isn't Wildflower.

VI attended Simon's restaurant when it was at the Hardrock......alas it has moved.  \u000a\u000aBegun by my buddy's $25 shot of Patron Platinum (following a $30 OpusX cigar earlier at Shadowbar) everything at Simon was good but overpriced for the quality.  The one shining aspect of the meal was the AMAZING breadbowl, however, featuring homemade cheeze-its, buttermilk biscuits, handmade pretzels, and zucchini bread.\u000a\u000aFor my meal I had the Cali Pizza (Toro, Crab, Avocado, Daikon, Endive, Soy) and 4-cheese saffron truffle mac n' cheese.  Simon states this is the best Mac n' Cheese in the world but I've had better at Michael Mina's Bourbon Steak, Emeril's Fishhouse, and M at Miranova.\u000a\u000aFor dessert?  The junkfood platter with gourmet versions of a hostess cupcake, snowball, ricecrispy treats, and a chocolate shake.  Cute, but essentially just sugary.\u000a\u000aMy friend loved his steak and chocolate cake.\u000a\u000aThe highlight of the meal, however, was the hostess in the leather apron.....yowzaz.

VFull review w/ Pics in blog.\u000a\u000aBeginning first with some appetizers my first choice was Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe.  Arriving after a short wait and in an ample portion the dish consisted of a cool broth with a warm poached egg paired with a creamy Uni tongue and given a myriad of flavors and textures from a "soup" of snappy mountain yams, earthy hon-shimeji mushrooms, salty salmon roe, and pungent green onions.  Breaking the egg and stirring the broth it thickened quickly giving the whole dish a mellow and creamy texture that paired beautifully with the fresh uni and other ingredients - at $7 this may have been the most affordable uni I'd ever experienced with such great taste and honestly I would go back to Raku just to experience this dish again.\u000a\u000aArriving shortly after my first plate was finished - and with an explanation of all the little jars and bottles in front of me (a matcha sea salt, a house made soy, a japanese pepper + rice vinegar, and a chili infused oil) - Seafood with Bonito Guts Pickled in Salt looked and smelled much better than the name would arouse in one's imagination.  As others have mentioned, I really do not understand how this dish was a mere $6.  A heaping bowl filled with a mix of sashimi yellowfin, jackfish, salmon, mackerel, and sprouts each fish was extremely fresh and the sprouts lent some texture to the fleshy-melt-in-your-mouth fishes.  Topping the dish, according to my young server, was a combination of the house soy and the vinegar.  Adding a bit more soy to the already salty mix made the flavor perfect, in my opinion, though I do believe the dish could have benefited from some daikon or perhaps a crisp starch to add a bit more texture.\u000a\u000aThe next dish - well, let's just say it was so good that I ordered a second portion as my main course.  Entitled simply Steamed Egg Custard with Foie Gras the dish looked simple enough - a miso broth with scallions and a piece of Robata duck floating in the broth.  What laid beneath the broth, however, was the true treasure of the dish - a rich and hearty chawanmushi (egg custard) laden with ample accents of foie gras.  When stirred up with the wooden spoon the foie tones rose amply to the palate with the whole dish tasting like the combination of a sweet egg custard and an unctuous foie gras terrine.  While the grilled duck added a fine degree of texture to the dish, I personally thought the duck was a slight bit gamey - not bad, just not perfect.  \u000a\u000aSeeing this dish also offered in the noodle section as an Udon accompaniment I inquired from my server as to whether I could get that dish as a main course, but instead substitute the robata foie gras for the duck.  Not quite understanding my question my server went and got another server who understood perfectly, asked the chef, and assured me this would be no problem.  Receiving this dish after my robata choices and just before dessert I would strongly suggest anyone who attends Raku try this substitution for two reasons - number one, the manner in which the robata grill's high temperatures crisps the foie gras exterior while leaving the center fatty and smooth is unlike anything I've previously experienced - the charring actually mellows the foie all on its own and the texture is more "firm," not unlike the roasted version I had at Blackbird in Chicago, actually.  Number two - those udon noodles served thin and cold to be dunked into a broth of foie gras, egg custard, and more foie gras...think "chicken soup" in its perfect form.\u000a\u000aBetween my two foie dishes I decided to indulge in a couple of Raku's robata skewers - Chicken Breast with Skin.  Fresh organic chicken wrapped in its own skin and cooked to crispy this dish presented some of the most juicy chicken I've had in some time while the addition of the skin added a crisp "crackle" without any breading - better than the Colonel without all the carbs and oil.  Adding first the soy and then the salt I have to say I was quite impressed by the manner in which the matcha's bitter texture worked with the savorieness of the chicken and salt.\u000a\u000aRobata course two was Kurobuta pork cheek and it, like the chicken, was excellent.  Typically quite fatty the high heat of the grill managed to melt the collagen perfectly while burning off some of the fat and only mildly crisping the skin.  The 'rarest' pork I've had since the chop at Babbo I found this to be my favorite, tastewise, of the robtata items and would compare it favorably to some of the better pork belly dishes I've had in terms of taste, texture, and fat to meat ratio.\u000a\u000aThe third robata course was something I've never eaten - Pigs Ears.  Sure I've had trotters, tail, tete, belly, cheek, and all the standard cuts - but not ear.  As others have stated - wow.  Crispy and salty on the outside, fatty next, and a thin chewy layer of cartilage in the middle - almost a 5-layer sandwich with each layer giving a different taste and texture experience.

VWith pastries and coffee now well covered and plenty interesting enough to put Phoenix on my culinary map the next question was how well they did Ice Cream, and coming from the self-proclaimed Ice Cream Capital of America I figured I might as well just go for the best to compare head-to-head with the Jeni's, Bi-Rite's, and Toscanini's of the world - in this case, Scottsdale's own Sweet Republic.\u000a\u000aRated by Bon Appetite as one of the nation's 10-best and focused on small batch artisan flavors just like the rest of the list Sweet Republic is tucked into a small strip mall off Shea Boulevard and while not simple to find the products are also available by the pint at Whole Foods.  Not wanting a pint but rather to sample I made my way up the stairs to the small store to find it largely empty - a surprise since every parlor in Ohio is lined up out the door when it is 100 degrees out, but perhaps not surprising in Scottsdale where temperatures frequently reach such peaks.  Entering the store I was greeted by the smell of sugar, vanilla, and that all-too-familiar scent of ice cream cones and within moments I was greeted by a young lady ready with sampling spoons.\u000a\u000aNot wanting to be greedy but certainly wanting to sample a couple before buying in my first two tastes of Sweet Republic's Ice Cream would be Tres Leches, a dense and flavorful but largely one-dimensional vanilla and next Desert Honey, a lovely bite not dissimilar to a frozen liquid Bit-o-Honey.  With easily twenty more flavors to taste and my server not seeming to mind my next two bites would prove memorable enough to commit to a double - one scoop of Honey Blue Cheese and the other of Salted Butter Caramel - for $4.25.  Waiting for the scoops as I browsed the shops collection of cookies, candies, and even bacon brittle I thanked my server for her assistance and sitting down to enjoy my choices I was very pleased by one and blown away by the other.\u000a\u000aBeginning first with the Salted Butter Caramel, a flavor I try everywhere, this dense concoction with pockets of liquid gold oozing from the otherwise milky sweet ice cream was exceptional and on par in all ways with that of Jeni's back home - potentially even better though a side-by-side would need to be done to be certain.  Moving next to the Blue Cheese - easily a top 5 ice cream moment of all time with the sharp notes of the cheese aptly countered by the sweetness of the honey and the overall texture somewhere between frozen frosting and cheesecake; an absolute must try for anyone living in or visiting the area whether it is 100 degrees or not.

VA single sampling of the Almond Concha proved to be light and airy on the interior with eggy notes and a bit of butter beneath a crackling sugar topping.  Definitely something different and definitely delicious despite not tasting much like almond I have to say this item gave me hope for Mexican pastry in general - definitely a place to consider the next time I head down Indian School Road.

V...like the Wynn but without the flowers, and even less useful shopping venues, and worse restaurants.  Sure it is a beautiful property but honestly I'd rather spend less than half and stay at the center of the strip.  The money saved will allow me to eat at non-Wynncore restaurants.

VLowes, Walmart, Paradise, Harkins, and a Bevmo - can't argue with that.  5 miles from my door is another plus.\u000a\u000aMinuses?  Johnny Rockets, PF Changs, Applebees, Olive Garden, and probably the biggest clusterf*%k of chain restaurants I've ever seen.  One interesting dining option in this whole complex would be a stunner, but at least parking is widely available.\u000a\u000aI'll be back - frequently - for the Walmart and coffee at Paradise, but not for much else.

VSee Blog for the full review w/ pics:\u000a\u000aHighlights - \u000a\u000aAfter a few moments my server returned with a block of creamy cow's butter and my first of many visits from the extensive bread cart.  Featuring in excess of 15 breads on this particular evening I was unable to taste them all, however the eight I did manage to taste were all remarkably good.  Served throughout the meal each bread was warmed after selection - selections included Pain au Lait, Saffron Forcaccia, Bacon Epi, Gruyere Brioche, French Baguette, Basil Forcaccia, Compte Cheese Bread, and Basil Forcaccia.  While each bread was good, my strongest recommendations would certainly be the Gruyere Brioche and the Basil Forcaccia - both of which tasted like the very essence of their ingredients.\u000a\u000aShortly after my bread selection I was brought my amuse bouche - and let me again use the word extravagant.  Le Caviar Osciètre en fine gelée de corail anisée, servie en surprise - an item actually from the menu degustation this wonderful dish consisted of a small tin filled tiny black caviar - high quality and ample in portion with a briny "pop" to each pearl served atop a layer of fresh dungeness crab layered in a gelee of lobster coral (lobster eggs) and fennel custard.  Well balanced with the combination of pungent fennel, sweet crab, savory caviar, and a suprisingly large degree of contrast in textures - this "amuse" would likely cost over $50 as a menu item in most fine dining establishments.\u000a\u000aMy first actual course arrived in very short order - literally a minute after the Caviar which I nursed slowly.  Entitled Oursin, poulpe et crevette dans une infusion en gelée vinaigrée aux algues the dish featured Sea Urchin, Octopus and Tiger prawn served in three different sections and encased in a seaweed gelée.  Smooth and only mildly briny urchin, thin and tender octopus, a perfectly prepared prawn with crispy antenna - each individual bite revealed something different and the gelee was only mildly briny in and of itself.  Cutting the overall salty nature of the dish, the addition of small pieces of poached seaweed, small balls of melon, and various spices lent a nice contrast and everything about the dish (including the crystal bowl) was dazzling.\u000a\u000aA supplement off of the degustation ($30 extra when the bill came) was Les Crustacés featuring le homard rôti au curry et fines graines de chou fleur, l'oursin a la purée de pomme de terre au café « Blue Mountain » torréfié, la langoustine truffée et cuite en ravioli a l'émincé de chou vert - essentially three distinct courses on a single plate - all a fascinating interplay of flavors and textures.\u000a \u000aDesigned to be eaten in order, the first option of the three was one of Robuchon's most famous dishes -  truffled langoustine ravioli with chopped cabbage.  Featuring a single plump raviolo filled to bursting with sweet langoustine the dish was paired with chopped Savoy cabbage primed in beurre blanc and the plate was finished with a foie gras and black truffle reduction.  Smooth, creamy, earthy, and unctuous the sauce somewhat blurred the langoustine, but in general the sweetness had no trouble shining through.  While not quite as mind-altering as Achatz's black truffle explosion, the second best piece of pasta I've ever encountered.\u000a \u000aSection two of the trio was roasted lobster with green curry.  Not a fan of curry in general I admit this dish gave me pause but a single bite assured me spice would not take the forefront of the dish.  Impaled with a sprig of lemongrass and served over a melange of lemongrass couscous and cauliflower the overall feel of the dish was actually something akin to the vegetal compositions at Manresa.  While I cannot say I "loved" this dish, it was good and the lobster itself was perfectly prepared.\u000a \u000aThe third selection on the dish was by far the most interesting - Uni on mashed potato with roasted coffee beans.  Featuring the second wonderful uni tongue of the evening served over a bed of truffled mashed potato puree and topped with roasted blue mountain coffee bean foam all I could do was sit back and be wowed - three flavors I'd never consider placing on the same plate, yet perfectly complimenting one another to form an overal taste and texture that (strangely enough) reminded me of a creamy vanilla cappucino at first with the component tastes each peaking through as the spoonfulls traversed the palate.\u000a\u000aLe Sucre - Featuring a micrometer thick shell of crystalline sugar enveloping a ball of mascarpone cream, vanilla mousse, lemon marshmallows, and strawberry pop-rocks the dish was topped tableside with pomegranate syrup - it was almost too beautiful to eat.  Cracking the shell and taking a bite of each layer in a single spoonful I was absolutely stunned by the multiple textures, temperatures, flavors, and nuances of the dish...and then the rocks started popping.  One of the five best desserts I've ever tasted.

VA review of the cheese/dessert tasting is more complete in the blog:  \u000a\u000aDelivered tableside by Theresa and described at length with animal, region, AOC designations, and flavor notes the list was too long to remember but almost entirely French.  Cheeses I managed to note, largely because they are the ones we ordered, included Saelers, Tome des Bauges, Emmental de Savoie, Beaufort, Mimolette, Brie de Meaux, Cabecou, Cantal, Valencay, Camembert de Normandie, Epoisses de Bourgogne, Laguiole, Comte, Morbier, and Bleu de Bresse.  Large portions, easily an ounce each, we received a total of 16 flavors divided into four plates - one ash, one mild and creamy, one pungent, and one aged.  Served with a baguette and walnut raisin roll I personally loved the Mimolette, Brie, Valencay, and Morbier.\u000a\u000aLa Sphère de Sucre - Fuji apple confit, almond praline cake, Tahitian vanilla sabayon, praline ice cream.  The perfect crystal ball shattering with minimal pressure from the spoon, the sweet cream, the supple bread, the ice cream, the fruit - every bit as good as my passion fruit version last fall but even better given my love of apples.\u000a\u000aLa Pomme - Essentially a Baba cake at its base, the choux pastry rested in a creamy and cool Fuji apple mousse and Tahitian vanilla cream, while atop sat a pearl of green apple sorbet and a crispy candied apple fleur.  Buttery and smooth, as beautiful in the mouth as to the eye - the flavor was that of a grown up apple dumpling in heavy cream.\u000a\u000aLes Banans - a meringue sort of Ille Flotant on ice.  With honey mousse at its center atop a mountain of banana ice, the meringue was intentionally unsettled and contained a center of caramelized bananas.  Topped with banana chips and lime zest the dish was intensely sweet to be certain, but at the same time self assured and balanced when everything was taken together.\u000a\u000aLes Banans 2 - the dish would be presented in a long cylindrical glass and the alternating layers would present a parfait of sorts.  With alternating layers of fresh cut banana, house made vanilla wafers, nougat, honeycomb, banana cream, and milk sorbet this dish was perhaps the least "fussed with" of the night (aside from the black plate painted with edible gold pain) but the flavors worked perfectly.  Bite by bite, taste by taste, each spoonful offered a totally different taste and sensation.\u000a\u000aL'Orange - a light and refreshing citrus dessert featuring orange segments poached in an infusion of Ceylon Pekoe tea at top and bottom.  Between the orange layers would be a thin layer of salty caramel, a bruleed layer of yogurt mousse, a quenelle of orange sorbet, and crunchy bits that tasted like pralines made from macadamia nuts.  Tthe flavor profile was actually quite unique and unexpected with the notes of tea actually substantially smoothing out the citrus and allowing the caramel to shine.\u000a\u000aLa Poire - confit anjour pear, foam of almonds and Anisette, pear sorbet.  Largely liquid with small chunks of intensely sweet pear beneath this would be my second dessert with  licorice tones in two days and again it would serve notice that when used with restraint the flavor can be quite pleasant.  With almond top notes and the licorice flavor only present on the palate the dish was a solid palate cleanser for what was next.\u000a\u000aLe Chocolat - Comprised as a sort of parfait, the first dish arrived in a cup with a chocolate shell over the top.  Beneath the shell, chocolate wafers, chocolate mousse, chocolate butter cake, chocolate ganache, and winter fruit confit.  Using 66% Valrhona as the based and some lighter chocolates throughout the dish was exactly what the ingredients would dictate - a little citrus, a lot chocolate, and texturally lovely.\u000a\u000aLe Chocolat 2 - white chocolate sabayon with lemon confit at the base and add the topping of rich coffee Ice cream, chocolate ribbons, and caramelized walnuts.  Hesitant at first as I don't prefer citrus toned coffees let alone lemon and coffee together, the white chocolate cream actually masked the citrus quite nicely and if anything the lemon actually helped to enhance the more floral notes of the coffee and chocolate combination.\u000a\u000aTrolley of mignardises would arrive next with the a selection that included but was not limited to:  Passion fruit marshmallow, salted caramels, confit ginger covered with chocolate, chocolate dome, dark truffle with mint, chocolate covered orange peel, liquid caramel centered chocolate, pinapple pate a fruit, white chocolate bark with puffed rice and orange, a chouxcette, strawberry cheesecake in white chocolate, tuile of almond and citrus, pear gelee filled with brandy, blackberry opera cake, chocolate religieux, blueberry financier, dry pineapple with white chocolate, raspberry praline, canele, white nougat, and at least 15 other selections.  Choices made I'll note the while the canele was a bit soft, the financier, opera cake, pear gelee, and cheesecake were all sublime.\u000a\u000aAmazing.

Having already dined at Joel Robuchon twice myself this was not the first time I'd seen such generosity from the kitchen of "The Chef of the Century" and much like my previous visits the meal was an exercise in refinement; the room, the food, and the service all well-manicured, highly polished, and lavish.\u000a\u000aTaking a 9:00pm reservation and arriving early only to be identified by name as the doors swung open on my approach I was subsequently seated at the same table I'd dined at during my first visit and greeted by a familiar service team including the same dining room manager and server as my prior visit much of what would follow was familiar; the plethoric bread cart and equally impressive cheese course followed by a dessert trolley with nearly three dozen options plus the signature pound cake, though this time smaller than prior.  Deferring on coffee I was additionally treated to a hand clipped tea and infusions cart and a $10 flat charge brought no less than three bottles of Evian - no doubt the cost of admission warrants these things as well as the impressive "Ruby" palate cleanser and "Maize" amuse - gifts that would constitute proper courses at many restaurants.\u000a\u000aMoving on to what was ordered I once again opted to order from the prix fixe as opposed to the larger grand tasting and making a special request for the (menu price $300 if ordered ALC) Pintade Fermiere my only small complaint regarding the entire evening was that Chef Le Tohic felt need to visit my table before the hen's preparation to suggest I'd be better off only ordering half the bird as I'd have gladly (and greedily,) eaten more of the crispy skin and supple flesh sandwiched around thick, buttery, foie gras...though I guess saving the $60 supplement charge was a benefit.\u000a\u000aTruffles, foie gras, uni, foie gras, caviar, and more foie gras plus aged comte, spell-binding desserts, and a room and service beyond reproach I can think of much worse ways to celebrate Christmas Eve than with Joel Robuchon's team at the MGM and although I personally would never do so in a T-shirt there is something refreshing about the fact that in a city where there are so many bad high-stakes bets this is a place where anyone willing and able to spend the money is virtually guaranteed an excellent return.

VWhile I prefer AG and Seven for all Mankind you can't really fault True Religion for being as popular as they are.  Made in America and one of the better companies for making more than just "skinny jeans" I picked up a great pair of white jeans with red contrast stitching here for 1/3 the retail cost and couldn't have been more pleased with the service.

VFull review blogged.  Good, not great.  Highlights below.\u000a\u000aThe Why:  The Number One hotel in Canada according to some sources - Five Diamonds, Relais et Chateau Rated, an off-the-beaten path gem, and an ever changing menu crafted by Chef Jonathan Gushue focused on the best local ingredients available - it seemed a perfect way to end our trip spanning from Toledo to Montreal and back.\u000a\u000aThe Service:  Elegant and formal but decidedly lacking the polish and charm of many similar restaurants I was actually somewhat surprised by the fact that only a single captain and server were working the room that evening.  Perhaps an effect of the season or low number of diners there were periods where water went unfilled, plates sat empty, and presentations were bobbled that I simply would not expect from a restaurant of such stature.\u000a\u000aLavender White Hot Chocolate:  Generally not a fan of floral flavors this was highly recommended by our server and actually quite excellent, a light perfume of lavender with rich smooth sipping chocolate.\u000a\u000aDressed Rabbit with duck liver mousse and Endive:  In my opinion the best bite of the evening, this complementary amuse was perfect - the lean tartare of rabbit melded together by the creamy foie gras while endive and crisp onions kept it vibrant.\u000a\u000aHouse White and Wheat Bread with Salted Aged Butter:  A top ten all time bread service, particularly considering there was only two options - the quality here was in the butter.  Rich and decadent - literally as flavorful as an aged cheese and as good as many in Paris I really have no idea how much of this I ate, but I do know the bread was replenished twice and the butter thrice...and I don't think the ladies were responsible.\u000a\u000aPotato Fondue, Basil, Herb Chips, Sallers:  This was awesome - probably more butter than potato and beautifully accented with the herbal elements while the crispy root vegetables added texture.\u000a\u000aLobster, Partridgeberry Jus, Baby Beets, Parsnip, Red Onion, Rainbow Chard:  My aunt's selection and everything the cod tongue could have been - perfectly executed lobster in a vegetal melange that reminded me of the cuisine out in northern California in terms of its freshness, refinement, and balance.  At times bitter, at others earthy, but all the time with a slight overlying sweetness that played off the natural flavors of the shellfish.\u000a\u000aRoe Deer, Chickweed, Venison Bacon, Navet, Mustard Greens, Sunflower Crumble, Natural Jus:  My selection - served medium-rare by Chef's choice - was small in portion but impressively lean and perfectly gamey, but even cooked perfectly still a bit dry.  Having bathed other proteins in sauces and broths it is hard for me to determine why Gushue opted to go with largely dry accoutrements on this plate given the natural leanness of small deer but all-in-all it was a poor choice, particularly at a $44 price tag.\u000a\u000aDark Chocolate Toffee Bar with Coco Nibs, Soused Cherry Ice Cream:  By far the best of the desserts that afternoon, this was dry like a Kit-Kat yet melted like a semifreddo on the tongue.  Bittersweet but bolstered by the intensely sour ice cream everything here from temperature to texture to taste was nicely balanced.\u000a\u000aPine Scented Lemon Sponge Cake with Toasted Marshmallow and Citrus Frozen Yogurt:  My mother ordered this for the citrus...she enjoyed it.  To me it tasted much like Pine-sol smells.  Texturally interesting to be sure, but most assuredly not my style.\u000a\u000aThe Verdict:  In many ways befitting of its tremendous accolades I couldn't help but depart Langdon Hall a bit disappointed.  For many reasons a 'destination meal,' including location, sourcing, and setting the simple fact of the matter was that for over $100/pp after tax and tip there were just too many uninspiring courses at too much cost.  While I don't doubt that both the front of the house and Chef Gushue's team in the kitchen can turn out an exemplary experience at Langdon Hall it would be hard for me to guarantee it to anyone based on my one experience and even harder for me to justify a return visit unless I otherwise found myself in the area.

VNot as swanky or loaded with Newt Glass as the Scottsdale location but still serving the same great coffee, free Wi-Fi, and friendly staff as all the other Wildflowers this will be my "home base" location for a long time to come.  7 miles from home - straight shot on the 101.  Love it.

VIt reminds me of Panera back home - as a matter of fact, there are undoubtedly ties - but their lack of Equal sweetener is a perplexing omission.  \u000a\u000aMore annoyingly, the employees at this particular location are absolutely cloying - circulating the room like hawks to clear away whatever plate or speck of dust they can find - often to the point of distraction.\u000a\u000aA good soundtrack - Neil Young?  Really?? - but the random internet downtimes and 30 minute restrictions simply make Wildflower a far better choice for my needs.

VIf you're one of those people that NEED the latest trend in jeans (last I checked high quality denim is high quality denim) then this probably isn't the store for you, but if you're looking for a pair of Diesel jeans for ~1/3 the price of Nordstrom then you might want to check this place out.  Great quality products, helpful sales people, and I'm quite okay with the lack of "skinny" jeans that I heard another customer lamenting about - they're ridiculous looking unless you're capable of pairing them with a guitar, heroin-chic figure, or Mic Jagger rockstar attitude.

VSame shoes at 1/2 the price of the stores on the strip - sure the selection is limited, but nothing is stained, damaged, or marked in any way.  Hand stitched from both the luxury line and the slightly more affordable standard collection the one failing of this store is the lack of belts and cufflinks, but for shoes and ready to wear shirts/pants/jackets there are definitely some deals to be found.

VPart 1:\u000a\u000aThe Why:  A work of passion from a former stock trader turned restauranteur, noca had been on my "to visit" list ever since I visited Phoenix for my recruitment in September of 2011, but unfortunately a chef shift right before I visited (and another thereafter) gave me pause.  Owned by Eliot Wexler and considered by many locals 'in-the-know' to be amongst the best restaurants in the city I knew I would eventually make my visit, but it was not until the high praise of new chef Claudio Urciuoli's cuisine and a ringing endorsement from Steve Plotnicki via facebook came across that I moved noca to #1 on my list.  With a concept that seems rather straight forward - high end ingredients prepared with an Italian twist in a casual environment - I generally assumed that noca was going to impress, and at a price point that seemed bargain basement compared to similar establishments in New York, Chicago, and elsewhere.\u000a\u000aThe Reservation:  For the sake of full disclosure I have to note here that I was known walking in the door.  Between Steve's endorsements that I must meet his friend Eliot and another local diner who'd apparently told Mr. Wexler about me months before I figured it was only proper to introduce myself to the restaurant's owner prior to making a reservation - an introduction that led to a string of e-mails covering everything from sourcing to local general contractors, and finally a reservation at 8:30pm on Saturday night (actually secured ~18 hours before the meal via Opentable.)  What I hadn't planned on, however, was a stop earlier in the day to check out the afternoon 'nocawich' menu...but hey, why not?\u000a\u000aThe Space:  Located, like many Phoenix restaurants, in a simple strip mall the exterior of noca is nothing to get excited about - it could be any random sports bar or billiards hall, but what lies inside is actually quite sleek; a sort of urban industrial feel but still sort of homey and laid back.  By day more casual and by night more trendy the use of industrial light bulbs plus spotlights and mirrors allows the room to be as intimate or as bright as necessary and with an open kitchen during both lunch and dinner service there is plenty to watch.  With a lively bar, close set tables lacquered in black, and brick walls plus a lively soundtrack I will say the space gets loud, but certainly not overly so, and for those who enjoy watching a kitchen at work the marble chef's counter is a great place to eat. \u000a\u000aThe Service:  Considering how busy noca was (not an empty seat in the house save for the one to my left) I was stunned at the fluidity and efficiency of service.  Dishes were presented with ample descriptions, questions of ingredients and preparations were answered thoroughly and knowledgably, and aside from a few small quirks (that the average diner would have never paid a second thought to) my primary server named Jenny could not have been more pleasant, professional, or helpful with her suggestions.  A lively spot where many patrons probably don't really pay attention to the quality of the service I'll simply say I've been to a number of Michelin starred spots with a far less impressive front of house.\u000a\u000aThe Food:  A sandwich and dessert at Nocawich at lunch/two drinks, eight courses, bread, amuses, mignardises at dinner.\u000a\u000aCroque Madame with Pork Belly, Brioche, Fried Egg, Gruyere Foam:  This $10 sandwich from the Saturday Noca(wich) menu would feature a slightly modernist update on the French classic and as much as I love the combination of ham, egg, and cheese in all forms this one raised the bar a bit by utilizing tender belly bacon from Mr. Wexler's supplier out of Iowa paired with crisp brioche, a perfect sunny side egg, a thin slice of aged gruyere, and finally an aromatic foam from an ISI Whip that made cheese whiz seem tame in comparison.  As good as the lobtah roll sounded, I find it hard to believe it would have trumped the croque - but I'm certainly going back with my BOGO from dinner to find out.\u000a\u000aRed Velvet Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting:  Simple, dense, moist, and featuring an ample amount of tangy cream cheese icing there really isn't much else to say about this cake.  Not overly sweet like so many 'designer' cupcakes the $3.50 rustic wedge was a welcome change from the norm - the cocoa allowed to shine rather than taking a back seat to the sugar.\u000a\u000aDinner service will be an addendum...

VPart 2:\u000a\u000aBricco Riella Moscato D'Asti:  Moving on to dinner, my night began with a complementary beverage from Eliot - a sweet and light-bubbly DOCG Moscato that was nice for sipping throughout the lighter opening courses and the sort of sparkler I'd gladly drink in place of the typical Prosecco served at other haute-Italian restaurants.\u000a\u000aPB&J:  A second beverage, served later in the meal and suggested by Jenny, consisted of Peanut Infused Buffalo Trace Bourbon, muddled raspberries, and a splash of fresh lemon.  Generally not one to fancy the oakiness of bourbon I have to say the original suggestion gave me pause, but I figured at $10 I could afford to take a chance and as my reward I surprisingly excellent drink with the aromatics of the peanuts pairing with the smokiness of the charred oak barrels to help balance the bitterness of the alcohol while the sweetness of the raspberries came through as a jammy sort of flavor that dissipated soon after it hit the tongue.\u000a\u000aHouse Focaccia:  Somewhat less oily than the average focaccia and served without butter or oil the bread service at noca is serviceable but nothing to write home about; the sort of bread you'd use to mop up sauces but certainly not overindulge on - perhaps a good thing considering the portion sizes (as I'd soon find out.)\u000a\u000aPanzanella Salad, House Bread, Cherry tomatoes:  The night's amuse this straightforward take on a traditional Italian Summer Salad was one bite off a spoon; bold, balanced, toothsome, and nicely tinged with olive oil and vinegar - a nice way to open the palate to the flavors to come.\u000a\u000aFluke Crudo - Sea Beans, Watermelon Radish, Finger Lime:  A gift from the kitchen, I'll start out by saying that in general I don't fancy Fluke - the slight fishiness and snappy texture not really what I prefer in a raw prep - but showing a skilled hand with using sweets and bitters to balance the fish this was about as good as fluke gets.  Doused in oil and lightly touched with esplette the dish had just a bit of kick and a whole lot of flavor; if you like flounder or crudo in general it is definitely worth checking out as the quality of the fish was excellent.\u000a\u000aKing Salmon Arancine with Herb Aioli:  At $7 I decided to take a chance on this one despite my general blasé for salmon largely because I'd heard Eliot and Chef Claudio discussing the quality of the salmon and because I love arancini - and as it turns out, it was an excellent choice.  Crisp on the exterior with flawlessly prepared Carnaroli rice wrapped around rich salmon each of these three balls was just slightly larger than a golfball and paired nicely with herbal aioli not dissimilar from ranch dressing as well as a paste of what I believe was pimento pepper the flavor was anything but boring salmon, but rather like a southern style salmon croquette with far more nuance thanks to the quality of the rice.\u000a\u000aYellow Watermelon Soup:  A palate cleanser before the pastas this small coup of soup was a sort of gazpacho teaming with herbal notes and a slight melon undertone that was both familiar yet unique.  Probably not the sort of thing I'd order a big bowl of, but definitely a refresher between the two seafood openers and the two that would follow.\u000a\u000aSpaghettini dei Martelli with Ft. Bragg Uni, Dungeness Crab, Breadcrumbs:  Seemingly more and more common on menus these days I was happy to learn that noca offers half portions of all their pastas so that I could try this out without filling up too much stomach space (as you'll see, this actually WAS an issue for once) and for $9 this was still one heft serving of pasta with the thin noodles amply imbued with briny urchin butter, sweet shredded crab, and a spoon full of breadcrumbs for texture.  Half the price and just as much flavor as similar presentations elsewhere the only critique I could possibly muster for this dish was that the uni was perhaps a little too thin, losing texture but retaining flavor and thus allowing the high quality crab to steal the spotlight.\u000a\u000aCarnaroli Risotto with Blue Prawns, Leeks, Aji Panca:  Having already noted the quality of the risotto - the handiwork of a young sous-chef standing in front of me all night - this $10 half-portion of creamy rice unfortunately arrived on the heels of the Spaghettini thus forcing me to make a decision as to which would have to suffer a bit of cooling, but after one bite I knew it was the spaghettini sitting out this dance.  Toothsome yet fluffy, spicy but not 'hot,' and a perfect melding of the aromatic leeks and snappy sweet prawns this was probably the most rave-worthy dish of the evening.  A dish often presented but rarely perfected I've been told that risotto is "always" on the menu at noca and if that is the case and it is always this good then I'd suggest there is "always" a reason to visit.

VPart 3:\u000a\u000aRicotta Mousse, Sour Cherry:  Another one bite intermezzo there is nothing to say about this dish that can't be guessed from the ingredients - smooth as ice cream and rich as cheesecake they could have served me a bowl for dessert and I'd have been content\u000a\u000aBerkshire Pork Chop - Speck Wrapped, Manchego & Fennel Stuffed, with Cabbage, Beets, Roasted Peaches, and Peach Togarashi Sauce:  This is where things got silly.  Knowing that I'd ordered a bird for my main course I first thought that this was a mistake, but in reality the only mistake was Eliot sending it with instructions that I should just 'have a taste.'  Wanting to show of the quality of his sourcing, what I received here was a 12oz chop of Iowa raised hog and with the pork itself tended and easily cut with a butter knife Chef Urciuoli opted to gild the proverbial lily by punching a hole in the chop, infusing it with rich Manchego cheese and fennel, then wrapping it in smoky speck before cooking it to a juicy medium well.  Enormous in size and savory as hell, the plate was finished with roasted peaches, spicy peach sauce, balsamic, and a bit of beet puree plus shredded cabbage...quite the intermezzo if I do say so myself.\u000a\u000aBubba's Half Chicken alla Diavola - Prosciutto Wrapped, Cacio di Roma Filled, Swiss Chard, Peperonata:  Following the theme of stuffed, wrapped, roasted, and served in large portion this $23 half-chicken was ordered as my 'main course' and recommended by Eliot by e-mail even before I arrived it would prove to be anything but "just chicken."  Featuring no-less than half the chicken and roasted to a succulent tan what truly made this dish stand out was the deconstructed 'cordon bleu' approach as the creamy ewe's milk cheese lining the interior oozed forth with each bit while the slight gaminess of the prosciutto added brine to the already crisp skin.  Knowing here that peppers atop such a long day of eating would necessitate Tums, Pepcid, or both I sampled lightly of the pepper stew and only wished I'd have been able to enjoy more as the sweet peppers, garlic, and herbs were lovely but at this stage of the game still too much acid and heat even as I picked around the hotter peppers intertwined.\u000a\u000aGreen Apple Cotton Candy:  Declining coffee when Jenny made the offer she went to ready the bill - a bit of a misstep as I surely was not going to skip dessert no matter how full I was - but thankfully Eliot caught her in midstride and ordered two desserts for me...plus a big twirl of this cotton candy, the flavor of a green apple Jolly Rancher spun into an puffy cloud.  \u000a\u000aWalnut Cake and Compressed Fuji Apple with Dairy Free Vanilla Bean Sorbet and Cider Broth:  Described as a dacquoise by the pastry chef but utilizing almond in place of the traditional almonds or hazelnuts this light meringue was served atop compressed balls of apple and finished tableside with apple cider.  A light dish in texture but full of flavor I particularly enjoyed the clean finish of the sorbet - an intense vanilla that was heavy on the palate but light on the swallow and serving to meld the walnuts and apples nicely.\u000a\u000aTriple Chocolate Flan with Maldon Sea Salt and Praline Rice Crisps:  Whatever the walnut cake lacked in heft was more than made up for in this one - a 'flan' in name only from my standpoint, though I'm sure some gelatin was involved, this was a proper budino that I'd have finished no matter how full I was.  Featuring a top later of dark and a second layer of slightly-less-dark chocolate and topped with just enough salt to create contrast I particularly loved the fact that the bulk of the sweetness was derived from only four little pieces of praline plus a caramelized cookie at the side.  Call it a flan, call it a budino, call it pudding, pot du crème, or panna cotta...it is really quite good, and more than enough to share.\u000a\u000aChocolate Chip Shortbread:  A parting gift, just in case you haven't had enough - it was buttery, it was crisp, and at this point I couldn't help but think "it's only wafer thin" as I ate it on the car ride home.\u000a\u000aThe Verdict:  To say my experience at noca was the same experience every diner has had/will have there would be a bit naïve - I know for a fact there were special circumstances tilting the tables in my favor, but with that said it isn't like I was receiving "off item" specials or anything the rest of the room couldn't order and in that case I'll simply say that anyone can and should go to noca with the expectation that whatever they order will be made from the finest ingredients and prepared with an adept hand by a skilled chef.  Having had a number of good-to-great meals in Phoenix both during my recruitment and since settling here noca is the first place I've been where I truly feel like I could become a 'regular,' thanks in part to the quality of the food, the ever changing menu, the comparatively low prices, and finally to Mr. Wexler and his team.\u000a\u000aJust go.

VFull review blogged, high points here.\u000a\u000aThe Space:  While I have heard some complain that Christopher's is inside a swanky shopping mall I counter that commentary by noting that the best restaurant in the United States shares the same dubious distinction and with Chef Gross visible front and center of the open kitchen with wrap around bar I was impressed by Christopher's the moment I walked in.  Bathed in light from the outside at first and then dissipating to a romantic glow as the sun set both the lounge and the dining room at Christopher's have a modern but refined feel with white tablecloths, fine service ware, and comfortable seating abound while the walls are minimally adorned with single flowers, wooden art, and mirrors.\u000a\u000aThe Service:  Pleasant, descriptive, whimsical, and efficient James did a great job of working with my friend's allergies while additionally being sure water was always filled and bread was replenished as necessary - an admirable feat as he was probably the only captain on our half of the dining room thus quarterbacking at least four back servers working perhaps twenty tables without ever missing a beat.\u000a\u000aThe Food: Wood Oven Pizza with Foie Gras, Andouillette, Boudin Noir & Goat Cheese:  An 8-slice oblong pie clearly focused on decadence I must say that I was hesitant to order pizza in a French restaurant but this $26 dish worked astonishingly well.  Beginning first with the lightly charred crust - sturdy and smoky with a great chew - and moving next to rich and lightly brined chevre I was immediately impressed by the quality of the base and moving on to the trio of offal things only got better as the creamy melting liver, briny blood sausage, and onion-laced crumbly pork all melded into a complex flavor that was at once mineral and pungent but also slightly sweet thus preventing it from being overly rich.\u000a\u000aTerrine of Mousse of Foie Gras served w/ Brioche:  My first course of the prix fixe was a nearly 2 ounce slice of creamy foie gras topped with Hawaiian black sat served with golden brioche, greens lightly dressed in vinaigrette, and three dots of reduced Balsamic.  A very traditional preparation, particularly next to the pizza, this was my third foie gras course of the day and although the least 'unique,' a very smooth and well sourced product served in surprising portion for a $40 prix-fixe.\u000a\u000aPied du Cochon with Brussels Sprouts, Mustard Seed, and Smoked Bacon:  For our main courses Aileen opted for the Steak Frites while her sister chose the Dover Sole Meuniere and while I didn't taste the former but quite liked the simplicity of the later I was more than happy with my choice of two flaky pastry shells stuffed full of crispy trotters alongside caramelized sprouts and a sauce of smoked bacon and fresh mustard seeds.  Intense and savory, well balanced with the pungency of the sprouts, and just a touch of earthy heat from the mustard this was another bistro style dish slightly reimagined that impressed even despite my overall distaste for mustard, an ingredient that here acted to enhance the salty pork rather than mute it as is sometimes the case.\u000a\u000aDaily Gnocchi with Onions, Belly Bacon, Taleggio, and Cream:  For $8 this was an absolute steal of a side dish as there were no less than fifteen tender dumplings swimming in a pool of bubbling cheese and cream tinged with bacon and onions.  Admittedly getting full at this point in the day, particularly as I'd eaten 3/4 of the pizza myself plus a few slices of bread I made sure I finished each dumpling, particularly those where the cheese had browned to form a bit of crunch, but I still regret sending a good portion of the creamy cheese mixture back to the kitchen rather than applying it to another slice of baguette.\u000a\u000aTarte Tatin with Vanilla Bean Gelato:  My prix fixe dessert, and another enormous portion, was this rustic apple tarte tatin with buttery caramelized apples juxtaposed against a crisp pastry shell alongside drizzles of crème anglaise, salty caramel, and a tuille cup filled with rich vanilla bean gelato.  Now three for three in the frozen confection department this was a lovely representation of "French Apple Pie" and while I still prefer America's take on the dish this was certainly a memorable dessert teaming with butter and not overwhelmingly sweet.\u000a\u000aChocolate Mousse Tower with Berries, Espresso Crème:  Having joked with James that it seemed odd not to serve the dish that Chef Gross prepared with Julia Child as part of her tribute menu he had to agree but for $10 extra it would have been foolish to pass on this lovely cylinder of white and dark chocolate stuffed with light chocolate mousse and berries as a supplemental dish.  Topped tableside with a light espresso cream and nicely balanced with fresh blueberries, strawberries, and blackberries against the lightest chocolate tones of the evening I can certainly say this dish is worth the praise it receives and a great deal of impact on the palate for something so light,

An ornate space clearly befitting its trendy nightclub roots with friendly, though somewhat cocktail-pushy service and excessive hyperbole (no, your chef did not 'create' the cronut, nor was he the first to coat chicken with the cap'n) it was with the aforementioned bread basket, freely refilled coffee, and a cocktail that our meal began and with the basket particularly impressive given its complimentary nature it was much to my delight that the rest of the cuisine followed suit; substantial delay due to our waiter flirting with two tables full of sorority girls notwithstanding.  Electing to sample two sweets and two savories it was with a trio of selections and the smooth, dense, and semi-molten-centered bread pudding to follow that our meal progressed and attempting to abstain from exaggeration I will simply say that if I returned I'd be hard pressed not to order the exact same thing, the French Toast harkening a fruit infused Bostock and the pasta a peerless example of knowing how to use truffle oil with restraint, the end result a dish warranting an extra slice of focaccia to sop up every drop of the eggy aromatic cheese.

VI like Walmart, but this one pales in comparison to the one at NorTerra.  From the limited selection to even more limited cashiers everything here ALWAYS seems to take longer than it should and while I appreciate their "one stop shopping" approach I somehow think they'd be better off having more than two lanes open than having an optometrist, hair salon, nail salon, bank, and credit union.  Dirty floors and dim lights plus a large crowd - I'll drive up 7th Street to NorTerra from now on.

Truly a 'mom n' pop' red sauce sort of place, said in the most complimentary of ways, with a full service bakery up front and walls strewn with signed celebrity photos, maps of Italian neighborhoods in various locales, and kitschy décor it was at a long table in the rear of the restaurant that we were seated and with superlative service, ample beverage refills, and enough food for a party twice our size the nearly two-and-a-half hour meal  could not have better met expectations - each plate perfectly prepared, well presented, and unquestionably delicious.  Beginning first with an opening volley of house-baked bread and supple garlic knots before progressing to fried options including creamy lasagna explosions and toothsome rice balls in bright, aromatic sauce it was at the second 'proper' course that the meal truly took flight, a trio of pizzas ranging from simple cheese and garlicky white on lightly  charred crusts alongside a pillowy 'Margherita' on buttery, thick focaccia-style crust that easily ranked amongst the best 'grandma slices' I've had to date.  At this point sated but certainly not stuffed it was with great spectacle that our final savory course arrived and featuring two platters each of Eggplant Parmigiano,  Housemade sausage and meatballs smothered in marinara, and a bounty of fresh squid/shrimp/sea snails/mussels smothered in creamy white sauce plus a bowl of supple braised tripe the table was literally covered as eyes stared wide - leftovers a guarantee, though all ate heartily with favorites varying from person to person and the tripe a personal favorite, especially atop slices of warm bread from the refreshed basket.  Taking to heart the gluttonous portions provided thus far dessert was ever so slightly scaled back as hot, spongy Zeppole dowsed in powdered sugar and filled-to-order cannoli both shined brightly while Rainbow cake, Butter, and Almond cookies were spot-on authentic  - a characteristic shared by a hot sfogadella that I requested as I paid the bill, ostensibly for 'later' had it not been so perfect...the creamy citrus filling beneath shattering layers not even making it to the car, no matter how full I was.

VItems Selected:\u000aBrioche French Toast with fresh whipped cream, ice cream, raspberry sauce\u000aAlmond Croissant\u000aChocolate Brioche\u000aBaba au Rhum\u000aPear Star\u000a\u000aConsistently on a mission to find quality French pastry regardless of locale I was admittedly a bit surprised I'd not heard of Bonjour Bakery until just last week, the small strip-mall shop located just off Rainbow Boulevard suggested by a former Las Vegan during a conversation about things he missed most about Sin City.  Easily overlooked by those not looking but featuring friendly service and a consistent stream of locals throughout my hour long visit a trip to Bonjour begins with the nose as the fragrance of butter beckons at fifty feet and with a small kitchen menu plus two long cases filled with viennoiserie and entrements plus a wall full of bread difficult decisions abound, my eventual order entailing four pastries and a plate for less than the cost of five Sprinkles cupcakes or an equal number of croissants at Bouchon.  Beginning first with pastry as the kitchen went to work it was with regard to the warm almond croissant that I first exclaimed 'wow' as a sugar sweetened shell shattered to tooth giving way to subtle nuttiness and a wispy interior awash with butter, all of it Parisian standard without a hint of sticky frangipane.  Moving next to a plump baba that could have used just a touch more booze and then to a fruited pastry harkening a kouign amann in its laminated edges but more a galette at its custard core the second 'wow' of the morning arrived in the form of swirled brioche - a warm coil of eggy batter with great stretch wrapped around dark chocolate that had me lusting for the cinnamon raisin version just as the 'piece de resistance' arrived featuring that same brioche starter sliced and soaked in custard with a caramelized surface topped with berries, cream, and a dollop of slowly melting vanilla bean ice cream - the whole of it and of the restaurant both unexpected and 'incroyable.'

VI don't drink and I don't smoke, but I LOVE sports.  In late September I found myself in Vegas and the Buckeyes were playing the Golden Gophers with Terrell Pryor set to become king of Columbus.  Having had breakfast at Bouchon I stopped by the bakery for a wonderful muffin and made my way to the Palazzo sportsbook where I met my friend to watch the game.  \u000a\u000aIn a word, heaven.  Huge plush seats, plentiful and enormous screens, smoking only on the patios, and difficult enough to find that it was 1/2 full (given, it was 9am.)  My buddy and I sat on the patio, he smoked a cigar, I drank coffee, and we watched the Buckeyes on one tv, spartains on another, and the Gators LOSE on another.\u000a\u000aSure my parlay got smashed when the Wolverines crushed the worthless badgers, but at least I got to watch the rest of the Big 10 in great surroundings.  Better than Caesars, better than Mandalay Bay, no drunken dolts.......and service from young people.\u000a\u000aI can't comment on the food, but it appeared to be elevated bar food.  I dug the jerseys and layout as well.  GREAT place.

VHaving heard Phoenix dining doesn't often extend past 10pm I was admittedly surprised by the people waiting out the door but judging from the number of halter-tops and guys wearing sun glasses at night I quickly realized that The Mission was not all about "dining" after all and on my new friend's arrival we exchanged greetings and made our way through the crowd, across the patio, and into the dimly lit room.  Setting prejudices aside and deciding to let the food do the talking I was pleasantly surprised.  Full review with pictures is in my blog, highlight dishes are below:\u000a\u000aWith the kitchen moving surprisingly quickly despite (or perhaps because of) the late hour it would be perhaps fifteen minutes before our first course of the evening would arrive and although something I'd not have traditionally ordered the Almejas Al Vapor would prove to be well worth its "best in the valley" designation.  Described as Peruvian in origin and served in a large low-bowl along with dense "pan de yucca" bread with a good sponge for dipping this complex amalgam of spicy aji Amarillo chile powder, tender clam stew, rock shrimp, chorizo, roast corn, basil, garlic, and turmeric was everything its ingredients suggested and then some - hot and spicy, smoky and garlicky, sweet but saline, and all the while complex without being overwhelming.  While I personally could have stood for just a bit less salt and a touch more sweet to temper the spice this was a small quibble balanced nicely by the sweet rolls.\u000a\u000aFor the second of this round of appetizers my favorite plate of the meal would be presented as "Duck Carnitas Empanada," an invariably upscale take on the traditional empanada with a golden flaky shell harboring orange glazed duck confit and an admixture of habaneros, mushrooms, cilantro, and queso Oaxaca.  Delectable on its own but certainly open to further adornment the empanada was subsequently topped with a chunk of seared foie gras and finally with a foie fortified queso Oaxaca pan sauce and a drizzle of tamarind oil with the end result sweet, savory, and totally decadent.\u000a\u000aLeft with a bit more time to digest and a lot less noise as the restaurant's population had literally dwindled by half a mere forty-five minutes after we were seated the final savory of the evening would arrive just after 11pm and as I was doing the ordering it just so happened to be a second round of my favorite fowl, this time the "Green Chile Duck Confit."  Ample in portion and more so in flavor this pile of two legs and two thighs featured a whole lot of duck for the dollar but unfortunately was just a bit less crispy than one would have hoped - a small quibble as it was not greasy, but not "textbook" confit by any means.  Again spicy without being "hot" the duck subsequently topped with sultana serrano peanut mole and paired on the plate with savory "cheesy fried hominy" that tasted something like a cross between popcorn and corn nuts plus smoked mushrooms to help ground the rest of the flavors.\u000a\u000aFor dessert The Mission's Pumpkin Bread Pudding with Scotch, Caramel, Pepitas, Pomeganate, and Chipotle seasonings was quite outstanding.  Beginning first with the pudding, almost a steamed sticky pudding in texture, the flavor of the pumpkin, cinnamon, and clove was present in spades and the scotch tones blended nicely with the sweet caramel giving it all a heavy handed boozy bite.  With a touch of spice from the chipotle cooled by quickly melting dulce de leche ice cream I additionally found a lot of appeal in the pumpkin seeds and pomegranate with their respective salty and sweet crunch adding some texture.\u000a\u000aA modest tab, particularly when split, we opted to divide the bill down the middle and with that we made our way to the streets where, as I'd been told, few people were to be found at 11:30pm even on a Saturday.  Saying our goodbyes I made my way to my car satisfied with my meal at the Mission and realizing that perhaps my bias against "scene restaurants" was a bit unfounded, much like my preconceptions about "Southwest cuisine" - a fitting conclusion to my first trip to Arizona and a bit of reassurance that I could undoubtedly live here.  Sure the city shuts down early but to be completely honest by the time we left The Mission it was already nearly 2 hours after my typical bedtime anyway.

VNice spot but prices are a bit higher than they should be for the meats and produce; that said, provided a great Saturday morning where, for us, a bit of shopping (if you've not been, do yourself a favor and go purchase some compound honey butter from "Nourish"), a dense butter cake from "Classic Cakes," and a crisp-gives-way-to-yawning-caverns-of-butter-and-light-frangipane Almond Croissant from "Five Star Frogs" bled over to an admittedly over the top tasting of pastries from local baking legend Tammie Coe that started in Old Town and extended on to the Camelback market...and later to her store on Roosevelt.

Equally impressive, a long list of Mexican-influenced food proved to be high quality and well-priced - the pork mole smoky and aromatic while the duck was gamey and tender with bits of cracklins' tucked in for texture.  Falling on the other end of the spectrum, I'd urge everyone to pass on the dreadful miniature almond croissant, limp and cool to the touch for $2.50, as well as the flavorless and doughy $4 bread pudding and instead order a crepe - or walk down a few feet and sample the flourless chocolate cake for free...or better yet, walk to the back of the market and buy some sweets from Tammie Coe.\u000a\u000aHonestly though, if someone can name a place else where one can order a really good duck tamale appetizer, a piping hot Neapolitan Pizza main course, and a pair of fluffy soufflés at 9:00am while perusing fresh local produce and artisan goods please let me know.  Add in the fact that amongst the local artisans are Tammie Coe pastries and frequently local wine makers sampling out their wares in the warm Arizona sun and I'd be hard pressed to name a more unique experience in the greater Phoenix area - at least from October until May when all the snowbirds leave and the heat index is over one-hundred degrees by the time the market would normally open.

VOddly, as I was eating my croissant I received a text from my friend who I was to eat lunch with later that day - he had made it to town early and was going to be stuck at the Olympia all afternoon - he wanted to know if we could make it breakfast instead.  Certainly not full after two small pastries I agreed and he suggested we meet over at the Wynn - near the poker room.  As previously noted, I'm usually a man with a plan when it comes to eating on vacation so the walk over to the Wynn provided me ample time to think of a good spot - eventually deciding to get out of the Wynn, check out Encore, and grab breakfast at  Café Society Encore.\u000a\u000aArriving just after 9:00am I was surprised to find the large restaurant packed and my friend and I opted to sit at the bar rather than wait 20 minutes for a table.  Seated promptly and provided with menus our drink orders were taken - a coffee for myself and a $9 (ouch) vanilla protein shake for my friend.  While he noted the shake was tasty my friend was admittedly shocked when the bill arrived - even using the best whey on the market there is no way this shake was more than $1 worth of ingredients.  My coffee, also expensive at $4 for a relatively average brew, was refilled slowly at best - and only when I asked.  All this despite there being two bartenders and only one other person at the 10-seat bar.\u000a\u000aPlacing our orders next my buddy opted for the waffle with blueberries, a side of egg whites, and an English muffin - all of which he stated were good but "overpriced" while I myself chose the Frosted Flake French Toast with Caramelized Bananas and Chocolate Cream.  Arriving after a relatively short wait the dish contained two pieces of brioche dipped in frosted flakes and topped with perhaps one half of a caramelized banana plus a small dollop of creamy but decidedly unchocolately chocolate cream.  Taking an initial bite I have to admit the quality of the bread itself was marvelous and the bananas were wonderful while the chocolate lacked.  Adding a few tablespoons of pure Vermont maple syrup definitely helped the dish - mostly by adding a bit of sweetness but also by bringing forth some of the more subtle vanilla and cinnamon tones of the bread.  A good dish, but at $15 nearly twice the price of the vastly superior and larger French toast at m.henry in Chicago and more expensive than either Keller's or The Country Club's wonderful bread-pudding-style French Toasts in Vegas. \u000a\u000aSitting for a while and chatting with my friend - later making plans for another brunch a couple days later I was glad that we were not rushed out but a little disappointed that I had to ask more than once for a coffee refill and that my water glass was taken away after a single glass and never returned.  In the end the total cost for the meal was nearly $50 for food that was good but not great and service that was present at best.  Paying our bill we walked away largely unimpressed - having had breakfasts at multiple places in Vegas now I'd steer clear and make my way to Bouchon, Mon Ami Gabi, The Country Club, or Tableau first - for the price you could even cab it to Hash-House-A-Go-Go and eat cheaper (and perhaps better) - but then if you did that you probably wouldn't have room for lunch and dinner.

V...the clerks are helpful enough, I guess, but there is something about the overhead lights at Lowes' (all of them) that makes me dizzy and unwell feeling.  I'm not sure if it is the buzzing, the color, or the combination plus the slight woody smell of the store but I can literally only spend 30-40 minutes here before I simply must leave.  Nice selection, good prices, but as a soon-to-be-homeowner with improvements to make I get the idea I'll be looking elsewhere.

VOne of the larger books on the strip and full of comfortable seating including rotating lounge chairs I've spent a good number of vacations plus time as a local seated in the MGM Race & Sports book with a great time ensuing nearly every visit.  Mostly isolated from the gaming floor and not as smoke heavy as that at Caesars or Venetian there is simply a nice vibe to this place that has only been improved by adding TAP across the way.  Admittedly crowded at most times and a bit of a hassle when the Hakkasan line begins to develop I guess one can look at this as a pro or a con depending on how vested they are in the game; those cheering for the favorite and happy to check out the velvet rope eye candy should be quite happy.

VNice looking place and they seem to do good work but the substantial number of attempted up sells is unsettling.  Combine this with a generally rude and impatient cashier plus your typical uppity North Scottsdale crowd and I'd be hard pressed to return.

VAmple parking, 40+ high end shops, and ever impressive customer service paired with that signature scent present since the day they opened their doors I really cannot find fault in Crystals aside from the prices which, although high, match the luxe goals of the shopping center.  From Tom Ford to Bally and Paul Smith to Prada the wares here are as much art as they are fashion and whether you're buying or browsing the architecture and public art alone warrants a look.

Quiet in a good way with cheesy 80's music playing overhead and as much kitsch and scripted-happy service as I'd expected it would be mere seconds after I was seated that coffee was filled and with both my friend and I favorite sweets to savories our decision was simple - both items arriving after numerous coffee refills in all their gluttonous glory.  Understanding that Serendipity is more about fun than fine dining it was really no surprise that the bottom slice of French Toast was somewhat dry due to a lack of whipped cream saturation and although decent certainly nothing I'd order again and yet what was surprising was the high quality of the Waffles - both golden and crunchy on the exterior with a soft, pliable inside and nicely balanced between sweet and savory by the balsamic strawberries and chocolate.  Satisfied but unwilling to leave Serendipity without sampling one of their signature sundaes the meal was capped with the carrot cake version, a substantial chunk of dense cake complete with cream cheese icing buried in ice cream, walnuts, fudge, and whipped cream that really had no chance of failing in the flavor department if you enjoy sweets, though perhaps a touch less 'subtle' than some like their breakfasts...or lunches...or dinners.

A 'mom 'n pop' outfit to say the least it was only the chef and 'his lady' that I encountered in the course of my thirty minute stay and with stories and suggestions aplenty an order was patched together from personal favorites and chef's favorites, the latter mostly what was warm from the oven and each item save for a slightly dry cupcake impressive.  From the nutty, laminated bearclaw to creamy bread pudding and a cream boller marrying concepts of a croissant and a Religeuse with its two types of cream half of each item was cut and sampled with the second half reserved for a friend and while deciding on a favorite is a difficult task I think the deciding factor was one of temperature; the buttery cinnamon roll with frosting still runny versus the custard Danish, still warm with a jiggly sweet center not unlike a Portuguese egg tart - itself an impetus to visit Henderson again soon.

Large in size primarily due to the presence of the retail store and deli but with ample seating for guests in both the dining room and small lounge I was greeted first by the man who would serve as my waiter and then by a manager who seemed to know every other patron in the restaurant, both inquiring as to whether it was my first visit and offering suggestions regarding the menu - some accepted and some discarded in order to focus on items I knew to suit my fancy, each and every one a lesson in rustic Italian cooking with top quality ingredients, great depth of flavor, and ample portion.  Beginning first with hot garlic bread paired with olive oil and balsamic before progressing to an even more garlicky plate featuring eight tender snails on crusty bread with rich sauce I was shocked when the next two plates proved to be even better, one a 'salad' of crisp spinach topped with tender portabellas baked in parmesan cheese sauce and the other a pile of dainty potato gnocchi resting in smoky pork cream brightened up by fresh double shucked peas.  With each plate undoubtedly heavy yet finely balanced with no ingredient unnecessary or overwhelming the others it was with a touch of sadness that I realized I only had room for one dessert but deferring the tiramisu and strawberry cake for a later date I do not regret my decision to order the baba one bit, two slices of boozy rum cake lightly sweetened with confectioners' sugar and a ripe strawberry the only garnish necessary...plus a cannoli filled a la minute on the house, as though I needed further food or reason to return in the near future.

We also found them offering service, in our case from a woman named Deanna that was far from ideal as items were forgotten or delivered to the wrong table while water refills were non-existent.\u000a\u000aLoud and boisterous, particularly the large group of Steelers fans in the other half of the restaurant, I actually enjoyed the setting at Arcadia while the food, mostly, was competent with the pizza falling flat due to a flavorless crust and underwhelming cheese while the trio of bruschetta were simple but well prepared with good ingredients on crisp yet toothsome bread.  Moving on to better things, the pulled pork was actually a highlight; meltingly tender on buttery little rolls and spiced without being spicy.  Equally good, the pretzel was golden, buttery, and plenty to share (without the ridiculous upcharge for cheese like the average pretzel at Brat Haus) while the dessert cookie was exactly what you'd expect - still scalding hot in the skillet and crispy atop with a near-pudding consistency within, the flavors buttery and tinged with cinnamon plus a lot of semi-sweet chocolate chips - a great comfort food classic, though the ice cream was mere carton quality and did the dish no favors.  \u000a\u000aBetter than BW3s, for sure, and actually pretty good by sports bar standards I'd consider going back, though I'd love to know when the nebulous breakfast/brunch ends since no one on the phone could tell me (I hear 12:00 from some, 2:00 from others, though we arrived at 11:50) and I'd skip the coffee - and pray for better service.

Yet another of the many spaces that locals and 'food nerds' overlook I'd strongly recommend stopping by the Parlor to anyone craving a good pizza but unwilling to wait for Bianco - I'd also urge them to order dessert from one of the few places in town turning out great sweets without the assistance of Tracy Dempsey.

V...I don't know why I subject myself to Best Buy, I really don't.  Overpriced, meager selection, and quite possibly the least motivated employees ever I went here to use up a gift certificate that was about to expire and although I can't complain too much about prices since "free is free" the fact that I had to wait in line for twenty minutes listening to pop-Christmas overhead was enough 'cost'  to make it seem like it wasn't worth it.

A truly beautiful restaurant, tucked away from the Casino in in typical Mina fashion (Michael Mina Bellagio, Stripsteak, Pub 1842, etc,) I was seated in a corner booth and greeted quickly with a glass of champagne and electing for a cocktail to go with dinner my meal began promptly with Chef Mina's classic corn bread in a muffin form and doing my best to temper eating these by the dozen I still managed to order a second basket as I progressed through six savory courses and two rounds of dessert inclusive of amuses and palate cleansers, plus sides paired with my final savory.  Focused squarely on the sea with fish generally out of the waters no more than 24 hours each and every plate that arrived was prepared to a lightly cooked exterior and delicate rare internal temperature, the tender scallop balancing a creamy piece of foie gras and the shrimp and grits particularly impressive while the lion fish was flaky and light, beautifully complimented by the brine of the mussel chowder and smoky pork.  Always happy to overindulge on dessert, even though the hush puppies were like sweet and savory crawdad doughnuts, the team at American Fish continued the trend of very impressive sweets that I've seen from Baltimore to Detroit to Vegas and San Jose with a quartet of options where doughnuts and bread pudding both shined and cheesecake wowed; the lightness of the mascarpone something I generally don't anticipate in the dish but truly impressive in the setting of light vanilla cream and reduced berries.

VFull review in the blog.  Highlight courses below.\u000a\u000aI must say that the dining room at Sage is amongst the most dramatic in Vegas.  High ceilings, excellent spacing, minimalist art on the walls, plenty of dark tones and piano finish, plus ample lighting at each seat without being too bright between tables - the word "sexy" comes to mind immediately.  With ambient forgettable music playing overhead the location and setting does not hide the fact that you are in Vegas, but at the same time you feel miles away from a "casino restaurant."  Not as secluded as Savoy, Robuchon, Twist, or Alex, but a different experience entirely - Sage feels accessible, a place where a drink and appetizers, a course or two a la carte, or a tasting menu are equally valued and nice jeans and a button down shirt look just as appropriate as the Tom Ford suit you could buy next door.\u000a\u000aBeginning the menu proper my first course would be perhaps Sage's most famous dish - the Foie Gras Creme Brulee with Blood Orange, Gran Marnier Glaze, Cocoa Nibs, and Salted Brioche.  Cracking the crisp crust and taking a bite the custard was ethereal - light yet harboring the very essence of liver with notes of egg, orange, and cocoa largely detectable on the palate more so than the tongue.  Eating slowly each bite was as good as the last and pairing the custard with the crunchy and buttery brioche was every bit on par with the best torchon I've ever had - at The French Laundry - and if possible Sage's version was even lighter and more flavorful.\u000a\u000aAlready abuzz with anticipation of what could follow such an incredible opening act my second course would prove equally competent.  Titled Yukon Gold Potato Gnocchi with Smoked Ricotta Cream Sauce, Truffle Puree, and Parsnips the pasta was absolutely flawless - pillows of potato accented air that dissolved on the tongue.  Utilizing crispy parsnips and fresh spinach for textural variation while liberally topping the plate with fresh shaved truffles and a pleasantly subtle cream sauce with hits of parsley and chive the entirety of the amalgam tasted something akin to a baked potato with the aroma of truffles.\u000a\u000aAs good as the foie gras and gnocchi were, my favorite savory of the meal would turn out to be the fourth course - Slow-poached Organic Farm Egg, Smoked Potato, Shaved Winter Truffle, Toasted Country Bread.  Always one to favor egg dishes, everything from the presentation to the flavor of this course was immaculate.  Served in a bowl at least 1 foot in diameter with a creamy foam of creme fraiche topped with shaved truffles as the only visual stimulus on arrival, the smell of the dish was that of truffle and smokiness.  Plunging my spoon deep and piercing the creamy egg I mixed slowly while enjoying the aroma before taking a bite - smooth potato gratin, creamy egg, the mild tang of the creme fraiche, and the aroma of truffle rising to the palate.\u000a\u000aMy sixth plate would prove to be another stunner - and the best duck I've yet to experience in Las Vegas.  Titled Grimaud Farms Duck, Celery Root Puree, Confit Leg, Heirloom Apples and also featuring crispy Fried Kale and Black Mission Figs the duck itself was meaty without being gamey and fatty without being overly so.  With crispy skin the three one ounce slices of duck were perched atop an unctuous and salty confit of leg while the plate was topped with a reduction of fig and balsamic.  Sitting at the base of the plate, a pave of celery root topped with apples and figs - bitter and sweet, multi-textured, and seamlessly melding with the duck forms above.\u000a\u000aWarm Brioche Bread Pudding with Roasted Pecans, Myer's Rum Sauce, and Brown Butter Ice Cream was absolutely the best non-chocolate bread pudding I've ever tasted.  Soaked through yet delicately crisp on the exterior the buttery brioche was spongy without being wet or heavy.  Topped with a thick and boozy sauce and then with a quenelle of rich and buttery ice cream the dish found contrast in temperature while crunchy pecans proved a crunchy foil to the otherwise soft and intensely sweet dish.\u000a\u000aThe first dinner in a truly over-the-top week of eating, I still look back fondly on my experience at Sage.  Call it Midwestern sensibility if you like, but there is simply something to be said for the elegant yet accessible nature of what McClain and team are doing at Sage - the space, service, and prices are nothing like the top tier of Vegas dining - but the experience and food every bit as impressive.

VDishes selected include:\u000a\u000aMoochin Monkey Bread\u000a\u000aShort Stack of Donuts with Raspberry, Chocolate, Caramel\u000a\u000aSugarfoots Dancing Chicken and Waffles with Wild Turkey Amrican Honey maple syrup\u000a\u000aCinnamon Bun French Toast with Tableside Flambe Bananas Foster, Anglaise\u000a\u000aHot Mess with Waffle Fries, Brown Ale Chili, Spicy Cheese, Eggs, Crema, Bacon, Sausage, Jalapeno\u000a\u000aPerhaps it should come as no surprise that the signature Las Vegas outpost of celebrity Chef Sammy D went belly up shortly after my December visit; it was loud both visually an aurally, could not/would not turn on any NFL game besides the Cowboys despite multiple TVs and title of First Food & BAR, and even by Sin City Standards the prices were high while the vibe/décor bordered on too-hip-for its-own-good...and yet at the same time I must admit that despite all these failings and the fact that service was more eye-candy than efficiency I kind of enjoyed my meal there.\u000a\u000aPerhaps as a result of having spent the morning at Public House where my friend already acquired a good beer buzz or perhaps due to my guilty-pleasure soft spot for upscale comfort food and/or kitsch takes on American classics the best way I can describe First Food & Bar - both the experience and the cuisine - is "fun," each dish a little more audacious than the last with large portions, tableside preparations, and excessive ingredients aplenty.  Ranging from shockingly simple and delicious donuts to unique and elaborately presented French toast to the doughy and tedious Monkey Bread our sampling of sweet items ran the gamut and moving towards the savory - two options ordered by my friend - both the chicken and the waffle were as well prepared as any while the waffle fries...let's just say the name says all you need to know, and one or two was definitely enough (though my friend claims otherwise, to which I say "drunk food.")\u000a\u000aSporting the moto "Hard to find but easy to love" due to their obscure location in the shoppes at the Venetian I'm not sure I entirely agree with that sentiment, but I am glad I went - even if I probably would not have gone back even if they had remained open; a "once is enough" sort of place to be sure.

VArriving early at The Mandarin Oriental for my 7am reservation I first had to navigate the space between Crystals/Aria/Mandarin Oriental.  While the Claes Oldenburg piece is certainly interesting and well placed, the directions to the Mandarin front door are not.  A walk, a 2 foot elevator ride (couldn't find the stairs,) more stairs, a doorman, and finally an elevator to the 23rd floor eventually found me standing at the hostess podium where I was greeted pleasantly by a pair of young Asian women - one of whom would end up being my server, Kristy.\u000a\u000aOffered a free Newspaper (Times, Journal, or USA Today) I opted for the Times and was led to a comfortable seat near the window.  With soft wood tones and plenty of natural light throughout the room and a mild ambient soundtrack playing overhead I'll note that the restaurant was largely empty with only three other couples dining during my 90 minute breakfast.  With that noted, Kristy was an exemplary server and beverages remained full with her checking in on me frequently, asking about where I was from, and making small talk without being invasive at all.\u000a\u000aBrowsing the menu I'll note that the prices at MoZen are not at all cheap - but the quality service, room, sourcing, and preparation are worth the cost.  With orders placed my coffee was filled (Illy) and I browsed the provided selection of Staud's honey and jam while waiting.  To start my meal I was offered an amuse from the kitchen - a yuzu infused grapefruit "elixir" that was intensely tart but surprisingly sweet - a great way to awaken the palate, though not particularly a great match for the coffee.\u000a\u000aFor my first course (yes, I ordered two breakfasts since I couldn't decide on one) I opted for the Croque Madame featuring  grilled sourdough, Serrano ham, Gruyère cheese, sunny-side up eggs and gratin of Mornay.  Served with grilled vegetables and a side of apple wood smoked Kurobuta pork bacon, the Croque was excellent, albeit somewhat small and underfilled compared to that at Comme Ca, Bouchon, Morels, or Fleur.  Flawless eggs topping smooth and delicate ham, the sourdough itself was nicely toasted and the cheese/Mornay combination proved a mellow foil to the salty ham - all told a solid Croque, but probably not justifying the $19 price tag.\u000a\u000aWith at least my third refill of coffee (I lost track, but at $7 I figured I'd drink to my heart's content) poured it was only a matter or 15 minutes reading about the Islander's woeful season before my second dish would arrive - this time Walnut-Banana Bread French Toast.  Featuring "thickly sliced warm banana and walnut bread, lightly battered and pan-fried with whipped cream and Vermont maple syrup" this was one of those dishes that tasted every bit as good as it sounded.  While I generally prefer my French Toast in the custard style, using a hearty bread like Banana Walnut in this case allowed a crispy caramelized exterior while the bread itself maintained its characteristic pastry-like consistency.  Topped with warm and bubbly fresh syrup and creamy whipped butter (no whipped cream as noted on the menu) the taste and texture of dish was closer to dessert than breakfast and the flavors went very nicely with the coffee.  A hearty portion at $18 the price was still high, but I'd definitely order this one again on a return visit.\u000a\u000aFinishing the French Toast Kristy asked if the chef could send out one last taste and I agreed without question.  While I cannot recall the official name, the item I received was delivered by the chef himself and described as a warm "donut."  Essentially a pate a choux similar to a large gougere but stuffed with warm vanilla custard the pastry itself literally melted in the mouth leaving behind a warm splash of creamy vanilla - while not exactly a donut, if it were a donut it'd be the best I've ever had.\u000a\u000aSettling the hefty bill (about the same price as their Sunday brunch after tax and tip) I will note that Mozen was the most expensive solo breakfast I've ever attended, but at the same time it really is not out of line with what one would pay at Bouchon or Tableau and the food was just as good while the service was actually superior...and all three are equally tricky to locate.  Packing me up a cup of coffee and two extra "donuts" (no charge) to go I thanked Kristy and the woman at the reservations desk for a lovely meal and got lost, again, en route to the lobby.  Next time I'm in Vegas I'm heading back to MoZen for the brunch - assuming I can find it.  For now I'll just call it a hidden gem and hope that others discover it for themselves.

VItems Selected:\u000aSpinach & Artichoke Dip with Toasted Pita\u000aMuffaletta Pizza - Cappicola, Mortadella, Salami, Tomato, Mozzarella, Olive Salad, Pistachio\u000aFoie Gras Burger - Half Pound Blended Angus topped with seared Foie Gras, Sauteed mushrooms, Caramelized Onions, Foie Gras Black Truffle Aioli with Truffle Parmesan French Fries\u000aEmeril's Free Range Buttermilk Fried Chicken - Coleslaw, Mashed Potatoes, Whole Grain Mustard Sauce\u000aJalapeno Cornbread\u000aSweet Potato Fries with Cinnamon Sugar Dipping Sauce\u000aEmeril's Banana Cream Pie - Graham Cracker Crust, Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings, Whipped Cream\u000aNew Orleans Bread and Butter Pudding - Whiskey Crème Anglaise, Whipped Cream\u000a\u000aMy history with Emeril Lagasse dates back as far as my interests in fine dining, a meal at his eponymous Orlando restaurant serving as a gift to my mother long before I had the finances or background to explore things more extravagant, and as much as years have passed while palates have evolved the quirky celebrity chef has always held a place in my heart - a Saturday evening visit to his branded Stadium and Sports Book again proving his recipes despite limitations of venue and service.  Chosen for dinner during Kings vs. Blackhawks Game 3 it was with friends that I found myself seated on the Strip-side patio of The Palazzo property and with low tables arranged around individual LCDs as a sub-60 degree cross-breeze rendered things quite chilly our meal progressed in three courses, the plates themselves thankfully arriving from the white toques of the kitchen while beverage refills and service languished at the hands of unapologetically undertrained staff.  Formerly visited as Jay-Z's 40/40 Club many years prior and largely unchanged in theme or décor since it was MMA and NBA that dominated the warmer indoor seating and admittedly a bit perturbed to begin my mood soon changed as Los Angeles took the lead and food began to arrive, an opening volley of creamy $10 Artichoke Dip and an $18 golden disc spot-on for the flavors of NOLA's signature sandwich both delicious and big enough to share.  Shying away from items like shrimp and grits previously experienced at other Emeril locales round two of the meal continued the bar-food trend and while the liver on the burger was overcooked and meager the patty, fries, and aioli all shined - a compliment even more befitting the juicy fried chicken whose crunchy batter and hefty spice profile rival the best in the Valley.  Ever happy to indulge in dessert, even after the sinful frosting-paired sweet potato fries, it was midway into the third period that I finally placed an order and arriving just as the horn sounded the meal ended just as it did over ten years prior - an ethereal bread pudding rife with vanilla and booze alongside a slice of the Banana Cream Pie equally responsible for building an empire as the word Bam!

VPricey without a doubt and admittedly the sort of place that not everyone will "get," Scottsdale Pen Company is a gem for those who fancy esoteric writing instruments - whether for functionality, or as an artistic statement.  A beautiful collection that is extensive yet well culled and workers who are passionate and knowledgable these folks not only helped me find a mechanism I'd been looking for in an old pen but also had ink available at a great price for another pen that I generally have to special order in any color but black.  Great stuff and a nice location for browsing after coffee at Cartel I'll certainly be back.

VWith a whole day of eating including a 26-course masterpiece at Binkley's behind me the second day of my trip to the Valley would be a clinic day...starting at 8:00...which of course meant a 10 mile run at 5:00am was not out of the question, nor was breakfast beforehand, in this case a place recently brought to national attention by (insert synonym for annoying) food personality Guy Fieri - Over Easy Café.  Not particularly a fan of Fieri but having found some of his recommendations to at least be interesting (and in the case of Rino's Place occasionally outstanding) the restaurant fit my time frame as well as location and as such I decided to give it a go.\u000a\u000aArriving shortly after the doors opened at 6:30 Over Easy Café was easily located via GPS and attached to the Phoenix Coyotes Ice Den practice facility I allocated parking quickly and after a quick browse of the rink I made my way into the café - a starkly decorated seemingly converted office space with a breakfast bar and Formica all around and with a few tables of patrons already seated I was greeted at the door with the suggestion to sit anywhere I like.  In this case electing for a two-top near the doors I took my seat where silverware wrapped in napkins along with the menu were already in place and grabbing a copy of the local paper I started to peruse the menu moments before service would arrive, a pleasant young lady named Samantha who appeared to be the only server working the room.\u000a\u000aClearly a place for regulars as nearly ever patron to enter after me was greeted by name Samantha welcomed me and filling my water asked if I'd like coffee while I perused the menu; an offer I gladly agreed to when I noted that they were serving the same locally roasted Café Cortez as the day prior at Morning Glory.  \u000a\u000aWith my coffee being readied and having already perused the online menu I would be ready to order by the time Samantha returned and with the time just before 7:00 I opted for two dishes, both garnering a "good choice," and sat back to read the paper and listen to the overhead radio while I waited perhaps fifteen minutes for my plates to arrive.\u000a\u000aWith service efficient and friendly throughout my stay and coffee maintained near full along with my water my two plates would arrive simultaneously and having heard some (Food Network) call Over Easy the best breakfast in the state while the posters on the walls hailed Fieri's commentary I started first with their signature item of Waffle Dogs, three chorizo spiced pork breakfast sausages on sticks dipped in the house waffle batter and fried to a golden brown and dusted with powdered sugar.  Warned that these were hot in temperature but mild in flavor Samantha suggested a combination of maple syrup (not authentic maple, mind you) and hot sauce as a condiment for this and first tasting the Dogs themselves and then with syrup and sauce I had to admit they were better dressed but not terribly impressive either way.  A bit spicy and a nice blend of sweet and savory the overall impression was that yes, this was kind of like a corndog, but without the cornbread and thus inferior.  Light and without oiliness the crispness was appreciated, but overall rather lacking for a "signature" dish.\u000a\u000aMoving next to my second selection, the better of the two by some degree, a half order of Caramelized banana & pecan French toast was delivered - a dish that would clearly be tasty based simply on ingredients, but actually a nice preparation with the single slice of buttery brioche crisp on the exterior and custard like on the inside topped with fresh bananas, crunchy pecans, and a thick caramel sauce that tasted good on the toast and equally delicious spooned into my coffee.  Certainly not a breakfast for those lacking a sweet tooth one slice was definitely enough, especially after the waffle dogs.\u000a\u000aWith a coffee offered for the road and the clock just shy of 7:45 I accepted the to-go cup and after paying the admittedly modest tab plus tip made my way from the restaurant en route to clinic along with the newspaper housing and sports sections that I was encouraged to take along with me.   Overall a nice place with good service I cannot say I'd go out of my way for Over Easy, but considering its location I could certainly see it making a great breakfast spot after a morning skate - goodness knows it would have trumped the Denny's or Bob Evans I frequented after hockey as a lad.

VIt was largely curiosity that brought me in the door and as much as I don't fancy packaged candies and the like I must say the selection was impressive and the overall feeling of the store is quite inviting.  From house-brewed sodas to pop celebrating famous dictators and candies both new and old there is a whole lot to discover here...and if that isn't your thing, well, I guess you could pick up a Justin Bieber cutout or a "grow your own girlfriend" novelty to go with the bacon cola or sweet corn soda.

VVegas-y, nice enough, and didn't smell like smoke.  Pretty much your standard Casino without a lot of personality but overall clean, upscale, and with friendly patrons and employees.

Without a doubt a 'cute' shop with friendly service provided by a young lady named Brenda it was just after 7:00pm when I walked into the small store and with a short line fronted by a woman and her daughter planning a 'Sweet 16' party I spent some time perusing the items and chatting with other customers, seemingly each with a different favorite amongst the store's nearly twenty options.  Featuring plated desserts, custom cakes, jars, cookies, and other take-home treats it was with an eye on variety that I ordered when I approached the front of the line and self-selecting a few favorites along with two selections confirmed by Brenda to be as good as the crowd had suggested I made my way to the door immediately indulging in a buttery cinnamon-laced snickerdoodle with crispy edges and a soft center, the first of a half dozen +1 items tallying $25 after tax and tip.  Showing some restrained and retaining the rest of my purchase for the twenty-seven minute drive home it was with coffee in hand that I continued my tasting first with a bananas-foster-esque cupcake that was plenty moist but somewhat marred by overly sweet frosting but moving on to the dense peanut butter blondie things improved substantially, the dense square loaded with rich chocolate tones and roasted organic peanut butter, a classic combo only improved after a minute on a warm skillet.  Moving finally to what has seemingly become LoVullo's 'signature' item, it was with a quartet of macarons that I rounded out my evening and with each palm-sized cookie featuring a characteristic crackle over rich flavors, the texture of the crmb was actually far more dense than the Parisian classic - a moist cake-like consistency akin to the American whoopie pie and although perhaps not 'traditional,' entirely delicious - both the dense chocolate dipped Snickers and rich, savory Fig and Goat Cheese "Whooparons" undoubtedly justifying the nearly hour-long round trip...though if they ever decide to expand I definitely see a market for a second shop in ever trendy Summerlin.

VThe full post is blogged, the plate summary is below:\u000a\u000aSitting, watching, and enjoying the energy of the room moments after my friend from the prior week's dinner at The House stopped by to say hello it would not be long before crusty bread and clean, herbal, and grassy olive oil would arrive and quickly on its heels was more bread, but this time a substantial upgrade in the form of "Chopped Chicken Liver Crostini with Fig Chutney" featuring warm and toasty bread topped with rough cut chicken liver, rougher cut figs, a bit of pistachio and some chives.  Rustic as hell, savory but sweet - a good start and a sign of things to come.\u000a\u000aArriving quick on the heels of the crostini and garnering the majority of my early attention due to temperature components, Fried Green Tomatoes with Green Goddess and Feta would prove to be the highlight in an evening full of them and without a doubt the best tomato based dish I've had since my first visit to Alinea.  Still a touch sour and retaining all of its snappy texture despite a quick dip in the fryer each medallion of cornmeal crusted tomato was a shock to the palate and well balanced by the tangy cheese with a substantial vegetal component added by sour cream, chervil, lemon, pepper, and what may have been avocado this plate sang a song of late summer with every bite as good as the one prior.\u000a\u000aHaving already mentioned FnB's aptitude for pacing but informed by my server that people were finishing up earlier than anticipated and thus they'd not need my seat for LnL I heard the young chef before me inform the rest of the team to start working on my next course as I reached the final bites of the crostini and within fifteen minutes course two arrived as a complete trio with a main and two sides, none with meat and none needing it either; to quote a non-vegetarian friend "you could make a complete meal out of just the vegetable side dishes and walk out happy."\u000a\u000aBeginning first with the main course as it was actually the weakest of the evening's savories, the "Pasta, Lobster Mushrooms, Tarragon, Corn, Peas, Pistachio Crumb" was not a 'bad' dish by any means, but at $25 the house made rolled noodles, butter, and fresh vegetables it simply did not live up to the price tag.  Obviously not one to quibble prices of quality ingredients I certainly see where Charleen was going with this dish but even at $5-10 less it was just pasta, a bit of olive oil, vegetables, nuts, and fungus - the later two together dominating the flavor and texture profile to the point where the rest was superfluous.\u000a\u000aFine with the pasta but wanting to be wowed like I was by the tomatoes I found salvation in both "sides" and if I were forced to choose which I liked better I'd likely suggest the "Spaghetti Squash Almondine" in one breath and the "Roasted Carrots, Pine Mushrooms, Garlic Butter" in another - the former featuring tender strands of the sweet gourd touched with pepper, oil, and a generous helping of toasty sliced almonds and the later carrots in different degrees of preparation paired simply with rich butter, mounds of tender mushrooms, and a healthy compliment of garlic; a perfect bite found in the charred carrot and a particularly hefty 'shroom on a slice of bread dredged in the garlic butter.\u000a\u000aEssentially incapable of skipping dessert after such a good (okay, fine, any) meal I was hoping for bread pudding as an alternative to the pudding I knew I would be having a few weeks later at the FnB/noca showdown I was disappointed when the answer was panna cotta and thus went with the Butterscotch Pudding, Fresh Whipped Cream, Nutmeg hoping it would be as good as the rumors - and to that, I guess it depends which rumor you believe because for me it was good, but in the end entirely unmemorable as the use of unflavored whipped cream did a nice job of balancing the sweetness of the pudding but did nothing in terms of texture rending each bite the same as the last in terms of taste and texture.  A spoonful would have been enough.\u000a\u000aAdhering rather closely to the previously noted time restrictions and finishing up the last bites of the pudding around 9:05 my server next arrived with the clever Ipad billing system and $90 (after tax&tip) later I was bid farewell by servers and staff before making my way to the streets of Scottsdale where even on a Sunday night well-heeled folks were out drinking, dining, and having a great time - though undoubtedly on less 'wowing' food than much of what I'd just enjoyed, regardless of price.  A meal that certainly fell far short of perfection yet at the same time the sort of place I'd return with minimal hesitation I will admit that I don't think FnB comes close to the designation of "best restaurant in Arizona," but with carrots and tomatoes that had me reminiscing meals at Michelin 3* restaurants there is no doubt that there is something special going on in that small kitchen on Stetson.

Knowing Charleen Badman's skills with meats, and more so local produce, I figured that giving the restaurant a second look with family in tow would not only be more fun, but also allow me to sample more of the ever-evolving menu and on both counts I was correct, though unlike my first visit not everything wowed.\u000a\u000aPerhaps a fault of the season, or perhaps secondary to the pending move and a jammed-packed house my second trip to FnB (and third meal cooked by Badman, including the Fried Chicken Face-off at noca,) everything at the restaurant just seemed slightly 'off' that night - servers abrupt, pacing off, and the price/quality/quantity ratio all skewed to the left while the sunchoke dish was nearly flavorless and the falafel too dense, served luke-warm, and the majority returned to the kitchen without comment (from our table or the servers.)  Additionally underwhelming considering the $14 price tag was the petite portion of a relatively common cheese - though the accoutrements were all exemplary.\u000a\u000aMoving on to what worked - that can be more or less summed up by the rest of the plates; from the creamy hard boiled duck eggs topped with briny olives to the famous leeks and riblets, on to the best Brussels sprouts I've ever encountered and some truly inspired desserts - the persimmon cake particularly with a carrot-cake texture that fused brilliantly with the intense ice cream from Sweet Republic.  More relaxed than my first visit, but at the same time also with less "wow" moments I still contest that although there are plenty of things that FnB does very well it is no more than a "local" restaurant and a far cry from what many have designated it as "The Best in Arizona."

VFull review in blog:  High/Low-lights below.\u000a\u000aWhen the food did begin to arrive, however, we figured out why there was a delay - instead of batching our dozen dishes into waves, they were about to be served all at once.  With plate after plate after plate arriving and filling the table I asked Adrian why this was happening and suggested slowing things down to which he responded "this is a tapas restaurant, sir, it is how things are served."  Having already assured himself a lousy tip by this point I explained to him that although I've never been to Spain I have been to a multitude of Andres and Garces spots, plus other "tapas" style restaurants and have never seen anything like this.  Without apology I watched him amble off to the kitchen where he actually stopped two servers carrying plates (they would have been numbers 8 and 9 on the table at once) and after this service did improve, mildly.\u000a\u000aPlate six was Mediterranean stew in deconstruction | prawns | bronzinni | sofrito, the first of the more "modern" tapas.  Familiar with European seabass I think the cut we received was a bit close to the tail and the fish's generally sweet taste was much brinier than expected.  With the prawn slightly overcooked and rubbery the seafood on the plate was fortunately brought up a notch by puréed sweet potato and "sofrito" of garlic, olive oil, tomato, and onion.  Taking bites of everything mixed did indeed harken to a seafood stew, but not an exceptional one in any way.\u000a\u000aThe final plate in the first (self limited) wave was the best "modern" tapas of the meal - tuna-raspberry skewer | ahi tuna | "molecular" raspberry | wasabi | sesame seed.  At $14 the portion/price ratio was poor, but the flavors and quality more than made up for it.  With the "molecular" aspect a similar texture to a gelee, the sweetness of the raspberry was nicely tempered by the heat of the wasabi while the pan seared tuna coated in sesame seeds lent heft and crunch to the dish.  At the same time visually appealing, texturally intriguing, and tasty this was the sort of dish I had expected when walking into Julian Serrano, though I'd have personally preferred sashimi style from the fish.\u000a\u000aThe second dish, Wild mushroom soup | shiitake | crimini | oyster | foie gras cream would prove to be another excellent classic dish spruced up with modern technique.  Similar to my favorite mushroom soup of all time (Canoe's creamless Mushroom soup) but topped off with foam featuring the unctuous sapor of foie gras.  Taken on its own the soup itself was hearty, earthy, and minimally sweet - the cream simply added a whole extra layer of flavor.  This, along with the subsequent dish would prove my favorite of the meal.\u000a\u000aOverlooked by myself but ordered by my mother, Creamy risotto | wild mushroom | manchego cheese | natural jus was the steal of the menu at a mere $10.  With a base of flawless rice cooked in mushroom broth the dish found heft in the addition of creamy mushroom broth (quite similar in flavor to that on the salmon) while slices of fibrous mushroom added textural variety.  Topped with a slice of slowly melting year-old manchego that added its characteristic aged salinity the entirety of the dish was flawless - I was especially thankful to receive this in the second wave of dishes as I imagine it would not have been as successful in the cooled state.\u000a\u000aWhere the tuna skewers succeeded, Lobster-pineapple skewer | lobster tail | "molecular" pineapple | sesame oil failed.  Whether it was the small portions of overcooked lobster or the over sweetened and disconcertingly fibrous pineapple gelee I cannot be certain, but the dish was simply unbalanced and any nuance that may have been intended was lost in the sweetness.  As the final fish dish of the night I'll simply say that aside from the octopus the kitchen at Serrano really needs to pay attention to the textures coming out of the kitchen as nearly every fish was overcooked.\u000a\u000aTax and moderate tip included the total cost of the meal turned out to be ~$55/person - not a bad deal considering the fact that we ordered four dishes per person and did not pick based on price.  With that said, when a chef like Serrano attaches his name to something there is an expectation that follows and that expectation was not met.  Overcooked fishes, muddled flavor profiles, and service gaffs (especially the sort where the server tells the diner he/she is wrong) have no place in such restaurants and considering the superstar competition that just arrived in town with two restaurants at The Cosmopolitan these are the sorts of mistakes that could send diners looking for better.

Seemingly a cuisine underappreciated by many Americans, or at least most frequently enjoyed 'on the cheap,' yet one whose bold flavors I'd previously seen brought to new light by exemplary ingredients in both Toronto and New York it was just after 7:30pm when my friend and I arrived for dinner and seated at a plush two-top given full vantage of the room's center dining area it was with stellar service from a team of at least a half dozen that the night progressed; a cocktail, quartet of savories, and a single dessert plus complimentary cookies served in three courses with every plate stunning in quality, quantity, and presentation.  Starting off with a duo of creamy true/goose foie gras with pronounced sapor balanced by light pepper and seared caramelization served alongside four "medallions" melding concepts of Crab Rangoon and Shrimp Toast it would be difficult to name another spot in the States to find a better version of either, yet progressing to the 'main course' it was soon that round one disappeared to the ages as Chef Chi Kwun Choi's farm raised Peking Duck arrived tableside to be deftly carved and plated by a veteran service team claiming to have performed the ritual "at least two thousand times," the crisp and meaty skin placed delicately on bao and in pancakes with crisp vegetable and aromatic hoisin before the rest of the bird was taken to the kitchen to be disarticulated, deboned, and presented hot, supple, and ever so rich.  Rounded out with large, lightly fried prawns and candied walnuts topped with delicately honeyed mayo over chilled winter melons and finally six small dumplings filled with silky Kahlua cream plus a duo of gifts for the table it would be easy for me to say Blossom was the best Chinese restaurant I've experienced to date but taking it one step further I'd place it amongst my ten best meals in Las Vegas; food, room, and service rivaling some of the French, Spanish, and Italian Masters at a slightly more favorable price point.

VItems Selected:\u000aChocolate Torte\u000aCroissant\u000aChocolate Twist\u000aPeanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookie\u000aBanana Nut Chocolate Chip Muffin\u000aFinancier\u000a\u000aHighly praised by locals and viewed from the highway on my Monday to Wednesday commute the lone factor preventing me from visiting Olivier Brouillet's "Baguette Café" to date was the weekday only hours, an understandable choice given the restaurant's business-park locale but a pity for those living within the somewhat Un-Vegasy constraints of a 7:30a-5:00p Monday through Friday schedule.  Small in size but airy in décor it was just after eight o'clock on a PTO Monday with family in town that our trio made way into the brightly lit room and with a few locals lingering over coffee as fresh baked goods stocked a small pastry case it was mere seconds before Olivier greeted us with a smile, our affirmation to his "first time?" inquiry leading to a full description of nearly every item ready or soon to emerge from the kitchen and our eventual order comprising the majority of them.  Admittedly intrigued by the sandwiches but preferring to focus on pastry it was with mild disappointment that Illy was the only brew offered as I find their over-roasted beans poorly suited for much but with this small quibble aside the glut soon to arrive would by-and-large impress, the simple  croissant on par with those of Paris as shattering layers gave way to echoing caverns of butter while four items laced with high quality chocolate each proved superlative - the crispy rimmed cookie near-molten at its core and the torte rich in taste but ethereal in texture.  Not quite as impressive or diverse as Bonjour Bakery, La Belle Terre, or Thomas Keller's Bouchon but featuring a combination of great pastry and lovely service that sets it apart Baguette Café is every bit the local gem that many have claimed and although hours and coffee will prevent frequent visits I've no doubt I'll find my way back eventually if not for a full meal at least for thing; an almond financier beyond my superlatives warrants any presumed hassles of location or time, even rush-hour on the 215.

VItems Selected:\u000aLas Vegas Mix - Butter, Sea Salt Caramel, Yellow Cheddar\u000aS'mores\u000a\u000aLocated steps from my door with a second shop in Henderson Laurie Sabol's "Popcorn Girl" was one of those places I knew would find my patronage eventually, a visit from family proving a perfect opportunity to stop in for welcoming gifts...and a whole lot of sampling.  Tucked away in one of the many nondescript strip-malls along the urban sprawl of West Charleston a visit to Popcorn Girl begins ten-feet from the door with the beckoning smell of butter and on opening the door to cross the threshold the welcome builds in a sea of fresh, smiling faces happy to discuss the store's artisan style and 100+ choices of house-made popcorn, candy, and fudge.  At first a bit overwhelming in variety as bright hues decorate a variety of tins and four different menus it would take mere seconds to identify me as a first timer and handed a menu-map plus an invite to sample "as much as you like" I took full advantage - butter popcorn still warm, salted caramel sticky and sweet, and underwhelming vanilla discarded with recommendations to try the 'birthday cake' - a similar base lightly battered and dredged in cake mix.  Served in sizes ranging from $2 to designer party baskets well into the hundreds samples of Butterfinger, green apple, and bananas foster would follow and eventually settling on two mini-bags to compliment my guests' arrival baskets the results were well received; both the marshmallow and graham mixed S'mores and customized Las Vegas mix earning well earned praise for a total tab under $8.

VThe best Paradise Bakery and Café in the Valley thus far - well stocked, clean, lacking the screaming children, no limits on the WiFi, and a flatscreen TV showing sports - plus they have Equal and Coke Zero in addition to NutraSweet, Splenda, and Diet Coke.  I'll be back.  Frequently.

VWith a room full of Robuchon gifts leftover our fourth day would have been an easy one to sleep in and eat breakfast in the room - but why do things easy when there are so many great places to dine in Las Vegas?  Despite my multiple trips to Sin City in the past I'd regretfully been without a car on past visits and as such never been able to visit the local legend of "twisted farm food" - Hash House A Go-Go.  Having heard that a third (the other in San Diego) location of the famous spot had recently opened in the Imperial Palace and waking up early as ever we made our way to the restaurant around 8:00am without reservations and found only 3-4 tables occupied.\u000a \u000aWith late eighties classics blasting we made our way to the hostess podium where we were greeted by a young lady clad in jeans and a HHAGG shirt who led us to a four-top big enough for eight - no doubt Hash House does everything big.  Taking a seat we were soon greeted by our server, Noelle, a pleasant young woman who was substantially more cordial and efficient than necessary at such a restaurant (a good thing, for sure.)  Menus in hand we were left to decide while a mountainous eggs benedict passed by en route for another table.  Hilariously enough, while we were waiting a group of six young men approached the hostess stand and then left because "oh man, we thought this was a buffet."  Clearly they'd not seen the portion sizes.\u000a \u000aSitting and chatting while coffee, water, orange juice, and tea were filled we decided to order only three items and share them around.  With prices ranging from $7-$17 we were informed that one of us would have to pay a $2 split entree fee - when I chuckled saying okay the response was "you'd be amazed how angry some people get about it" - clearly I'm jaded.  Sitting back and listening to Rock You Like a Hurricane while sipping the surprisingly good coffee the restaurant slowly filled up.\u000a \u000aArriving in less than 20 minutes the portions were precisely as expected - enormous and delicious looking.  With a sweet, a savory, and a "dessert" there was too much food for four people.  Beginning first with the Blackberry Granola Flapjacks, my sister's choice although I'd lobbied for the Snickers Flapjacks, the pancake itself was enormous - literally the size of a car tire in diameter though thankfully not as thick.  With ample warm syrup and butter to spread there was really nothing subtle or nuanced, it was just good cofort food and the sweet blackberries worked nicely with the crunchy honey granola.\u000a\u000aPerhaps the most famous Hash House dish would be my order - "Sage Fried Chicken stacked with our famous bacon waffle, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks."  Golden and crispy the chicken was amply accented with sage and actually quite delicious.  Stacked above and below four golden waffles loaded with whole strips (not small bits like other places) of salty bacon and topped with crispy leeks plus a sauce that was much more maple than caramel I have to admit that this was a huge portion of food.  While clearly not as subtle and refined as Bouchon's chicken and waffles I actually much preferred this to Roscoe's famous Los Angeles version and the less famous option at DC's Founding Farmers.\u000a\u000aOur dessert would be Andy's famous Bread pudding topped with ice cream and served with a cup of coffee.  With the coffee alone costing $2.50 on the menu this bread pudding is the deal of the breakfast menu at a mere $7.95.  A portion easily large enough for two hungry people or a family of four to share after dinner the pudding was essentially a black and white coffee cake that would have filled 3/4 of a standard loaf pan.  Buttery and rife with chocolate the steaming hot pudding was then topped with melted Snickers bars, doused with chocolate and caramel syrups, then piled high with two large scoops of vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and crumbly brown sugar.  Like the other choices there was nothing subtle about this caloric monster but honestly for all its audacity it was really quite good.\u000a\u000aSettling the bill (about $14 each after tax and a 25% tip) and returning a large portion to the kitchen (we still had P.U.B. leftovers and the Robuchon basket in the room) we thanked our service team and made our way to the door accompanied by Eddie Van Halen's Eruption.  Generally a fan of refined flavors, elaborate cooking techniques, quiet dining rooms, excellent service, and great food Hash House A Go Go wasn't exactly my kind of place - but the service was excellent and the food was pretty darn good.

VNot a golfer, but living literally 20 feet from this course it is a very attractive layout with a sort of Links style design.  As a runner I personally love the multiple paths with variable elevation snaking throughout the holes and with good lighting even in the early morning hours I've put a number of miles under my feet here without a bit of hassel from the grounds crew who is out working the fairways quietly at 4am every single day.

VIt is actually quite impressive how much this franchise accomplishes with so little A) Money, B) Fan Support, C) History.  As a rival of my beloved Kings I really cannot solidly "support" the 'yotes, but I definitely feel for them and really hope they can find a local owner interested in helping them keep some of their talent.  Seriously, have you watched Keith Yandle play?  If not, perhaps you should.\u000a\u000aGone are the days of the awkward Coyote Goalie logo and rick-rack jersey all now replaced by classy white and maroon plus a pretty solid Coyote logo.  Figure these facts in with Doan and Yandle, one of the NHL's best new arenas, dirt cheap tickets, and free parking - you should probably check them out.....it isn't like the Suns are going to be playing this year.

VPretty much the largest Wal-Mart I've ever visited and quite well stocked, as well.  Generally not one to visit Buckeye this location is extremely convenient when taking the I-10 home from Los Angeles and as such saves me from having to stop elsewhere from groceries on my way back home from vacation.  Same low prices as other Wal-Marts and well maintained plus the added benefit of multiple self check-outs, my only gripe is the lack of manned checkouts aside from the 20-items or less lanes - relatively speaking there should never be a line of 8 guests waiting for one of two checkout lanes at 2pm - not here, not anywhere....just open a few more lanes, and if necessary hire a few more people.

VIn an industry often beleaguered by pretense and cries of 'snooty' service, it would be easy for the folks at Cartier to carry a 'better than you' attitude, particularly in Las Vegas where the rich and famous often swoop in to party and live life lavish, but perhaps as a testament to the classic nature of the brand I've never once received anything less than superlative service from the folks in any of their stores - the shop at Crystals my most recent experience where a young sales associate named Lorenzo Aduca spent no less than thirty minutes discussing watches, mechanisms, and models both modern and defunct with me even after I told him I was not yet ready to buy, but merely weighing the brand versus others.  Always beautiful, always classic, and now featuring in-house movements on nearly all of their automatics I'm still not 100% sold on where or when I'll add to my watch collection, but there is no doubt Cartier will figure into the conversation in large part due to their strong commitment to their clientel.

Obviously not the shop's target audience as I'm neither female nor five and certainly not content to be condescended to by the tiny male attendant who refused to sell me a half dozen - one of each flavor - because they only had two dozen left in the store it was begrudgingly that the little fella even broke conversation with another mall employee to accept a Yelp! check-in lowering the $12 dozen to $10, and taking the small plastic clamshell downstairs to enjoy the frustration continued with each bland bite...the saving grace an impressive "sticky fingers" harkening a moist tres leches cake, though certainly not on par with that at Drago Sisters.  First taking into account the obscure location plus a layout suggesting a clothing boutique rather than a bakery and then tacking on limited selection, disinterested service, and $1 selections the size of a Ping-Pong ball I really can't think of a single reason why anyone would visit this store when so many superior options exist nearby...a sentiment I generalize to Tivoli Village as a whole thus far, though Echo & Rig remains on the short list.

VItems Selected:\u000aVanilla Dossant\u000aCinnamon Sugar Dossant\u000aRed Velvet Cupcake\u000aChocolate Cupcake\u000a\u000aHaving tried to visit Caked once prior, when a sign on the door pronounced them closed "on 11/28," during a day that was in fact the twenty-eighth of April, I decided to give the small bakery a second chance on the Saturday before Mother's Day, the result an experience I'll not soon forget as snooty service, limited selection, and truly awful product collided in disastrous fashion.  Citing slow sales as an excuse for a mere four cupcakes and three styles of "Dossant" for sale just ten minutes after opening I stood rather perplexed as the short server glared at me and asked "so, what do you want?" and deciding I'd rather not have wasted the trip a quartet was selected - the low $10.58 tab yielding hastily bagged rings and cakes smashed in a plastic clamshell.  Limited in seating and unpleasant in demeanor it was to the Starbucks next door that I proceeded for my tasting and sampling each item in the warm sun a "get what you pay for" theme soon emerged, the copyright-infringement skirting crispy fried croissants tasting suspiciously of old oil while cupcakes proved dry and dull beneath competent, mildly sweet frosting - my unconfirmed suspicion that "slow sales" meant I was purchasing Friday's unlabeled leftovers from people unhappy to be at work on a Saturday.  One of the worst bakeries I've experienced in Las Vegas or elsewhere I can only assume something has changed dramatically at Caked in recent months as older reports suggest both variety and skill.  Poor in selection and unpleasant in manner there are far better bakeries throughout Las Vegas and having left more than 75% of what I purchased in the Starbucks wastebasket I'm rather certain even that overpriced corporate giant proves a better value on the dollar.

VFull review at the Blog - high points below:\u000a\u000a"Dirty Chips" consisted of a large pile of house cut kettle chips topped with bits of crispy house cured bacon, tomatoes, chopped scallions, chunks of blue cheese, blue cheese dressing, and fried chicken livers.  Never one to eat processed snack foods this was a rare experience for me with potato chips (or popcorn) and although the others ate more than myself, I loved the way the crisp chips held up to the ample toppings and despite the sheer gluttons of the dish the flavor profile was nicely balanced, albeit quite heavy.\u000a\u000a"Grichebactom."  Described as the "workman's" grilled cheese I'm not so sure many "workmen" find this in their lunchbox, but the combination of grilled sourdough, creamy brie cheese, double smoked bacon, and fresh tomatoes with a side of skinny fries was certainly delicious.  Using the fries largely as a delivery mechanism for Chef English's signature ketchup and BBQ sauce the chunky ketchup was outstanding, loaded with smoke and garlic while the BBQ was a tad sweeter than I'd prefer.  \u000a\u000aBLT Sliders with Nueskes bacon, roma tomato, maple aioli, and skinny fries. Served as three buttery rolls loaded with supple bacon, sweet tomatoes, and crisp lettuce the aioli was actually quite mild and more hickory than maple.  Another large portion considering the price and ingredients a whole sandwich ended up packed to go home along with most of the fries.\u000a\u000aDuck buns - a rather Asian inspired dish placing confit leg in an aromatic and sweet hoisin sauce on steamed buns, my first bite was good - the confit excellent.  Next adding the cucumber slaw and cool yogurt sauce, this is where the buns truly shined - as good as any steamed bun I've had, whether Dim Sum or David Chang.\u000a\u000aLobster Poppie with yorkshire pudding, creamy corn, and brown butter lobster.  Essentially a pot pie with a significant portion of buttery fresh lobster baked atop flaky pastry and dressed In chipotle sauce and house made sweet cream corn the flavors were excellent, though the chipotle was a tad overwhelming in bites where too much had soaked into the pastry.  Listed as a sharable appetizer I'm not sure how well this would divide as it was rather small, but as a main course it would satisfy most.\u000a\u000aMona's bread pudding with English toffee sauce, salted caramel ice cream, cap'n crunch.  A large brick of lovely custardized bread with a bruleed top, the bread pudding itself was loaded with cinnamon, sugar, and rum.  Resting in a boozy toffee sauce that tasted largely butterscotch and topped with whipped cream and salty caramel ice cream the dish was finished with a playful handful of children's cereal.  Intensely sweet but subtle in the way all the ingredients contributed to the overall flavor the dish was simple and wonderful\u000a\u000a"Ninja Snacks," a plate of eight crispy wontons filled with nutella and banana served with "ninja sauce" that tasted quite similar to my English toffee.  Naming issues aside, the wontons themselves were excellent and absolutely stuffed with filling.  Using sliced banana instead of a puree lent texture beyond the crispy wrappers and while the sauce wasn't necessary it certainly didn't hurt.\u000a\u000a"The Elvis," a dish described as pound cake, peanut butter, brûléed bananas, maple bacon and served with a shirley temple.  Delivered as two "sandwiches" utilizing pound cake as the bread it really isn't that the dish was poorly designed as it was that the cake was simply too dry.  Tasty otherwise, especially the bacon/maple/banana/peanut butter combination, the Shirley Temple was very sweet and obviously added more for kitsch than flavor.  The chocolate covered peanut was also quite tasty.\u000a\u000aChocolate Rendezvous, would essentially represent a chocolate crème brulee topped with peanut butter mousse, topped with marshmallow, and then finished in the oven.  A parfait of sorts with different textures as the spoon proceeded downward the dish was actually too large for something so rich...like the bread pudding and ninja snacks it was a dessert that could have easily been shared, and so it was.\u000a\u000aIn a city where the rich and the poor are quite well represented (The amenities, the shopping, the restaurants, and the patrons) it is nice to see there are some places still targeting the "middle" and doing a good job with a "something for everyone" approach.  Above average food made from above average ingredients in a nice space at below average prices should keep Mr. English's P.U.B in business for quite some time, especially if a whole meal can be had at the price of a pair of socks at the shopping center next door.

VLocated on Scottsdale road just past 1st and featuring a 2-story dining patio plus an industrial chic interior I arrived at RnR just after 8:30 and finding ample parking I made my way in to a sign suggesting I could seat myself - a reasonable proposition that left me any number of 4-6 tops with a great view of the HD-Flatscreens as only one other (very hung-over) party was present - and moments later I was greeted by a young man named Fredrich who would act as my server - and a good one at that considering my substantial capacity for caffeine and nearly two hour stay.\u000a\u000aHaving already researched the menu online and with $30 to spend per my gift card I spent a few minutes perusing the menu and with the game now tuned in (by request) my order was placed I was left to wait - half studying/half watching the game and fully aware that the restaurant was soon to get quite full and quite loud but perhaps slightly less knowing of just how much food I'd ordered as I sipped a bold and smoky brew simply described as "Italian Roast" and fitting that description quite admirably with an ever so slightly 'over-roasted' top note that begged for something sweet - and here, sweetness would come in spades.\u000a\u000aNow bearing in mind that Fredrich was the only server I interacted with during the course of my meal I will say here that he could have warned me of what was to come but in all reality I'm kind of glad he didn't because it would have ruined the surprise of the first dish to arrive - a cinnamon roll the size of a hubcap finished off with a gigantic sparkler that simultaneously made me the child in me think awesome while the adult just laughed at the gluttony realizing that there were 4 more dishes to come...and that the whole room was staring at me.  Presentation aside, the cinnamon roll itself was additionally quite excellent; the outside ring suffering from a bit of dryness due to the substantial size but the interior warm, flaky, and easily imbued with a whole stick of butter, a half cup of icing, and multiple tablespoons of cinnamon.  For those wondering, I ate all but the outer ring - and yeah, I could've probably eaten that as well, but the Quails on Main Street looked hungry and I had four more places to eat on the day's agenda.\u000a\u000aMoving on to my other options, proving the adage that bigger is not always better the Chambord French Toast would prove to be an excellent dish well worthy of its "signature" status with a thick slice of egg bread - think challah without braids or brioche but lighter - split and stuffed with Chambord infused cream cheese and topped with raspberries, Gran Marnier, and light crème Chantilly.  Still a large dish, but far less so than the cinnamon roll the French Toast was a practice in subtleties as each constituent was present, pleasant, and balanced without overwhelming the others...and proving my little sister's theory correct once again, a bit of maple syrup certainly didn't hurt.\u000a\u000aFor the last item I'd eat during my stay, a single vanilla bean pancake with apple butter would prove to be sole lowlight of the morning as the cake itself was dense rather than fluffy and largely lacking in vanilla flavor, though the apple butter and seasonal berries were quite nice.\u000a\u000aNoting here that I would have been more than contented to leave RnR with a favorable impression at this point, with a $30 certificate to spend and the Buckeyes to watch I stuck around sipping coffee for quite some time while picking at the cinnamon roll and once The Ohio State University had assured a win I picked up two items to go - a chocolate chip muffin and maple bacon scone - both baked in house, served warm, and very nicely done with the scone soft and subtle while the muffin was slightly toothsome and studded with dark chocolate...they went great with a cup of coffee later on at Cartel and solidified RnR as a place I'd definitely return for brunch or perhaps dessert to check out the carrot cake (and maybe a second go at the Cinnamon Roll.)

VItems selected:\u000a\u000aCoffee\u000aBread Pudding with Ice Cream, Caramel, Walnuts, Raisins\u000aShort Stack Pancakes\u000aShort Stack French Toast\u000aGlazed Donut Hot at 7am\u000aAlmond Bear Claw Hot at 7am\u000a\u000aA veritable Los Angeles institution that I'd always neglected given their ever-evolving dining landscape I was admittedly excited when I found out that DuPar's famous pancakes could be found in Las Vegas at the Golden Gate Casino, but it was not until I found out that they were available 24/7 and that some inebriated friends from out of town were there post-clubbing just as I was finishing my morning run that I committed to a 5:15am Saturday visit.  Located right in the heart of downtown where the last of the nighttime crowd was returning to their homes/hotels free street parking was an easy score and with myself the only person in the restaurant who'd actually been asleep the night prior it was mere moments before we were seated, coffee poured, and orders taken - a plethora of carbs from which my friends would merely pick at prior to retiring for the night thus leaving me with enviable task of playing cleanup to some truly textbook diner food, decadent desserts, and even a pair of fresh baked goods as I hung around abusing the free Wi-Fi and copious coffee refills until 7:00am.  Without a doubt the sort of place where quality and quantity both matter it really came as no surprise that both the restaurant's French Toast and signature pancakes, even as 'short stacks,' were immense but outstanding - the pancakes particularly light and quite literally 'melt-in-the-mouth,' but perhaps more impressive were the pastries and bread pudding - the donut a lightly raised and amply yeasted version without a bit of grease, the "bear claw" reminiscent of the Hungarian Nut Horns at Christmas during my youth but warmer and 10x the size, and the bread pudding a dense, steaming hot wedge covered in caramel and ice cream that rivals the best I've found in Sin City - especially at 5am.

VFull review blogged:\u000a\u000aCrocchette Pugliesi:  With my dining partner interested primarily in the pizza I was left to decide on opening courses and although the focaccia and arancini sounded tempting it was this pair of fluffy nuggets that won me over; and thankfully they did not disappoint.  Featuring lightly whipped potatoes at outside edge with a lightly crisp coating each of these delectable bites burst with flavor as the interior housed a dense composition of house made Fior di Latte and Prosciutto Cotto.  Served alongside stewed San Marzano tomatoes and a light salad of grape tomatoes and spinach each bite was fresh and balanced - my only complaint being that there wasn't a half-dozen more.\u000a\u000aGnocchi alla sorrentia:  Quite simply, good gnocchi is what every starch should aspire to be in my world and these gnocchi were sublime - each small dumpling so light that it threatened to float off the plate.  A dish so often over/under-done each of these fluffy balls was simply adorned with simple stewed tomatoes, torn basil, creamy Fior di Latte, and a light dusting of Parmigiano Reggiano before a quick trip to the oven produced a lightly caramelized crust.  If you go, this is a must order - and if I go back I'd love to see if they'd be willing to supplement the Bufala in place of the Fior di Latte.\u000a\u000aBufala DOP:  Less the gourmand than myself but still knowledgeable of food it was suggested by my dining partner that he was going to order the Regina Margherita but more than happy for my suggestions an upsell to the Bufala DOP took little coaxing and while I cannot vouch to the quality of the Regina I can say without a doubt that the $3 fee was worth every penny as the weekly imported Mozzarella di Bufala Campana DOP Napoli's tangy funk and ethereal mouthfeel was notable in every bite.  Moving next to the crust (offered cut or un-cut by the kitchen in order to stick with tradition,) slow kneaded and just crisp enough on the edges to keep the rim steady and the center wet I particularly enjoyed the low smoky notes and although a bit more blister would have been ideal the simple garnish of unsweetened San Marzanos, Basil, and a touch of Parmigiano Reggiano was precisely what I'd hoped for walking in the door.\u000a\u000aTirolese:  With my colleague ordering the pizza I'd have selected I decided to be a bit more progressive and turned to an equally well constructed pie featuring the same base but subsequently topped with Fior di Latte, Brie, and Speck Alto Adige IGP - a unique imported leg ham first salted and air-dried and then smoked, the flavor harkening notes of sweet, savory, and smoky all at once and perfectly balanced to the acid of the tomatoes by the creamy pairing of cheeses.  Most times a pizza purist when visiting a Neapolitan spot I have to say I may have enjoyed this one even more than the Bufala, though perhaps that simply speaks to the quality of the translucent layer of pork on top.\u000a\u000aSemifreddo Alla Mandorle:  No stranger to semifreddo but having never seen it delivered quite like this what arrived to my table was exquisite - a sort of 'ice cream sandwich' but without the ice cream or sandwich.  Featuring a delicate frozen mousse - think whipped cream but frozen - stuffed with chopped figs cooked in honey and rolled in crushed Amaretto Cookie this dessert was the very definition of light and refreshing, a fact furthered by a light drizzle of reduced strawberry and honey plus powdered sugar that made it sweet, but not overly so.\u000a\u000aMillefoglie:  Described by some as an Italian Mille Feuille and by others as the hand-held equivalent of a Napoleon this Millefoglie was quite different from the versions I'd experienced in Boston and Philadelphia, but with buttery puff pastry layers juxtaposing layers of pastry cream as well as cream Chantilly plus ample notes of honey and Amarena cherry it would be hard to say this wasn't the best Millefoglie I've ever had.  Far more dense than the semifreddo or a traditional mille-feuille but far less so than most napoleons I'd be hard pressed to describe a dessert I've had that is similar in flavor, though the overall texture was something like croissant meets baklava.\u000a\u000aThe Verdict:  While some may contest that VPN certification is meaningless and I would tend to agree, if that is what it takes for 'Pomo to get people past the sub-par exterior and into the restaurant then I am all for it.  While perhaps not the best pizza in the Phoenix metropolitan area due to a little place called Bianco the pies at 'Pomo stand up to the best in all but a handful of cities and when you take into account the strength of the rest of the menu I think it likely ranks amongst the ten best Neapolitan joints I've been lucky enough to visit.

VItems Selected:\u000aSix Cinnamon Sugar Donuts\u000aMonte Cristo - Raspberry White Chocolate Brioche, Battered and Fried, Ham, Turkey, Swiss\u000aBiscuit with Honey\u000aBrownie\u000a\u000aBilled as a "1960's Diner" but far kitschier than that simple designation in both concept and execution, Rambo's Kitchen is a place I'd been meaning to visit for a while but given its location one that required an added impetus, something found in a Saturday errand after a much earlier meal on the strip with friends.  Open at 8am and myself the first to arrive just as the doors were unlocked it was to a bright room of psychedelic colors and paraphernalia that I was welcomed by a young woman named Misty and invited to sit anywhere I opted for a two-top with mismatched chairs at the room's center - the open kitchen to my left, a window to my right, Jimi Hendrix IN the table plus a deck of 'Go-Fish' and an enormous menu on it - the latter quickly navigated to the tune of an appetizer and a main plus a side with each scratch-made item prepped to order as I sat listening to The Beatles. Monkeys, and Dylan.  Beginning first with a half-dozen hot donuts dredged in cinnamon sugar for a mere two dollars as I watched the staff of one seat and serve four more tables (whilst also brewing two pots of coffee) it was after perhaps twenty-five minutes that the object prompting my visit arrived and as if to say "good things come to those who wait" the golden crisp Monte Cristo was a beauty; light cocoa tones and house-made strawberry preserves taking thinly sliced ham, turkey, and particularly sharp Swiss to a whole new level with each crunchy/creamy bite.  Setting aside a thin and boring biscuit improved somewhat by honey, my request with the sandwich in place of four styles of potatoes, and moving right on to dessert it was admittedly a great showing of restraint that prevented me from ordering the "PB+B for two" but with lemon cake and "awesome" brownies as the alternatives my choice became simple - the nearly 1/3 pound chocolate-on-chocolate wedge so moist it seemed only semi-solid and so rich that even half the $3 serving would suffice many brownie lovers...so long as the other half is enjoyed with an iced double espresso a few hours later.

Certainly not one to fault a restaurant based on its clientele despite being subjected to a lengthy delay (and a lack of bread pudding which had sold out the night prior) it should be noted that service was mostly spot on with water and coffee refilled repeatedly as we waited and with a gift of plantain chips as an apology for the wait the meal progressed nicely from there, a half-dozen selections both sweet and savory serving notice to Chef Beni Velazquez's unique talents.  With selections ranging from straight forward fried chicken to impressive savory plantain sandwiches and a truly inspired presentation of crabcakes atop fried, smashed plantains topped with a runny quail egg highlighting the savories it would be difficult to decide which item to order if limited to one but moving on to sweets that decision became far less difficult because as good as the crispy donuts with spicy cinnamon chocolate and supple plantain pancakes were neither could hold a candle to the stack of buttery brioche soaked in custard and cooked till crystalized, a light citrus syrup and fresh blueberries gilding the lily and representing one of the best French Toast preparations in a city...and a strong impetus to return sometime for the bread pudding.

Large and airy with light spilling into the room to match the bright attitudes of the service team I was seated almost immediately on arriving at a table in back per my request and after perusing the menu decided to do what I often do with a menu so tempting; over order.  Coffee in hand and copious refills to follow my meal started off with a pair of pastries including a tender sticky bun and an unfortunately slightly dry scone that livened up slightly with a touch of butter and jam and moving right along my main plates would arrive shortly thereafter, each proving larger than anticipated.  From the smoky chicken atop a crisp yet pliable waffle and onward to the dense egg-bread topped with fresh berries and bathed in fruit-tinged syrup it would be hard to decide which dish I preferred as both were good but neither were 'best of genre' but unable to resist the signature carrot cake (not gifted to me as many have claimed on their first visit) I must say that this dish truly is special - one of those rare situations where reinterpreting a classic shines a whole new light on the dish and puts something pedestrian on a pedestal, the dense spice cake rife with pineapple and coconut served in three layers separated by light cream and flecked with white chocolate.

VItems Selected:\u000aPecan Bar\u000aBlack and White Cookie\u000aCinnamon Roll\u000a\u000aOwned and operated by the team behind Bagel Café and serving a limited menu of items baked at the flagship plus a number of selections made on the premises of The South Point it was largely by accident that I stumbled upon Del Mar Deli but rarely in the area and with the Sportsbook in plain view I gave way to temptation, a twelve dollar trio proving every bit as impressive as the items up north.  Small in size and a bit drab in decor amidst the smoky locals casino it was to a short line of patrons and a smiling staff that I arrived at the Del Mar counter and watching the bakers work for a few minutes in order to determine what was fresh my order wrote itself - two items warm from the rack while the last was cut from a pan, wrapped, and saved for later...at least in theory.  New York Jewish in concept but apparently insufficiently kosher in its offerings as I overheard a young rabbi and his wife discussing their sandwiches it was with a springy hot cinnamon roll beneath rapidly melting icing that my tasting began and moving next to a saucer-sized black and white with modestly sweet frosting atop a delicate crumb my taste buds swooned, the half shared with my mother and aunt equally well received along with a dense pecan bar dipped in chocolate shell atop a butter crust that barely made it past the slot machines en route to the car.

Small in size and kitsch in décor with heavy woods accented by posters, graffiti, and Christmas lights as American pop played overhead it was less than sixty-seconds after the final member of our party arrived that orders were requested and having twice deferred only to be given the first of two strainers of warm bread a somewhat rushed order was placed with a request for items to be appropriately paced - a concept that, along with beverage refills, proved as foreign as the food with the table soon overburdened and serviceware for sharing few and far between.  Opting for specials and staples from diverse regions including Spain, Greece, and nations of the former Soviet Union it was with oddly 'truffled' store-bought potato chips mixed with dry chorizo that our tasting began and rolling next into the duo of oily Chebureki and overcooked dates propped up by an outstanding sherry reduction it was with good fortune that the meal would soon improve, the tender whole squid restuffed with their tentacles and cooked in ink subtly sweet over aromatic rice.  Left precious seconds to digest and discuss a second wave of food soon smothered the table once more and finding far more success than round one both of the breads proved superlative with big flavor and a pleasant degree of grassy funk that I only wish had been present in the tender but flavorless lamb, a 'special' by title only and completely forgotten compared to the bombastic mélange of meat, cheese, and vegetal aromatics contained in the clay pot.  At this point sated but happy to finish with something sweet, two-parts each of baklava and biscuit cake rounded out the afternoon with the former benefitted not by lemon nor liberally applied simple syrup while the latter proved exquisite; a delicate balance of crunch and cream with mild sweetness harkening tiramisu but dressed up with honey and nuts that were perhaps stolen from the baklava and used here to better effect.

VWithin walking (or jogging) distance of the house this has become my 'go to' for weekend runs and although somewhat smaller than other parks in the area it is never been crowded; a big plus considering the sometimes narrow paths and bikers.  Featuring great views of the mountains and a number of large fields for various sports I've not been here late enough in the day to see much of the later, though I have seen a few folks out simply playing catch as early as 8:00am.

Featuring a large, open floor plan with both patio seating and a loft filled with books, lounge chairs, and a communal table plus an impressive selection of scratch pastries and house-roasted coffees predominantly hailing from Central and South America ordering decisions were placed squarely in my hands, the subsequent 90 minutes covering a good variety of cakes, cookies, scones, muffins, and Viennoiserie plus the shop's oft raved Nutella latte which is every bit as good as the rumors.  Speaking to the quality of the pastry much of what we tasted at Sambalatte was well made save for an almond croissant literally oozing with frangipane and a caramel macaron that had clearly been refrigerated, but taking into account the price none were truly 'rave worthy' save for the blueberry riddled scone and complex Craquant de Cuba which managed a delicate balance of decadent and dainty; each layer presenting something new and the sum far greater than sum of its parts.

VQuick, convenient, and well stocked.  Sure it is a little more expensive than Walmart, but with lanes that are actually open and customer service persons who actually perform customer service there are certain times when I'd gladly pay 10 cents more for the same item - Wednesday morning when I ran out of Orbit Sweetmint being one of those times.

VItems Selected:\u000aWee Chicken Finger Pizza - Blue cheese, chicken fingers, and mozzarella cheese\u000aWee Back Home Pie - Thick tomato sauce mixed with mozzarella cheese and oregano, topped with pepperoni, sausage and Parmesan cheese with a garlic crust\u000aPizza Logs - Hand rolled egg roll wrappers stuffed with pepperoni, mozzarella and red sauce\u000aCannoli - Filled to order, two large pastry tubes with espresso mascarpone, whipped cream, chocolate chips, chocolate drizzle\u000a\u000aUsing the term 'divey' as gently as one can it would be hard to describe Moondoggies on Arville in any other way, the space itself a brick box housing old televisions, two lifetime allotments of cigarette stains, a straight-out-of-the-80s soundtrack, and the sort of patrons already drunk enough to dance and sing by noon on a Monday - plus Chris Palmeri's scratch made Naked City Pizza.  Considered by locals and even Food Network celebrities to be a local gem and decked out with Buffalo sports décor telling the Chef's roots it was to self seating and questionably hung over service that my family entered the makeshift dining room and presented with menus plus recommendations our order took form, a surprisingly 'artisan' quartet of items soon to roll out of the kitchen with plenty of grease but smooth pacing and just enough polish to make it work.  Starting out with smile-inducing "Pizza Logs," essentially an eggroll impregnated by a calzone, before testing out a pair of pies it was to the tunes of Tainted Love that the spicy chicken finger iteration arrived and teaming with blue cheese plus white sauce over a crispy semolina-spiked crust I immediately swooned, a 'specialty' pizza justifying its novelty while far outperforming the subsequent "Back Home Pie" which tasted good but suffered texturally under too many meaty toppings and red sauce muddled by cheese and grease.  At this point duly impressed with later plans for dessert it was just as we were about to settle the tab that our server suggested the cannoli and describing them as 'filled to order' I couldn't resist - a duo of crispy tubes stuffed with espresso-mascarpone proving twice as good as those at Carlo's Bakery at nearly half the price as Duran Duran played on.

VNot sure I like the layout of this Wildflower as much as the one on Pima or Indian School, but the same quality coffees, sodas, and goods as well as glass sculptures and free Wi-Fi are all present and accounted for.  The double-sided center island simply creates for too much "carry-over" noise, particularly when children are present.

Featuring a pair of televised football games but lacking jazz, patrons, and appropriate descriptions on the menu the meal began with a single cup of acrid and luke warm coffee before I requested a fresh brew that finally arrived over forty minutes later and moving on to food choices the most consistent fact spanning the items selected was simply that of blatant misrepresentation; the Monte Cristo with 'fresh fruit' delivered with a Heinz Grape Jelly packet and the "Vermont Maple Syrup" also Heinz - a corn syrup bastadization of maple syrup fresh from Pittsburgh.  With overcooked eggs and flavorless ham dominating earlier selections while the chicken and waffles was laughable at best it was only the two sticky buns slathered in 'syrup' and the surprisingly soft and delicate lemon pancakes that prevented the meal from total disaster, but even at $20 the whole experience was not one I'd recommend to anyone, ever, especially with Novecento next door.

VMoving next to things much more familiar to four wheeled dining, the classic hot dog cart took on a whole new look thanks to Brad and Kat at Short Leash Hot Dogs.  Generally not a fan of the American standard beef on a bun with condiments but far more interested in artisanal sausages and the like it was the all-natural Bratwurst from Schreiner's Fine Sausages that first turned my head, but it was the condiments that sold me hook, line and sinker.\u000a\u000aWith each variation of dog named after a pooch of their own, or one of a friend, as I was told by one of the workers while I waited the cart serves up approximately half a dozen signatures plus daily specials, and a build your own option all atop pillowy flatbread (think pita, but with a more open and airy crumb) and although many sounded good none sounded on par with the "Bear" - a dish called 'stupid good' by a trusted palate and on first seeing, then tasting the concoction a very fair assessment.\u000a\u000aDescribed on the menu as "Peanut Butter, Cracker Jacks, smoked Gouda, Bacon and BBQ Sauce" and in my case tinged with a bit of spice from the all-pork Brat this $6 concoction literally hits every part of the palate like a sweet, salty, crunchy, fatty, creamy, and spicy sledgehammer.  Whimsical and fun but decidedly not an everyday indulgence it's the sort of dish that could assuredly fail under many circumstances and fall under the absurdities or Man vs. Food category, but instead it just works beautifully - a dish that would not be out of place at any number of haute hotdog purveyors in other major cities and more than enough reason to give Short Leash another taste at a later date.

Featuring a style described as "Thai Tapas" alongside traditional curries and noodles with each dish made by Nittaya herself and served by friendly Taiwanese servers in a modern yet elegant space a meal at Nittaya's Secret Kitchen is a relaxed and refined affair beginning with complimentary flavored water and although the menu featured no less than a dozen items I'd have liked to try, the decision was made to start with a variety of tapas, appetizer, and curry plus dessert - each item prepared to order, ample in portion, and served with impeccable pacing.  Intentionally incorporating fish, vegetable, and meat before progressing to dessert and focusing on the more innovative options both the crispy fish cakes and the tender duck breast would prove delicious and well prepared with light sweetness acting to temper the heat and moving on to the "famous" salad I really have no idea how the chef manages to produce a batter so light and a flavor so vegetal but whatever the method it should be embraced, the dish one of the best things I've eaten at a Thai restaurant and without a doubt the most innovative 'salad' I've had in years.  Moving on to the dessert menu there was never really a question as to what I would order and with tender pineapple pudding rife with coconut milk custard topped off with both ice cream and caramel of the same I really cannot think of a better 'Thai' dessert, traditional or not, nor a better thing ever done with a coconut.

VAfter a good morning of dining around downtown Phoenix and a few hours of shopping for essentials, clearing out the old condo, and studying I returned to Scottsdale for part two of my food day but (as usual) my plans to check out Barratin and/or FnB were foiled by menus that simply failed to wow.  Having heard countless times that I don't know what I'm missing in passing up these places I guess I'm simply afraid that a menu without something that really catches my attention could prevent me from ever going back and as such I searched for a plan B for dinner-before-dinner and instead ended up with dessert before dinner-before-dinner at Lee's Cream Liqueur where I would not only meet Lee herself, but also have some rather excellent ice cream.\u000a\u000aApparently more of a side job/pet business than full-time gig for Lee, the "Cream Liqueur" concept admittedly seemed a bit strange to me at first, but with Lee explaining her ideas and time spent formulating the recipes I decided a taste or two wouldn't hurt and with stomach capacity plus $5 to spare a few bites of Pumpkin Pie Brandy, Cinnamon Bun Brandy, and Caramel Pecan Tequila would all prove interesting enough (and the latter two quite delicious) to justify a full order - one scoop of Carrot Cake Irish Whiskey and one of Red Velvet Scotch.\u000a\u000aNow, having admitted already that I quite liked what I tasted, I will note to purists or mavens that the texture of Lee's Cream is somewhat atypical, an effect of a blending process that that allows the booze to freeze while also using mix-ins like cake and cookies, but if this doesn't bother you then the flavors are great.  Beginning first with the Red Velvet, I loved the chocolate and scotch combination while bits of frosting added needed sweetness to the mix and moving next to the carrot cake - it tasted like a great spice cake, complete with raisins and nuts, mixed with something akin to Bailey's - it was definitely the favorite of those I tried and even if not the most technically proficient ice cream, all in all a nice idea and an interesting change of pace.

Two stories in size and featuring many things chocolate plus a collection of overpriced comfort foods it was just after 10:00am when we sat down at a cozy two top near the base of the stairs and treated to pleasant "everything is good" service typical to such places a five part order was hatched as the restaurant bustled, leaving one to ponder the reasons for any pending change.  With service swift it was only a matter of minutes before selections began to arrive, the first a superlative $8 milkshake thick with caramel and rife with vanilla but topped with copious whipped cream to mask what I'd guess to be an 8oz serving, a trend carried over to each plate that followed as large prices met small portions thankfully bolstered by bold flavors.  Starting sweet and following with savory due to a kitchen miscalculation it should be noted that each of Brenner's pure chocolates are well sourced, smooth, and complex by the bar and as such both white and milk versions only served to improve the Custard French toast and Soft Cookie, the later on par with that of New York's fabled Levain Bakery in terms of taste and texture (though at 2.5x the price) and while I think everyone would have been happier to see the Croquettes first I'd be lying if I didn't say they were my favorite bite of the meal - the paprika and manchego working smoky, savory magic on the lightly fried kernels.

VI've been here less than 5 days and have already seen two movies here - Spideman and Savages.\u000a\u000aGreat seats and quality screens with good sound, plus not as crowded as the majority of trendy theaters in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  Lighting could use a little work and the staff could be a bit more efficient, but these are minor quibbles.\u000a\u000aTicket prices are a veritable bargain, particularly for matinees and with parking readily available plus a location less than 1 mile from my current apartment I'll certainly be back soon.

VSo much better than people would indicate, but decidedly a 'get what you pay for' sort of experience.  Be a responsible adult, do your research, read the policies, and then decide if Spirit is for you - essentially a matter of cost vs. benefit.\u000a\u000aI'm 6'2", 175lbs, and need to pack one pair of shoes (in addition to those on my feet) when I travel and with that said I still managed to sit comfortably, sleep on the plane, and pack only a small backpack for a 3 day trip to Chicago thus saving $220 compared to the next cheapest roundtrip Thanksgiving flight.

V...visit for the pants and fitted dress shirts in the days before and after Christmas.  Generally not a fan of Brooks Brothers as the Price/Quality ratio seems skewed to the left the calculus changes definitively when another 25-50% is taken off the already half-off prices.  Lets face it guys, men's dress pants styles really don't change that much and a white double stitched French cuff dress shirt will be just as classy in 30 years as it is today.

Ostensibly a locals-only place in theme and due to location B.A.R. does not seem like much from the outside and upon entering the surprisingly large space we were met by some surprise as the restaurant was having a rather slow day (something I'm told NFL Sunday is certainly not) but greeted by our server we were quickly led to a high table in the main dining area and with menus in hand a decision process began resulting in two beers and six plates plus a couple more when another friend arrived later.  Creative in theme given the 24/7 nature of the space and featuring items running the gamut from simple sliders to inspired stoner-cuisine two of our items would derive from each of the appetizers, sliders, plus breakfast menus and proceeding sweet to savory every item was executed every bit as good as the new class of celebrity-chef gastropubs on-strip; the monte cristo slider, Mac n' Cheese Bites, and Banana Bread French Toast particularly memorable while the Hendertucky Toast is simply too absurd, fun, and affordable not to order.

VLeaving Las Vegas en route for Los Angeles we'd originally considered traveling pastries from Bouchon versus our leftovers from Robuchon as breakfast - at least until I heard about Babycakes Café.  Highly regarded on Yelp! and reported to be committed to local high quality ingredients the small shop was a brief detour and, honestly, how often do I have a car at my disposal in Las Vegas?  Opening at 7am we woke early, loaded the car, and arrived at the restaurant at 7:05 - so early the coffee hadn't even finished brewing.\u000a\u000aEntering the restaurant we were greeted sleepily by a young Hispanic woman at the front and seated by a young Hispanic man who would also act as our server throughout the meal.  With water poured menus were delivered and once coffee and tea were optioned for we were told it would be a few moments as water was still boiling and coffee still brewing.  Low on décor we sat back and watched highlights of DeSean Jackson lighting up the Giants on the plasma screen until the young man returned with beverages and took our orders.\u000a\u000aWith quality service throughout the meal - coffee refilled frequently and water never empty - we watched the restaurant slowly fill to half capacity while we waited...and from my vantage point I watched the kitchen, a two man operation running the griddles and grills with great speed and skill.  With the time just shy of 7:30 our plates would arrive - each warm, well prepared, and accompanied with appropriate toppings in small plastic cups.\u000a\u000aThe first plate, ordered by my sister, was the short stack of Peanut Butter and "make your own combination!" pancakes - in her case banana and chocolate.  Served with maple syrup the pancakes were decent but not spectacular - a mild peanut butter taste within and chopped bananas and chocolate chips atop.\u000a\u000aMy aunt's selection, a short stack of Red Velvet pancakes topped with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles and served with cream cheese syrup would fare better than my sister's choice, albeit largely only because of the syrup.  Cocoa tinged, thin, and somewhat crisp on the exterior the pancakes themselves were tasty while the addition of the chocolate crumbles lent some textural variation and the whipped cream was expectedly sweet.  In the cup, imagine a mildly citrus cream cheese frosting thinned out - a great idea that worked nicely on both this dish and my selection.  As we'd be dining on Red Velvet pancakes for the next two days I feel obligated to note that these were the worst of the group by a large margin.\u000a\u000aFor my choice, Carrot Cakes - certainly the most interesting of our pancake selections with shredded carrots and pecans studding the batter.  Topped with more crumbled pecans and the same lovely syrup served with the red velvet options I actually enjoyed my short stack quite a bit and was glad I'd opted for less food so I could sample some of my mother's choice - the best of the meal.\u000a\u000aTitled Honey Toast and described as "two pieces of thick sliced honey toast dipped in a farm fresh egg wash and cooked to perfection! Then drizzled with sweet honey. Yummy!" I will have to agree with Babycake's assessment - they were prefect and yummy.  Significant in size and heft the two thick slices of toast were perfectly caramelized on the exterior and custard within while the slowly melting whipped cream and honey proved to be a smooth and sweet balance without being overly saccharine.  While superfluous, I will note the house syrup was actually quite good - it reminded me of the Sweet Syrup at Camellia Grill in New Orleans.\u000a\u000aSettling the modest bill - a mere $7.50/each with tax and tip - at the front before making our way to the car we were bid farewell and told to come back soon.  While I'll admit that in retrospect I rather wish we'd have simply gotten some pastries for the road, I certainly did not dislike Babycakes - it just wasn't worth the special trip.  While the small café would be well suited for a city like Columbus or Toledo, given the quality of the competition in Las Vegas it just doesn't stack up, even if the price is a steal compared to options on the strip - I'd much sooner venture to Hash House a Go Go (on strip or off.)

VLeaving Matt's low on caffeine and realizing Jiffy-Lube and Chase were not yet open to accomplish my afternoon errands I decided to next pay a visit to Jobot Coffee - a place I'd heard both good (music, coffee) and less-than-stellar (patrons, service) things about and pointing my GPS to the address I at first wondered if I'd mistyped; to say the least the area is residential and unassuming, but upon seeing the "Coffee" sign I assumed I was in the right place, parked, and walked in as Sigur Ros Takk played on the outdoor speakers.\u000a\u000aHalf knowing what to expect from a house-come-coffee shop named the "best place to take a scenester" by the local media I entered the doors of JoBot to the aromatics of coffee and a bar populated by the partially hung-over and half-shaven but surprisingly also to smiling faces and families sitting with their Ipads as the kitchen turned out respectable looking sweet and savory crepes.  Not realizing that the space served food in addition to coffee I was greeted by a young lady at the bar who asked if I wanted a menu or if I knew what I'd like I deferred for a moment while I perused the options - eventually settling on an iced Toddy and a pair of pastries made in-house that morning - a $10 tab including a $1 tip.\u000a\u000aWith the space almost intentionally run-down looking and tables, benches, and chairs strewn throughout three rooms I found bench and 2 tables near the back where a defunct piano sat alongside a family of four and after getting out my books took my first sip of the Toddy - a rich blend from Cartel with a bit of stone-fruit up front and deep chocolate notes on the finish before moving on to my pastries - a $2.50 Strawberry "DohNut" and a $4.00 slice of Dr. Pepper Cake.  Beginning first with the donut - a small ring that was possibly baked rather than fried given the total lack of grease, rich cake-like texture, and pockets of berries plus an ample coat of not-too-sweet strawberry glaze I have to say the it was more 'muffin' than donut, but all in all it was still quite good.  Moving next to the cake - dense, fudgy, and just bitter enough between the cocoa and the nuts to balance the saccharine sweetness of the soda it has been a long long time since I ordered something as simple as "chocolate cake" and while there is no doubt I could have made something like this at home it was a really nice reminder of how good 'comfort food' can sometimes be - particularly with really good coffee in a relaxed setting.

VWandering the local shops and checking out parts of Nevada I'd never before had the chance to explore a later stop would take me to "Crepe Shack & Waffles," another Henderson newcomer where I at first considered another waffle but instead went with a crepe - the right choice, I'm rather certain, as the fluffy and light disk was made-to-order by a friendly young woman named Sandra and subsequently rolled into a cone and stuffed chock-a-block full of Banana Nut Ice Cream, Brown Sugar, Cinnamon, Fresh Bananas, Caramel, and a dash of Sea Salt.\u000a\u000aApparently a Japanese trend now gaining popularity on both coasts and featuring a large, spacious, and modern look with friendly servers, myriad options, and great prices ($5 for a crepe cone, $6 for a topped waffle) this is definitely a trend I can support, though in an ideal situation a place doing such a thing with house-made ice creams and condiments would be all the more appealing - and to find that in Vegas I think the best option is a crepe and some ice cream or gelato at Jean-Philippe in the Bellagio at nearly twice the price.

VAnother of the small community parks in Summerlin with decent grassy areas unfortunately sullied by persons unable to clean up after their dogs.  Factor this into the general lack of running space save for the concrete perimeter and their are certainly better locations to run, jog, or spend time in Summerlin.  Nice compared to some cities lacking greenspace but nothing I'd bother revisiting considering the number of higher quality options in the city.

VItems sampled include: \u000a\u000aPistachio, Coffee, and Caramel with Salted Butter Macarons\u000aMille Feuille\u000aCoffee Buche Noel\u000aAlmond Croissant\u000a\u000aIronically serving as a sharp contrast to the experience at Honey Salt a later day stop at Patisserie Manon would present pleasant and competent service despite entirely sub-par French pastry - the seemingly well regarded shop perhaps overrun with holiday orders but unable to impress with a single item; the macarons gummy (albeit quite nicely flavored,) the mille-feuille mushy, and the Buche Noel ornately decorated but tilted far adrift in the frosting to cake ratio making it somewhat akin to spooning frosting from a can directly into your mouth.  Good, although certainly not great, the almond croissant was one saving grace for the lot and I'd gladly return to enjoy one fresh/warm/fluffy at a later date to better assess as the shell was appropriately crisp, the frangipane thin and not overly sweet, and butter tones ample...but at the same time, why travel so far off strip when both Bouchon and Payard are more than capable of delivering a superlative croissant without leaving the hotel?

VItems selected:\u000a\u000aPot of Bread - Cinnamon\u000aChicken and Waffles\u000aPeanut Butter and Jelly French Toast\u000aIlly Coffee with refills\u000a\u000aAlways on the lookout for a great local breakfast spot and already in Henderson for business reasons I decided to make my way over to "Rise & Shine, a Steak & Egg Place" largely based on the fact that anyone willing to go out on a limb and sport the website www.bestbreakfastvegas.com clearly warrants judgment; my verdict suggesting blatant false advertising.  Featuring a kitschy design with floral umbrellas hanging from the ceiling and servers in their pajamas plus a menu of breakfast and lunch classics ranging from classic egg dishes to more novel options such as red velvet pancakes service was spot on despite the early morning rush and with my order placed within moments of seating coffee and water remained filled to the brim at all times.  With good service and fun décor it was my hope that the food at Rise & Shine would indeed shine but perhaps because I didn't order "Steak & Eggs" the selections I tasted were average at best, the sort of place where big portions trump high quality ingredients - the chicken crispy but largely flavorless over a hotel lobby quality waffle and the pot of bread tasting mostly like yeast, something that Log Cabin 'syrup' and butter did not remedy.  Better in quality but still marred by low quality ingredients the French Toast would fare the best of the morning's options but given the location and the cost I can name no less than a dozen restaurants more deserving of the 'best breakfast vegas' title.

Seated on entry and presented with menus, water, and gratuitously refilled fair trade coffee (bring your own artificial sweetener if you don't fancy stevia) from a pleasant and efficient woman named Joanna who was seemingly running the show solo the meal most certainly started out well...at least until the food arrived.\u000a\u000aFeaturing a frequently changing selection of items based on what is fresh and local I have to commend Tryst for offering a multitude of options catering to a variety of dietary restrictions, but on the whole the only item which was tasted that really impressed was the French Toast; a hard to mess up amalgam of rich peanut butter and jam on eggy brioche that was pan seared golden and quite good even though the fruit cup lacked flavor aside from the overwhelming melon.\u000a\u000aMoving past the toast, I guess the tots were as good as you can do with fried potatoes - a light sweetness, though some a bit overcooked - but the flavorless and watery ham on the Monte Cristo and the single ring of too-dull-to-taste Pineapple cooked into the base of a pancake no better than Bisquick left much to be desired.  Unique enough as an option for persons with food allergies or restrictions I certainly see a place for Tryst Café in the local food scene - just not in mine, not considering the overall quality Phoenix's breakfast/brunch scene and organic/healthy/vegan spaces like Herb Box or Nami

Large, loud, and sceney on its own and all the more so with Marquee launching its dayclub across the way it was amongst the sunkissed and scantily clad that we entered Holsteins at the eleven o'clock opening hour and led to a large table with views of both the televised NHL playoffs as well as the crowd our meal began promptly with buttered popcorn and water as effusively friendly and efficient service guided us through the new spring menu.  Not particularly fond of burgers myself but willing to share in the setting of other selections it was with a duo of creamy, boozed-up shakes alongside four underwhelming hushpuppies that tasted neither of shrimp nor spicy pork that our order kicked-off and progressing at a good pace as the dining crowd swelled it was not long before the second wave arrived; the $17 pasta hilariously overpriced given the dearth of lobster and small size but both the belly on bao and burger truly delicious - the later a perfect medium with great balance and texture derived from impeccable accoutrements including the melting avocado.  Never one to skimp on sweets, particularly in belated celebration of my friend's birthday, it was with the new "Un-Birthday" cake that our meal concluded and featuring layers of dense cake juxtaposing smooth frosting in a portion large enough for four suffice it to say that the $15 charge is warranted, a rarity on any Block 16 menu.

VSolid.  Blog review will be posted soon.  Spoke to Chef Meyer for a bit and the space is breathtaking with a great view.  Had the butternut squash bisque, charcuterie plate, Croque Madame, and Profiteroles - $50 w/ tax and tip.  They serve Intelligentsia, the table bread is buttery and smooth, and my primary server was superb while the ancillary staff was competent.  \u000a\u000aLarge cocktail list, bigger dinner menu than lunch, and excellent execution on the plates I tasted - should prove a solid rival for Bouchon (or a place to eat lunch while Bouchon is only available for dinner and breakfast.)\u000a\u000aThree course lunch was $28, Charcuterie $15.

Located in the West Tower with ornate chandeliers, ample glass, and plenty of shine it would be easy to say that Wicked Spoon is the 'nicest' buffet in which I have dined but with expansive size as well as selection - over 150 items offered at $38 for brunch - it would be equally fair to suggest the immaculately clean space also represents one of The Strip's biggest "bangs for the buck" as a team of chefs spread across several open kitchens work diligently replenishing each station with ornate small plates at a speed that would put all but the most seasoned short-order cook to shame.  Expeditious and friendly in service with purified water on the table and good coffee refilled nearly every time a plate was cleared it was with a focus on variety that I explored the various stations of Wicked Spoon and although not every dish was a success I'd say 85% of the sixty-six items I sampled were at least good while a few far exceeded expectations.  Starting sweet then veering savory and subsequently switching back-and-forth as new plates emerged from the kitchen items such as the fresh fruit pastries immediately showed the strength of the pastry department and while chocolate options proved a touch heavy handed the gelato selection was stunning, the 'white chocolate coffee' and pistachio both on par with Art of Flavors in terms of texture and nuance.  Moving past disappointing Italian and Asian fare aside from swoon-inducing sweet polenta, well accompanied congee, and caramelized pork belly as well as duck it was on to more brunch-oriented offerings that I turned and while both the benedict and slab bacon shined the macaroni and chicken were merely decent - clever titles aside.  Largely skipping salads aside from the impressive beets but impressed by fruits, cheese, cereals, and charcuterie it was finally at the three-hour mark that I'd finally filled up and having already once sampled the delightful custard soaked Pullman it was to creativity I turned; two slices of the buttery cinnamon bread buried beneath a mountain of house-whipped Chantilly cream, Maple Syrup, Dates, and Granola far outperforming any 'designer' French Toast you'd pay $15 for elsewhere in the city.  \u000a\u000aUnable to compare Wicked Spoon to other Vegas buffets given my relative inexperience with the genre I can only say I was stunned by not only the quality of the food but the passion behind the project.  In a world of "China Buffets" and Golden Corral's where neither presentation nor preparation seems to matter, let alone freshness or sourcing, Wicked Spoon chooses to function like a proper small-plates restaurant with sparkling cleanliness to compliment a trained Chef's vision.

VConceptually "Chinese Mexican fusion," China Poblano is billed as a blending of the two rich cultures.  Located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan somewhat hidden in the back, the restaurant is certainly eye catching.  With an entryway shaped like Buddha and "Mexican Takeout" windows on either side the campy feel is palpable, but acceptable.  With an interior of communal and separate dining tables, a noodle making station, and wall decorations ranging from Chinese Opera Masks and Lanterns to Luchador Masks and Oaxacan carvings the interior was colorful to say the least.  In addition to the fixed objects there were also large morphing murals - projections of famous and peasant Chinese and Mexican individuals.  To see the restaurant is to love it-or perhaps to hate it-it is certainly over the top.\u000a\u000aArriving in warm soft shells and approximately three bites each the first tastes of taco would come from Langosta.  Described as meaty lobster/mango/arbol chile sauce ($16 for 2 now, $6/e prev) the flavors were good, but unfortunately the lobster was slightly overcooked and I felt the chile sauce overwhelmed the subtleties of the sweet crustacean.\u000a\u000aSilencio tacos - duck tongue/rambutan fruit ($4.5/e.)  Unfamiliar with rambutan until this time I was impressed by the fleshy sweet fruit and its ability to temper the salty, savory, and somewhat chewy tongues.  While not as nuanced as some of the other tacos, these are definitely worth checking out if only to experience the ingredients at a relatively cheap price.\u000a\u000aThe Cochinita tacos, described as Yucatan-style pit barbeque pork/marinated onions ($4/e) were good, but rather expected and unidimensional.   Savory and sweet the pork and onions melded nicely, but in total the flavor was no better or worse than a good pork taco anywhere else.\u000a\u000aCarnitas braised baby pig/pork rinds/spicy salsa verde cruda ($4/e prev.)  With the braised baby pig perfectly done-supple, moist and flavorful-the addition of pork rinds added a lovely degree of crunch and saltiness.  Tempering the other two dishes and adding a bit of spice plus vegetal acidity the salsa was spicy without being overly so-in my opinion they should serve this salsa instead of the chipotle version with the tortilla chips.\u000a\u000aCoctel de Camarones fresh shrimp/jumbo lump crab meat/tomato/avocado ($12.)  Essentially a whole lot of underwhelming salsa in a bowl with a couple of snappy sweet shrimp, thin shreds of crab, and chunks of avocado plus tortillas for dunking it was almost as if someone forgot to add salt, or spice, or vinegar, or really anything other than the listed ingredients which simply were not of all that impressive quality.\u000a\u000aLove Is In the Air heirloom tomatoes/sugar air ($8.88) was much simpler in ingredients and much more complex in flavor.  Nicely presented in a large bowl with what must have been two fresh whole tomatoes and a splash of vinegar the dish was topped with an "mg" manufactured foam full of delicate sweetness that acted only to enhance the natural flavors of the tomatoes beneath.\u000a\u000aLamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You vegetables/crispy lace ($11.88 now, $8.88 at our visit) delivered five pockets of lamb, cabbage, radish, and smoky seasonings inside a crispy lace shell.  While slightly oily, the lamb itself was impressively cooked and not a bit gamey-with the mélange of vegetables elevated by the cumin and black pepper this dish was clever and tasty with obvious contributions from both Hispanic and Chinese cultures.\u000a\u000aOcean Nest scallops/crab/shrimp/pan-fried egg noodles/seasonal vegetables ($10 at our visit and now $22 w/ king crab/lobster) would be a successful yet rather ordinary dish.  With crispy noodles resting in a gentle fish broth at the base and three head-on shrimp, three scallops, and a few chunks of crab interspersed with bok choy, spinach, and onions the flavors all worked and the textures were nicely done-at $10 the dish was a steal, but lobster or not I don't think I'd recommend it at the current price point unless there was a good deal more seafood.\u000a\u000aThe Unruly Monk with hand-cut noodles/bok choy/wild wood ear mushrooms/poached egg ($16) was served in an enormous bowl with perhaps a half liter of broth, boiled bok choy, a single egg, and a plethora of mushrooms the dish would be a nearly mirror experience of the Ocean Nest-a nicely executed dish, but no better than could be made at a local Chinese restaurant in most mid-sized US cities.\u000a\u000aIn the end I think the verdict is still out on China Poblano - I'm not willing to rule it out, but I'm also not ready to say the "concept" (which is exactly what it is) "works."  While certain dishes worked to great effect, others merely represented decent versions of Americanized ethnic food, and some were simply underwhelming.  Looking at the menu only 2 weeks after my visit I already see many changes and given Andres' propensity for exploration I've no doubt the menu will continue to evolve as they find what works and doesn't.

VA full review will eventually be posted in the blog, but for the time being I will simply state that along with Sage these are the two best dining experiences in Vegas today.   Having been to most of the most well regarded restaurants across the country, I can only say that what Gagnaire's kichen produces needs to be "experienced" to truly appreciate it. \u000a\u000aGo with an open mind, order the things you think sound best, sit back and receive the epitome of flawless service.  If Keller/Achatz are the pinnacle of structured fine dining in the United States, Twist may just be the definition of a well calculated mad scientist.

VSecond visit - dishes experienced include:\u000a\u000aHemingway Visits Asia - Dragonfruit Rum, Lime Juice, Grapefruit Juice, Maraschino Liqueur, Grenadine, Simple Syrup\u000a\u000aSmoked Sea Salt Sable / Duck Confit covered in Panko Bread Powder / Flax Cracker with Carrot Chantilly / Squid Ink Tartlet with Trout Roe and Foie Gras Custard / Roquefort Tartlet with Mustard seed and Mascarpone Cream / Tequila Pomegranate Gelee\u000a\u000aFrench Baguette, Walnut Raisin Molasses Bread, Italian Buttermilk Bread, and Bordier Butter\u000a\u000aBlack Truffle - Pumpkin Cake with Salt Cod, Black Truffle, Gold and Red Beets, Spinach Veloute with Garlic\u000a\u000aHudson Valley Foie Gras - Poached Foie Gras with Horseradish Emulsion, Sauerkraut, Morteau Sausage / Glenmorangie Glazed Duck Foie Gras Terrine with Gingerbread Powder, Dates, and Hazelnut / Dundee-Pinky Condiment with Apple Ice Cream and Poquillo Pepper Compote\u000a\u000aFour Story Hill Farm Poularde - Black Truffle Puree, Diced Artichoke, Fennel, Cuttlefish, and Dauphine Potatoes over Savoy Cabbage / Cold leg roulade with Ginger Salad and Lemon cream\u000a\u000aLa Grande Dessert - White Chocolate Glace with Lemon Gel, Lemon Confit, Crème Parfait, and Grappa Syrup / Grapefruit Marmalade with Pineapple and Red Pepper Confit, Pink Champagne Granite / Pear Liquor Cremeux with Anise Poached Pear, Coffee Soaked Biscuit Jaconde, Milk Chocolate / Chestnut Orange Gateaux with Clementine Syrup / Guanaja Chocolat Ganache with Caraibe Chocolate Ice Cream and Salty Caramel Tartlet / Passionfruit Syrup, Marron Glace, Pistache Diplomate\u000a\u000aChocolate Crunch / Cassis Gelee / Nougat / Pistachio covered Cherry\u000a\u000aIf one has never been to a Pierre Gagnaire restaurant, as my friend hadn't, I think it is best to set the expectations appropriately.  First of all, the room will be dramatic and the service will be exemplary.  Second, there will be ingredients you have never heard of presented in manners you never imagined.  Third, there will be a point in the meal where there are at least four plates resting in front of you and you'll have no idea where to start.  Fourth, chances are good that there will be at least one plate that leaves you scratching your head wondering "what were they thinking?"  Last of all - the other ten to fifteen plates will not only be delicious, they'll make you wonder "why didn't anyone think of that before?"\u000a\u000aUnderstanding that Twist is high risk and high reward in a city where a gamble is the very basis of the economy is part of the experience and while the reward may not come in the form of a financial windfall the cost of admission at the restaurant newly helmed by Ryuki Kawasaki comes with myriad rewards in the form of cuisine like no other in Sin City - a foie gras dish exploring both bitter and sweet, then bringing it to a peak with super-sweet ice cream only to follow-up with a firey finish being the most impressive example while a brandade dish marring salt and earth elegantly only to leave a sweet, vegetal note on the palate somewhat akin to pumpkin pie also wowed.  To the other end - the true risk taker of the evening came with dessert as the nearly unpalatably bitter grapefruit, champagne, and pepper cocktail was served front and center completely overwhelming the palate only to be followed by five additional sweets stimulating the rest of the palate and completing the vision.\u000a\u000aCertainly not a restaurant or meal for those happy to dine at a buffet in order to get back to the craps table Twist is a place to sit, think, enjoy the scenery and the service, and embrace the chef's vision - it is like no other place in Vegas, and all-in it remains my favorite restaurant in the city.

Gagnaire frequents each of his properties it was only a matter of time before I returned; the resulting four and a half hours amongst my ten best meals of 2013 and capped off by two dishes that warrant 'all time' best consideration.  Joined by friends somewhat outside my typical 'dining circle' for a truly memorable experience it was with great poise and frequent smiles that the professional staff worked and with expectedly flawless service the food and wine that followed simply 'fit' the room, the mood, and even the conversation - sometimes serious, often whimsical, at times challenging, but always excellent.  Steeped in the stream of consciousness characteristic to Gagnaire but reigned in and refined to razor sharp precision under the eye of Ryuki Kawasaki it was with expected flare that each course was delivered as a collection of plates and with bold, familiar flavors frequently reinvented by subtle nuance the meal unfolded as a slow moving dialogue without the traditional light-to-heavy structure, instead designing each plate as a segue both forward and back with growing complexity defining progress to the final savory before finally breaking pace for a special request I'll likely never forget - a tall, proud soufflé for the ages first imbued and then crowned with the last of the season's white truffles.

With Gagnaire himself present in the kitchen - as well as the dining room, bar, and even lobby - tending to details both small and large it was to an array of innovative canapés plus a quintet of breads with butters from Isigny and Echire that we began and moving next through six courses of meticulous sourcing and style rare would be a lull, a full emersion in the kitchen's stream of consciousness with a leisurely flowing pace. Opting for one tasting and courses a la carte to match 'Spring' began with flavors smacking of the season and although mushrooms both here and later were slightly over-seasoned everything else showed fresh and vibrant, a concept that carried right along to the course that followed - a flood of foie gras comprising seared, salad, torchon, terrine, and even ice cream.  Transitioning to 'surf n' turf' in an eight plate third course of butter poached lobster juxtaposing aggressively peppered beef before progressing to five cheeses novel to even the experienced it was at last in two separate courses that sweets arrived and with Gagnaire himself overseeing the pastry preparation that evening every item arrived with a flourish; a garnish here or an extra plate there to cap another stunning meal.

VA clever idea and much easier to find than many would have you believe, Secret Pizza at The Cosmopolitan is one of those places that seems to get a lot of praise from all the wrong sorts of people yet curious to experience it myself and without dinner plans until 8pm I decided to stop in for a snack while shopping Crystals.  A small place with a TV and a couple of pinball machines plus the slice counter down a long hall of records the restaurant was perhaps half full when I arrived and with three pizzas ready to serve my choice was simplified dramatically when a fresh Roma and Ricotta emerged from the oven as I was waiting in line.  Friendly in service and low in price for a hefty slice with excellent ingredient quality I've heard many compare Secret to New York slice shops and while the foldable structure and gas oven production is similar I'll simply say that anyone making such claims is a fool - most New York Slice shops are serving low quality ingredients on a subpar crust for ninety-nine cents while Secret is serving top quality sauce without unnecessary sweetness under smooth mozzarella on a crust with a good crunch, great chew, and an excellent crumb.  Admittedly bummed that they were completely sold out of canolis that are, alas, pre-filled but still something I'd like to try I've no doubt I'll head back for the square slice sometime soon.

A bustling restaurant, but not a particularly "loud" one despite filling to capacity before we made our exit service was every bit as professional as expected and with drinks readily refilled the kitchen moved efficiently sending out our selections in three courses with excellent timing as the meal kicked off with a bread basket not quite as lovely as the salumi bread at Scarpetta, but warm with a truly impressive Focaccia which I had to mindful to resist after the first slice.\u000a\u000aMoving on to the proper plates, the first course arrived as a half order of thick, toothsome pici topped with a truffle-laden sauce of tomato and duck confit that was expectedly rustic and rich while its counterpart, the oft raved Filone with a poached duck egg sitting atop cheese fondue was equally rich but ever more refined, the silky mix of egg and cheese atop hot bread without a doubt the best dish of a meal full of good choices.  Following the appetizers, a main course of steak with a side of fries was pronounced by my friend to be good, but not $62 good while the $22 Margherita featured top quality ingredients and great char, but failed to reach the highs of the pie at Due Forni which cost substantially less.\u000a\u000aUnwilling/Unable to pass on dessert despite another full meal in just a couple of hours the early evening at D.O.C.G. ended with the house specialty Salted Caramel Budino and yes, without a doubt, this is a signature dessert worth the rave reviews as the dense pudding walks a fine line between too sweet and too salty with bits of toffee acting as a textural contrast; it would have been great with coffee and along with the filone is reason enough to pay D.O.C.G. a visit (even with the exorbitant on-strip markup)

VA third day, a third bakery, but this time the goods actually made it back to the hotel and served as breakfast on the day of my departure...well, okay, I had to try a bite of each while they were fresh but I promise the rest made it through both refrigeration and rewarming without further consumption until the next day.  For my third and last pastry stop on this tour of the Valley I just so happened to be wandering the Scottsdale Fashion Square before lunch at Cowboy Ciao and opted to stop into The Herb Box based on the recommendation of a friend.\u000a\u000aFirst approaching the upstairs restaurant, at this point thriving with Saturday brunchers, the space is admittedly gorgeous looking out on the river and after browsing the menu (note to self, red velvet pancakes and a divine sounding BLT with ricotta) I subsequently made my way down to the basement bakery, café, coffee shop, and wine store.  Greeted on entering by a young lady behind the counter who asked if she could get a beverage ready for me while I waited I agreed to a large iced coffee while I weighed my options; a bevy  of muffins, scones, pastries, and desserts totaling at least forty - some standard and some entirely unique but all but a few desirable.  Deciding once again to choose one for myself and to rely on my server for the second choice my options were boxed, then bagged, and paying the $13 tab with tax and tip I made my way back to the street.\u000a\u000aBeginning first with my selection, a tossup between the Red Velvet Cake and Bread Pudding, the pudding always wins and in this case my selection of Vanilla Bean Bread Pudding with Peach and Peaches n' Cream Glaze would prove to be the best bread pudding of the trip not only in its present cool state, but even more so the following day after reheating.  Dense and packed with notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and most of all vanilla juxtaposing studs of sliced peaches this "pudding" was nearly cakelike in its texture and when topped with the glaze - a dense anglaise with more cinnamon and the fructose sweetness of peaches serving as top notes - it was simply outstanding.\u000a\u000aMoving next to my server's suggestion, another dish billed as "best thing ever," this is one circumstance where I can actually say that at that very moment I felt like she may have been right because as good as my Bread Pudding had been, the adult Ding Dong was all the better.  Beginning first with a dense chocolate cake made with dark Dutch processed cocoa, the base of this dessert was clearly sour cream based and all the better for it as the slight flavors melded perfectly.  Moving next to the "cream filling" in this case replaced with a nearly liquid white chocolate marshmallow cream the sweetness was a perfect balance to the cake while the entirety of the dessert was encased in a dense dark chocolate shell flecked with blue edible glitter.  A masterpiece both visually, texturally, and in terms of flavor I'd not hesitate to call this one of the best "upscale" takes on American Retail comfort food I've ever had (notwithstanding Cathal Armstrong's Foie Gras Twinkie, of course.)\u000a\u000aDoing my best to restrain myself from eating the entirety of both before the following day while carrying the bag from store to store in order to prevent melting in the hot Arizona Sun all I know now is that my next visit to Phoenix/Scottsdale will see me with breakfast or brunch at The Herb Box and desserts from the café below (that may or may not make it out the door, but certainly not to the following day.)

Serving largely as a gastropub, of sorts, and with a menu laden with all sort of upscaled American comfort food it really was not WHAT Citizen Public House is doing that would end up wowing, but rather how well they do it.\u000a\u000aGreeted and seated at a table near the window where our server, Clark, would stop by frequently throughout the evening to make sure we were never for want of anything, menus were present on arrival and with little effort we both honed in on appetizers, mains, and desserts that fit our palates perfectly - honestly, I don't know if I have ever seen a rather short menu put together so many things I like in a trio of plates - and when these plates arrived each were as good as they read.\u000a\u000aMore or less a collection of small plates featuring big flavors the meal began with soft pita and grassy olive oil before moving into spiral pasta thick with cheese and balanced with bright tomatoes alongside crispy chicken over a toothsome waffle that could have easily fit the role of breakfast or dessert as well as an appetizer.  Next up, a plate of tender and rosy duck given texture not by crisp skin but rather crunchy pistachios and millet nearly the texture of mashed potatoes tinged with rosemary and bitter greens.  Not to be outdone, my mother's meatloaf was rich and artistically plated; a classic texture made unique with rich herbal/earthy notes to balance the briny demi-glace and pork.\u000a\u000aHeading to the home stretch and opting to outsource sweets to Tracey Dempsey, a wise move made by many local kitchens, I think I can confidently say that what landed before me was good but what was presented to my mother is a dish she still talks about today - a layer-by-layer temporal change in texture and flavor that was not quite a budino or a pot de crème, nor a parfait - just a decadent sweet-meets-salty amalgam that was truly amongst the ten best desserts I enjoyed in 2012; a reason in and of itself to visit Citizen Public House...amongst many others.

VThis time around I discovered Vosges, Etro, and the Toureneau store.....those alone would make it 5-stars.  Add in the aquarium and everything I mentioned on my previous visit and I can even ignore the repugnant cheesecake factory and give it 5 stars.  I could drop a cool million in this mall and still want more.

Pricey to be sure, part due to the luxury ingredients and part due to the location and exclusivity, this was one of those reservations that required a signed contract and pre-payment and the sort that came with great anticipation...it even came with a golden ticket just to get you in the door...and it was worth it.\u000a\u000aWithout a doubt one of my five best meals in 2012 the eve of Christmas Eve bled into the early hours of the 24th as I sat with one other man from Arizona and a family of six from the Carolinas as Andres and his team sent out twenty three courses of elegant, fun, and mostly delicious cuisine ranging from a meringue of squash that disappeared like a magic trick in the mouth flooding the palate with the intense perfume of truffles to a thick slice buttery foie gras rendered refreshing though the use of citrus juxtaposing dark chocolate.\u000a\u000aPresented by a kitchen of four acting as both chefs and servers while the maître d made his way around the room pouring exotic wines (a $200+ pairing) for my dining partners and unlimited bottled water (a mere $8) for myself service throughout the experience was truly exemplary - each dish with a story and inspiration described at length and timing impeccable.  Surely adding to the meal were the strangers with whom I dined, the wine taking its toll and everyone joyful in the season, and no more so than when the kitchen passed around a porron before dessert - myself missing a few drops at the beginning but performing admirably while some did far better...and some FAR worse...as everyone laughed along.\u000a\u000aHaving enjoyed thinkfoodgroup's food in the past but generally not the service é by Jose Andres turned out to be everything I'd hoped for; a truly memorable meal that warrants both the price and the praise - a rarity in fine dining, particularly in Las Vegas.

VItems Selected:\u000aBear Claw\u000aBee Sting Cake\u000aPretzel Croissant\u000aApple Strudel\u000aAlmond Twist\u000a\u000aOwned and operated by two of the most pleasant ladies I've yet to encounter in Las Vegas one would be hard pressed to name a more 'authentic' ethic destination in the city - Asian, European, Latin American, or otherwise.  Featuring a wide variety of baked goods and imports both sweet and savory straight out of Deutschland at prices representing a veritable bargain compared to many of the area's artisan bakeries it was plain on entry to the small shop that things were bound to be good when I heard staff and patrons communicating nearly exclusively in German and with no less than two dozen offerings available the only difficulties presented by German Bread Bakery was not ordering too much...eventually settling on a mere five selections at a total of $10.89.  Focused on the classics, particularly those most familiar to me growing up to a Hungarian-German heritage, it was with an apple strudel that my tasting began and reheated quickly in the microwave I'd strongly suggest others do the same, the result a light trickle of butter running from the flaky dough as fresh apples and light sweetness found balance in hefty cinnamon notes and delicate pastry.  Moving next to two almond options it was perhaps an effect of my 2pm arrival that the sole remaining bear claw was found to be a bit doughy though the frangipane was well utilized and moving on to the laminated layers of the almond twist I'd wager that no better exists in the city, a light glaze overlying toasted almonds as each shattering bite made a mess of my table and floor, a similar result found in the signature 'pretzel croissant' as buttery salted layers gave way to a soft crumb speckled with seeds and flavors harkening the Bavarian classic but ever more delicate.  Last but certainly not least, my final taste of German Bread Bakery on this day was the classic Bienenstich - a dish rarely found but always astounding when done well and in this case done perfectly with light vanilla pastry cream proving a marvelous balance to rich almond/honey/butter crunch topping all anchored by the yeasty yellow cake - a must order more than worth a trip to both fans and those (unfortunately) not yet familiar.

VItems sampled include:\u000a\u000aNapa Valley Flight\u000a\u000aNeapolitan Margherita with Bufala Mozzarella, San Marzano Tomatos, Fresh Basil, Frantoia Olive Oil\u000a\u000aRoman Duck Confit with Oven Roasted Duck, Bufala Mozzarella, Fresh Spinach, Red Onion, Over Easy Egg\u000a\u000aSemolina Gnocchi with Smoked Nueske's Bacon, Peas, Black Truffle Crema\u000a\u000aSweet Bufala Ricotta - Honey and Roasted Pistachios\u000a\u000aClearly believing two ovens to be better than one Due Forni has been gathering a lot of attention in Las Vegas ever since opening its doors and given the convenient off strip location and lunch hours the pizza and wine bar became our first stop after my friend's plane touched down.  A surprisingly large space with earth tones, wood, and Edison bulbs serving as decoration while two Neapolitano brick ovens dominate the back half of the restaurant turning out both Roman and Neapolitan pies our arrival found the restaurant almost entirely empty and within moments we were seated, a young man named Eric proving a competent if not slightly overzealous server.\u000a\u000aWanting to see what the restaurant had to offer both from the ovens and the kitchen I was given the charge of ordering while my friend enjoyed a $24 flight of hefty reds and with so few patrons at 2:00pm our pizzas arrived quickly, a superlative Margherita with oozing puddles of imported mozzarella and bright, assertive tomato sauce beneath a slick of olive oil and basil followed by a crisp and crackling 500F Roman  style pie with tomatoes replaced by a creamy egg intermingling with rich, smoky duck and strong notes of red onion.  Generally a fan of more blister and bubble on my Neapolitan but thoroughly impressed by the ingredient quality of both pies I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite, though I imagine a Margherita Roman with some Prosciutto would be perfect.\u000a\u000aUnable to resist gnocchi, whether flour or potato, an order of this semolina iteration arrived alongside the duck confit and although rich and plentiful with great texture I personally found the dish to be a touch too saline and a bit heavy on truffle oil - the sort of dish that probably would have benefitted by a glass of something dry and white - and ending on the "RICH" theme I'll simply say that anyplace willing to serve a cup full of sweetened cheese topped with honey and nuts as dessert is worth visiting in my book...smoky, creamy, sweet - definitely a must order, and perfect with coffee.

V...I guess they could just let the vagrants move into this Post Office.  Seriously filthy facilities, many questionable sorts hanging around even at 4:30pm, and rude customer service.  I admittedly don't expect much from the USPS at this point, aside from overpriced and low quality service, but this place is seriously in need of an overhaul and at least a security guard.

Featuring an extensive menu of Japanese classics arranged under headings such as grilled, steamed, and fried plus a handful of daily specials as Chef Komada watched over a team of four in the open kitchen it was with an eye toward variety that we placed our order and with a complimentary cocktail to begin nearly every one of our nine items proved excellent, particularly considering a total bill inclusive of tip less than $30 per person.  Starting first with cold selections and then proceeding through those grilled and hot it was with impeccable skill that traditional options like robatayaki, grilled squid, and chawanmushi shined but far more interesting and thus more impressive were items trending toward esoteric, both the hot and cold mountain potato dishes absolute show stoppers in terms of texture and flavor while tempura selections proved innovative and light.  Moving on to dessert, a decision left in my hands, a selection two sweets arrived and while the tofu mousse was admittedly quite light the general lack of flavor proved rather underwhelming in its own regard and all the more so next to a pair of crispy yet supple matcha spiked waffles topped with a hefty scoop of vanilla ice cream and sidecars of liquid butter and honey, the end effect every bit as delicious as the Honey Toast at Ichiza or Serenade but with a slight bitter undertone adding a touch of intrigue, an upgrade on a classic that seems to typify much of the restaurant's cuisine and all the more reason to come back soon.

VPreviously unaware that Pane Bianco served dessert I'd already made plans for dessert after lunch and given its close proximity plus my sister's mantra that there is always room for ice cream (because it simply "fills in the cracks") I did not let the delectable rice pudding from moments before deter me from driving up the street to Churn.  A small space situated next to apparent brunch favorite "The Windsor" I admittedly drove right past the small shop at first due to the lack of signage but catching my mistake quickly I took a right and then found myself at the complimentary valet who assured me he could either park my car - or that I could take one of the fifteen minute spots in front of Churn, a much more logical option.\u000a\u000aDisembarking from the car and making my way past a family through the doors it was no more than 5 seconds after I entered the door that I was greeted by a friendly woman and with kitsch and candy dominating the space outside the case I was offered a taste of "any and all" that eventually turned into a taste of Vietnamese Coffee, Toasted Coconut, Butter Pecan, Double Chocolate, and Peaches and Honey Ice creams as well as a Peanut Butter Bar.  With the textures very creamy, almost like gelato, and fresh flavors focused on subtlety without being excessively sweet - particularly the peaches and honey as well as the toasted coconut - I will admit that making a decision of two flavors in a cup/cone vs. a cookie sandwich was tough but in the end I just couldn't pass up a fresh baked Snicker Doodle and Chocolate Chip cookie wrapped around Butter Pecan.\u000a\u000aBeginning first with the ice cream, I will admit that overall I probably enjoyed the flavor (and novelty) of the peaches and honey a bit more than the butter pecan, but when taking into account what would work best with the baked goods the subtle toasty notes of the butter pecan won me over along with the texture - like thickened almond butter without chunks or whole pecans at all.  Moving next to the cookies, I would have probably deferred had it not been for the Snickerdoodle but rife with cinnamon and butter I simply couldn't pass up my favorite childhood baked good while the chocolate chip was also good, but certainly not better than those made by my aunt or many other bakeries.  A nice space with great service I'd certainly go back, though in the future I'd go with more stomach space to try one of the designer sundaes...plus a few more cookies served up warm as opposed to cooled by ice cream - perhaps sometime when I check out the brunch next door.

VItems ordered:\u000a\u000aTrader Joes Organic Coffee\u000aChocolate Chip Banana Bread\u000aFrench Toast with Cocoa drizzle, syrup, bananas\u000aChocolate Waffle with Bananas, Chocolate Chips, Syrup\u000aApple Cinnamon Bread Pudding in Cider Sauce\u000a\u000aI am neither vegan nor vegetarian and the concept of tofu made into meat-like-product generally disgusts me, but with that said I do harbor a soft spot for high quality baked goods and breakfasts - vegan, veg, or otherwise - and perhaps as a result of limited ingredients and a need to innovate or perhaps simply because they use a lot of sugar, great produce, and top notch chocolate and maple syrup my experience over the course of much time and many cities has shown me that restaurants eschewing meats (and sometimes even butter and eggs) tend to produce some really excellent sweets; a fact that led me to Pura Vida for breakfast on Christmas Eve 2012.\u000a\u000aSmall, well off the strip, and homey/shabby in a pleasant way that is entirely anti-Vegas Chef Mayra's Pura Vida Bakery and Bystro is billed as "Las Vegas' First & Only 100% Cruelty Free Restaurant!" and with only one server plus Mayra herself running the small space it is certainly not a place to go for a quick bite as wait times for one of the twenty or so seats can top an hour and each dish can take up to an hour to emerge from the kitchen but those with patience (or time to spare) will certainly be rewarded with what I personally consider the best Vegan food I've ever tasted - and perhaps the best breakfast in Las Vegas outside of Bouchon.\u000a\u000aSetting aside the anti-meat propaganda (an interesting way to spend your wait time) and focusing solely on the food and service every aspect of my nearly ninety minutes at Pura Vida was excellent - an appetizer of dense banana bread that was easily 50% banana coming first followed by three dishes emerging from the kitchen as they were prepared; the French Toast a bit less custardy than I generally prefer but light and not overly sweet while the chocolate waffle took an entirely different route by arriving entirely over the top; a crispy chocolate disc topped with dark chocolate, perfect bananas, and resting in a pool of maple syrup - a must order, but perhaps something best shared as it ranks amongst the most decadent breakfast dishes I've ever tasted.\u000a\u000aTruly impressive and not only worth the reservation (or wait time) but also the hassle of getting there from The Strip Pura Vida is a restaurant that stands up for what it believes in and does those things very well.  While Veganism may not be a lifestyle for everyone I'm confident to say that Mayra could satisfy any palate if given the chance while the small staff does everything they can for each guest, even going so far as to plate my bread pudding because she noticed I was taking pictures before boxing it up to go, the dense cinnamon bread soaked through with spicy cider and skin-on apple compote proving a perfect dessert after Lotus of Siam that afternoon.

VI'm almost 100% sure my clerk was just smoking pot outside JUST before I arrived to pick up a package that required signature confirmation last Friday night.  From the lack of eye contact to him TEXTING while on the job and at the counter to audibly joking around with his buddies in back perhaps this is the fault of arriving mere moments before the store closed, but in reality this is an international company that was holding nearly $5,000 worth of my property and countless thousands of other people's possessions.\u000a\u000aOverall clean facilities and thankfully nothing was broken, but not exactly a glowing endorsement for a service I could have just as easily obtained from UPS or the USPS.

A somewhat eclectic place with nuances ranging from classic French to Modern American and even Hispanic dotting an otherwise Italian collection of pastries it was with much indecision that I stood pondering the selections but eventually succumbing to a combination of personal tastes and staff suggestions everything that followed was artisan craft at its best; cakes dense yet supple, frosting sweet but light, macarons a crisp break with natural, smooth filling followed by an ethereal linger, and two items warranting "destination" status; first a Boston Cream Pie superior to the original in texture, cream, as well as cocoa and the second a small cup (available in sizes up to a full celebratory cake) filled with a baba style sponge oversaturated in sweet, milky tones and topped with piped pastry cream plus dark chocolate chips...\u000a\u000a...oh, and on a completely unrelated note, my birthday is in March.

VAs an inhabitant of Summerlin I really want to like Tivoli Village, but in an area with no shortage of shopping both local and nationally branded I just don't see what this place has to offer beyond that which is available all over town - a collection of 'celebrity' chefs whose celebrity pales compared to the strip, a few chain restaurants, and overpriced wine bars not dissimilar to that on the strip.  Pair all this with convoluted parking and yuppies plus their kids and I'd sooner just drive down to the strip for better food, similar prices, more selection, and vastly superior people watching.  Perhaps a visit to Poppy Den or Echo & Rig will change my mind, but I'm not rushing to either anytime soon - once again, better versions of similar things beckon on Las Vegas Boulevard.

A bit of an odd space, dim lighting and dark wood beneath big screen televisions orders are placed at the counter and arriving just as the restaurant opened our order of three thin pancakes was expedited on the open kitchen's three stones with each arriving soft on the interior with the slightest browning adding textbook chew enveloping bold, balanced ingredients.  With prices a bit higher than the majority of creperies Stateside or abroad but service and ingredient quality equally elevated it was with a sweet, a savory, and a special that our morning passed and although my tastes veered toward the complexity of the Avalon it would be hard to argue against the Elvis or the Greek, the former pure decadence with added whipped cream and the later finding balance for the slightly oversalted chicken in the punchy yogurt.

VAfter lunch at Ciao and still with my Herb Box pastries in hand I spent the afternoon wandering Old Town Scottsdale when the sudden urge for caffeine hit me.  Knowing there was a Starbucks nearby but wanting something a bit more novel I pulled up the Yelp locator and noted a familiar name from my research on the city; Cartel Coffee Lab, apparently a new location filling the space of a now defunct store that used to serve their beans.  Having heard good things about their sourcing, roasting, and brewing I made my way into the small store to find a number of folks lounging, surfing the web, and enjoying their coffee and on making my way to the counter I was met by not only a prompt and friendly barista, but also a knowledgeable one who asked what I liked in a coffee (full, thick, cocoa, low acid for those curious) and he spot-on recommended the Ethiopian Dark Roast at $3/8oz or $16.99/lb.\u000a\u000aTaking his suggestion while discussing the other six varieties available I was quoted prices, terroir, and tasting notes as he prepared my single drip and with options ranging from $12.99 for 12oz to $29.99 for 12oz I was told that all were available by the cup if I wanted to taste - a mental note well engrained for my next trip to the area.  With coffee prepared and limited options for sweetener (muscovado sugar or Agave nectar only) I opted to drink it black and sipping the brew the flavor was spot on to what I appreciate - velvety, cocoa tinged, and a bit of cherry and almond.  An important aspect of any city I'm considering as my next home it is good to know that Phoenix/Scottsdale has a place like this - very important.

VHaving already mentioned Cartel, my second visit to the small shop on 5th would be much longer than my first as I spent nearly two hours reading, listening to Who/Hendrix/Stones/Zeppelin/Floyd, and drinking an excellent Toddy of 50/50 Black Market Espresso and Viota.  Having obviously grown their fan base and selections (now including breakfast/lunch/dinner/pastries) since my first visit nearly one year prior when I came out for my job interview/recruitment I still love Cartel and stand by my original assessment that both the shop and the beans compare favorably to spots in New York, Chicago, Seattle, and San Francisco - I'll have to come back some time to check out the pastries and sandwiches.

VUsed for their airport parking specials only I'm not really sure what sort of hotel leaves an unmanned (in this case unwomaned) front desk at 7am, but were it not for the cleaning lady I've no doubt I'd have missed my shuttle to the airport.  Decided to try this place instead of my usual Howard Johnson and although the hotel is certainly nicer the parking situation is seriously lacking.

VBreakfast Review:\u000a\u000aFresh Doughnut Holes Fried to Order with Vanilla, Chocolate, Raspberry Sauce\u000a\u000aFrench Toast Crème Brulee\u000a\u000aIn a city that never sleeps where absentee landlord chefs abound Michel Richard's Central LV stands alone; a 24-Hour restaurant off the lobby of Caesar's Palace where one can theoretically order an item off any part of the menu at any time of day - at least according to the undisclosed person who answers their e-mail - though if you happen to ask for a Mille-Feuille /Napoleon at 6:15am you're certain to get a vacant look from one of the most lackadaisical and slow moving servers in all of Las Vegas followed by assertion that this dish is not on the breakfast menu.\u000a\u000aService, misinformation, and excessive pricing aside I will note that the two dishes I did receive after an inexplicable forty minute wait were actually quite good - the doughnut holes light and hot with each topping delicious, particularly when mixed, while the Crème Brulee French Toast was a textural masterpiece with caramelized bread sandwiching milky custard good enough to justify a ten dollar price tag, but certainly not a $17 one...even if I did save a few bucks in leaving a paltry tip for my server Alexander's total of four visits to the table during my 55 minute stay (menu drop, order, plate drop, check drop.)  Having visited both Richard's fine dining Citronelle and original Central in Washington DC I can only imagine the service at Central LV is Harrah's and not his doing; probably the pricing as well.

Billed as an American Grille and located in upscale Boca Park near Sambalatte and Panera it was just before noon when we arrived at Embers and opting for a seat at the bar instead of the small dining room in order to afford full vantage of the dual plasma screens it would not be long before we were greeted by the friendly bartender and with menus presented plus a round of stiff but well-crafted $8 cocktails soon in hand the meal that followed would unfold in three acts, each piping hot and nicely presented at a veritable bargain even before the discount.  Opting to pair sweet with savory at each course it was with six dates curled in crispy bacon that found  adept balance in funky bleu and light acid that we began and moving on to the smoky yet smooth juxtaposition of bacon and garlic Alfredo atop crisp bread the hits continued to arrive as round two served up at least eight ounces of aromatic, juicy chicken amidst mild curry on one plate and the dish of the afternoon on the other, two slices of custard imbued French Toast with light cocoa notes serving to mellow fresh, boozy fruits as granola added just a touch of sweetness and plenty of crunch.  Battling satiety from prior means yet still debating a third proper course as the first half of the game wound to an end it was with a bit of sadness that we ended up passing on both the pancakes and the fried chicken sliders, but unable to resist dessert it was in the restaurant's bread pudding that we invested our last bites - the warm buttery croissants layered with fresh apples and soaked through with custard before being crowned with a ball of gelato and finished table side with rich crème anglaise, the end result a slowly melting masterpiece on par with some of the city's best and plenty of impetus to head back in the future for the chicken, pancakes, and a second round.

Less successful, the honey bun was simply a case of an item sitting on the counter for too long - the flavor fine but the yeasted dough already getting weighed down by the ample, rich toppings.\u000a\u000aMoving to more savory options, the restaurant's signature Wafflewich would prove to be every bit as delicious as any sandwich crafted of similar high quality ingredients but literally drowned with creamy Bechamel I personally would have preferred the waffles to be a bit more crisp, perhaps even a bit 'crunchy' for texture...but I have to say the rosemary was an inspired touch to what was otherwise a well executed croque madame and although I'm not sure I would call Bread and Butter a 'destination' bakery I'd certainly return if driving up from Phoenix again.

Available 7:00am to 9:30pm I've had them at both ends of the spectrum and honestly prefer them to any frozen "shake" I've had save for, perhaps, the concretes at Shake Shack - the pumpkin was particularly excellent as part of breakfast.\u000a\u000aMoving to the baked goods, as much as I wanted to like the donuts I just could not, save for the baked zucchini version and the dense blueberry fritters.  Perhaps it was the glaze or perhaps the actual batter but something about each of them harkened that 'beany' flavor that turns so many off to soy based vegan foods.  More impressive, perhaps due to the intense sweetness or a different glaze, the cinnamon roll was a much better choice, as was the turnover with a light flakey shell, sweet whipped soy, and fresh blueberry puree.\u000a\u000aMoving on to the rest - I think it is safe to say that anything nami makes with chocolate is a safe bet - the rich organic tablets behind the bar likely 70% cocoa or better and a dominant flavor whether in a tsoynami, drizzled on a pancake, baked into a moist cupcake, or best of all made into dense "snickers" fudge that trumps the original by miles.\u000a\u000aLast, and certainly not least, for those who don't want chocolate - and all the more so for those unfortunate enough to be gluten intolerant (the real sort, not the trendy Hollywood stuff,) get the Yankee Doodle - a nearly quarter pound snicker doodle sandwich with dense, creamy filling, that is better than any snickerdoodle I've had elsewhere - vegan, veg, gluten free, or otherwise.

VElegant and decent selection, but in my opinion a bit overpriced for what you get in terms of furniture.  Would not hesitate to shop here for accessories, accents, artwork, or lighting fixtures but would probably look elsewhere for seating options.

Truly a small space, the max seating capacity only 32 and just one other diner present when we arrived, it seems perplexing to me that so much of our meal could have gone wrong and even taking into account the language barrier when considering a forgotten order of the Uni Tomato Cream there is still no excuse for plates sitting at the pass long enough to grow tepid or for the soggy, flavorless "spring rolls" and oily though admittedly flavorful chicken.  Speaking to the quality of the mains and giving credit where it is due I will note that aside from the tomatoes accompanying the pork being only room temperature both the Tonkatsu and the Carbonara were innovative and well prepared while the desserts, complimentary on account of the forgotten pasta, were both comfortable if not particularly exciting...not exactly a ringing endorsement and certainly not enough to bring me back with so many better options for both food and service steps away.

V".....on one hand, I'll be dressed well.  On the other hand, my bank account will suffer."  These were exactly my thoughts when I realized there was a Ted Baker less than 10 minutes from my new home.\u000a\u000aWhile Burberry and Paul Smith may get all the press amongst British Designers, for my long/thin body type the only clothing I've found that fits better and lasts longer than Ted Baker is Armani and considering the price difference I could buy 2-3 Ted Baker Archive Shirts for the price of one from Armani.  \u000a\u000aWhile I must say I wish Ted's Mens Shoes were a little more comfortable that is a small quibble when everything else fits so well and the sales are frequently so good.  I see a lot of this store in my future.

Treated first with a bag of zeppoles served with raspberry sauce and progressing through two savories and two sweets before moving onto one of the iconic pies the first thing to strike me was how well everything was prepared - the scrambled eggs springy and the poached eggs runny with vegetables nicely prepared and plenty of cheese while both the baked pancake and French Toast were fluffy and sweet with top quality fruit and ample, but not overwhelming amounts of pure maple syrup.  Impossible to decide between the square or the round crust based on quality as both were excellent in Brooklyn our eventual decision was based entirely on the fact that the square pie is only available in a large size and although perhaps not as well seasoned in terms of the bright acidity of the tomatoes or robust herbal notes of the basil the crust at DeMarco's was every bit that of the version at DiFara's, lightly raised and golden with a light crumb and pleasant yeasty notes serving as a backdrop to ample cheese - undoubtedly a contender for the best pizza I've found in Las Vegas.

VFull review in the blog, highlights below: \u000a\u000aChef's Tasting ($45/pp) - 15 different plates, plus tortillas and chips.\u000a\u000aHurache de Hongos - Forest Mushroom, Huitlacoche Sauce, Queso Mixto, Black Truffle, Corn Shoot:  As my friend could not partake in this dish I wish I could say it was unmemorable, but unfortunately it was the best dish in a night of mostly outstanding cuisine.  Beginning first with a pliable soft corn tortilla and then stacking on layer after layer of aromatic mushrooms plus a mixture of cheeses both mild and slightly briny this was a dish that greeted the palate well before the tongue and while the top notes of truffle were certainly notable, it was the intensity of the corn smut sauce that really put the it over the top.\u000a\u000aQueso Fundido - Duck Barbacoa, Poblano Chile Rajas, Queso Mixto:  Transitioning from the salads and small plates portion of the menu to the tacos, the first to arrive was a DIY affair with rich and unctuous pulled duck meat buried beneath a layer of still bubbling cheese.  Slow cooked and tender with spices including (but certainly not limited to) cumin, oregano, cloves, garlic at the forefront plus plenty of heat from the mixed pepper this was an ample serving to say the least but arriving with plenty of fresh tortillas it didn't even last long enough to cool off completely.\u000a\u000aMahi-Mahi - Chipotle Remoulade, Avocado, Red Cabbage, Lime:  Having heard that this was 'the best dish on the menu' by the valet as I parked the car I have to admit I'd probably not have ordered this dish a la carte simply because I've never once had Dolphinfish that wowed me...and that would have been a mistake.  Featuring the mildly flavored fish lightly fried inside a delicate plantain batter the key to this dish was actually the juxtaposition of its accoutrements - the lightly pickled cabbage foiled by the creamy avocado while a light touch of lime brought all the flavors to a point.\u000a\u000aCochinita Pibil - Berkshire Pork Shoulder, Achiote, Pineapple BBQ:  For our 'main course' of the evening a large bowl of smoky pork would arrive with an ample description from Michael and with aromatics abound I only wished I had saved more room.  Reportedly roasted for nearly eight hours wrapped in banana leaves and subsequently braised with achiote seeds, oregano, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, sour orange, and more this was the sort of Mexican cuisine we simply don't have back in the Midwest - incredibly complex, nicely nuanced, and literally melt-in-the-mouth tender...the sort of dish that makes me want to explore the region's cuisine more and more.\u000a\u000aArroz Con Crema - Creamy Poblano Corn Rice:  Think rice pudding but make it intensely savory with plenty of spice - now make it so rich and texturally refined that all but the best risottos would pale in comparison.  At $5 this is the steal of the menu and I'm disappointed even now that I couldn't eat every bite of the cast iron pot. \u000a\u000aEl Fuerte - Flourless Chocolate Cake, Spicy Peanuts, Chocolate Peanut Butter Mousse, Vanilla Bean Flan, XO Caramel, Espresso Ice Cream:  Reportedly a dish for two and although I'd have questioned this statement under normal circumstances it was not only enough for two at the end of such a long meal, but after taking my first bite definitely more than one person should rationally eat.  Essentially three squares loosely stacked and topped with GTC Espresso Ice Cream and candied peanuts dusted with chili before a tableside pour of caramel spiked (liberally) with what I believe was Patron XO Café this was one rich dessert.  Dense on the bottom and light on the top with subtle differences in each bite depending on the various components sampled both Aileen and I worked on this dish slowly and bite after bite it seemed neither of us could stop until I finally threw in the napkin...at least until Aileen left a single bite on the plate and I took the bait, recollected my spoon, and finished it off.\u000a\u000aThe Verdict:  While some may piss n' moan that "Mexican Street Food" should be served on the streets of Mexico using less esoteric ingredients than Berkshire Pigs, Hudson Valley Ducks, and Black Truffles I'll simply beg to differ and continue my belief that any cuisine can benefit from top quality ingredients in the hands of a skilled and passionate kitchen.  Sure some may question the authenticity of Garces' restaurants or the choice location in a fancy hotel but to those of us who value things like impeccable service, comfortable environs, and the 'experience' of fine dining at a veritable bargain basement price I whole heartedly recommend giving Distrito a look - along with Bayless' Michelin starred Topolobampo it is the best Mexican food I've had to date.

VItems Selected:\u000a\u000aAYCE Plate 1 - Brisket, Pulled Pork, Spare Ribs, Corn Nuggets, Hush Puppies\u000aBanana Pudding\u000aCorn Bread\u000aAYCE Plate 2 - Beef Rib, Smoked Chicken, Smoked Meatloaf, Loaded Mashed Potato, Fried Onion Strings\u000aPeach Cobbler with Blue Bell Ice Cream\u000a\u000aHaving recently returned from a Lone Star State tour of smoked meat Meccas ranging from Black's and Snow's to Pecan Lodge and Franklin it was with modest expectations but high hopes that I approached Rollin Smoke, a space many locals and critics have hailed as the best barbeque in Las Vegas, and opting to explore the menu through a generous $24.99 all-you-can eat program I must say I walked away a (very full) believer.  Located on South Highland where outdoor smokers and burning hickory alert the senses to something more than industrial surroundings Rollin Smoke is as small and homey as many a' Texas or Kansas City 'cue spots and staffed by Razorback pitmaster Trey Holland plus a dedicated team of enthusiasts the service is every bit on par with that down south - a true love of the art noted in lengthy answers to questions about woods, temperatures, and process while simultaneously making sure every guest is content.  Featuring a diverse menu with spices and rubs harkening the style of BBQ found across the south but a bit more aggressively sweet than that in Texas it was with a trio of smoked meats, two must-order sides, and buttery cornbread that I began and although brisket was a bit drier than I'd prefer the smoke was prominent and flavor was on point - a trend extending to fatty ribs and supple pulled pork that lacked not for juices, the latter falling just short of KC's Oklahoma Joe's reference standard.  Still nibbling at the creamy corn nuggets as plate two arrived it was here that I sampled Holland's two most raved items and with a blackened caramelized crust overlying tender flesh and melted collagen the beef rib wowed just as much as the signature meatloaf, absolutely rife with hickory notes and light heat amidst a delicately packed beef.  Ignoring decent but mundane chicken and mac n' cheese I found inedibly bland compared to the rich potatoes and previous fried sides it was with a duo of desserts that I rounded out the tasting and suffice it to say that while banana pudding tastes straight from a box the focus should instead be directed to the cobbler, a bubbling bowl of soft peaches with buttery pie crust crowned with Texas' own Blue Bell vanilla - a perfect end to a pretty damned good meal by any standard.

VVisited twice in two days.  While my buddy drank I enjoyed the following:\u000a\u000aFallen Grape - Simi Cab, Fonseca Port, Averna, St. Germain, Served Warm with a Cinnamon Stick\u000a\u000aPotted Farm Egg with Roasted Mushrooms, Ricotta Fondue, Crispy Serrano Ham, Grilled Bread\u000a\u000aFoie Gras with Chestnut Stuffing, Spiced Cranberry Compote, Herb Salad\u000aCoffee\u000a\u000aBread Pudding with Apple Confit, Hoegaarden Ice Cream, Buttered Pecans\u000a\u000aCharcuterie - Pork Rillets and House Pate\u000a\u000a...on Saturday we wanted a place to watch the college games and on Sunday the pro games; sure we could have entered one of the sports books and my buddy could have enjoyed a Miller Light or perhaps even a Molson, but why (aside from saving money) would anyone want to consider that when there is the lavish urban swagger and extensive beer list of Public House at The Venetian?  Coupling the cask ales and copious imports with a kitchen that can actually execute some fairly complex upscale pub-grub plus servers that live up to Las Vegas standards (both in looks and in attention to detail in order to justify on-strip prices and a good tip) and a willingness to turn on any game...even the lowly Tampa Bay Buccaneers and I'd say Public House is definitely a spot worth hanging out, even two days in a row.\u000a\u000aStarting in the lounge on Saturday where a scantily clad young woman named Krystian served up a number of imported lagers and decent knowledge of the province of each to my friend while providing me with the shockingly delicious recommendation of a warm wine-based cocktail to go with an ample slice of creamy duck liver served like Christmas dinner plus a creamy egg fondue that could have doubled as breakfast it really did not take much of an effort for my friend to get me to accompany him back to the pub on day two where we sat for nearly three hours as he ran through what seemed like an unthinkable amount of beers at the recommendation of a young bartender named Toshihir as I enjoyed house made pate and rillets followed by decent coffee, refilled copiously at no extra charge, and a truly inspired bread pudding as light as angel-food cake and paired with creamy apples, crunchy candied pecans, and ice cream that although hoppy on the finish opened up spicy and sweet.\u000a\u000a...dare I say that if all bars were this good I'd probably find myself going out for 'drinks' (ie, food at a drinking establishment) more often.

VGiven the option of being punched in the face and waiting in line at the Post Office I'd probably wait in line at the post office.....but this particular location would make me give it a second thought.  Inconveniently located, slow as hell, and ALWAYS full of people sending 20+ small packages to some random place overseas.

VFull review to be blogged:\u000a\u000aWith service efficient and gracious, one of many servers arrived with my first course - the two for $3 Happy Hour taco pairing of Nopal and Barrio Polo, plus a $4 addition entitled Champinon, huitlacoche, y cotija.  With the Nopal a downgraded version of the egg topped item on the standard menu served only at happy hour and featuring tender cactus with a bit of salt and pepper plus queso fresco atop a four inch corn tortilla I started with it expecting it to be the most mild and as anticipated, it was quite bland.  Moving next to better options, the Barrio polo featured the same warm and tender tortilla topped with chicken, onions, green chilis, and hefty cream sauce plus Oaxaca cheese while the corn smut iteration proved to be by far the most complex and balanced of the trio, the woodsy mushrooms and aromatic shallots heavily perfumed by the huitlacoche.  All in all a good start, but certainly not the best I've tasted and skewed far to the left in terms of cost/quality.\u000a\u000aCurious as to how the pork at BQ stands up to others in the valley I next opted for the carnitas appetizer but was instead served a carnitas taco - cheaper at $3 compared to $9, but not what I'd asked for.  Not really wanting to make a fuss and figuring I could save the stomach capacity this was another decent taco - fatty pork with ample notes of marjoram, thyme, and garlic served with a light accompaniment of onions and cilantro...2 good bites, but nothing to write home about, especially when compared to what arrived with it.\u000a\u000aPresented along with the carnitas, the "El Rey Vasito de Elote" is apparently a signature dish and as much as one may find it hard to see corn as a signature, this is pretty darn good.  Described on the menu as sweet grilled corn in a cup topped with butter, mayo, aged cotija cheese, tapatio salsa, cilantro & lime at a cost of $5 what made the dish really shine was mostly the corn and the cotija - sweet, savory, and smoky at once with just a bit of acid to meld all the flavors.  Served solo and meant to share this dish is also offered over fries, but for my money it was best taken by the spoonful alongside other plates or wrapped in a warm tortilla, free on request.\u000a\u000aFor my final round of savories I went with one of the weekend specials and an order from the 'masa' section of the menu and having expected more small plates I certainly got more than I'd expected from both.  Beginning first with the later, a dish called Tlacoyos arrived with three mashed corn fritters topped with smoky chicken, black beans, salsa verde, oregano, pickled onions, cotija cheese and lightly sweetened cream.  Having expected something more akin to a traditional corn fritter form the $9 plate what I really liked about this open-face interpretation was once again the balance - a composition of flavors and textures akin to the Elote but tilted further to the savory yet finishing with light sweetness imparted by the cream.\u000a\u000aMoving to the biggest dish of the night the tripe and hominy soup entitled 'menudo' arrived in an enormous bowl and at a cost of $5 it was simply outstanding.  Featuring a rich tomato stock rife with offal, bones, tender hominy, and myriad spices plus a quartet of onions, cilantro, lime, and pimento pepper with which I was free to further season as I like this was a portion easily big enough for two but so good that those who love tripe should probably just order one of their own.\u000a\u000aStill with two and a half hours before dinner at this point my server again stopped by and after perusing the dessert menu I decided to end the meal with another duet, one a must order anywhere I see it and the other a must order at any Mexican restaurant but at $6 a piece I should have probably just ordered a margarita, entrée, or another half-gallon of menudo instead.\u000a\u000aBeginning first with the rice pudding - a small bowl of relatively standard white rice with hints of cinnamon and orange subsequently dotted with golden raisins and curls of cinnamon plus, reportedly, "Vanilla Kahlua sauce" it would be hard to find a less flavorful dish containing such ingredients and with the rice cold and clumpy all I could do was wonder if I'd received the previous night's leftovers - a suspicion more or less confirmed when I tried the three milk cake, a dense and dry pound cake parfait made palatable only by the berries and most certainly not by the cream I can only guess came from a ready-whip can.  As a further note, where both dishes were advertised to contain nuts - specifically pecans, none were detected in either.\u000a\u000aNot one to complain except in the setting of egregious service or truly disastrous food I sat for a while with desserts unfinished watching the game still pondering how I'd spent so much on so little that impressed.  Best new restaurant?  Um - sure - for corn and tripe.

VItems Selected:\u000a\u000aCoffee\u000aLemon Ricotta Pancakes - Three Crepe Style Pancakes, Lemons, Cream Cheese Syrup\u000aCookie Butter French Toast - Fresh Whipped Cream, drizzle of Nutella, dusted with pie crust and powdered sugar\u000aKalua Grilled Cheese - Kalua Pork with Melted Muenster and Cheddar Cheese on Grilled Sourdough Bread\u000a\u000aHaving experienced the North Buffalo location with mixed emotions when it was still called Babycakes it was at the recommendation of a few locals that I opted to give the since-rebranded and expanding Babystacks Café a second look and with my mother in tow for an early arrival before the post-church rush I'm happy to say the baby has aged well.  Undoubtedly a place where kitsch finds prominence but where classics and good diner-service also stand strong it was admittedly with much debate that decisions were made on a menu where no less than a dozen sweet selections and numerous interesting savories plus specials reside but with coffee free flowing a plan was eventually hatched - two sweets, one savory, yes bacon, no potatoes, and much sharing after a short wait.  Beginning savory and progressing to sweet I must say things started shaky with a small plate of $4 bacon and surprisingly bland pork lost to buttery bread and cheese but progressing to "dessert" the story turned one-eighty, the thin pancakes fluffy and rich but brought in check by light citrus while the French Toast pulled on no reigns, a full display of decadence with supple egg bread surrounding a slathering of Speculoos and drizzled with Nutella plus a half cup of whipped cream...more than enough to share and impetus for a trip to Centennial Hills to visit Babystacks III soon.

Admittedly a 'standardized' menu featuring solid renditions of the classics but little innovation it would be easy for me to dock points for issues such as tepid duck or small, slightly overcooked shrimp but taking into account the nature of cart service compared to the menu style common to the elite of the SGV or BC nearly every dish we selected was nicely prepared and ample in portion, the total bill for 11 selections ringing in at $45 before tax and tip.  Speaking to specific must orders, particular favorites particularly well done would include both the baked salty egg yolk buns and the even more impressive steamed version of the same, but most of all the golf-ball sized crispy shrimp balls served along semi-sweet Chinese mayo sauce - the rich, supple interior so good a second order for 'dessert' proved mandatory.

VUnassumingly set in the back corner of the Town and Country Mall and demarcated by a sign simply reading "Italian Restaurant" I'll start out by saying that even if Bianco had chosen to put his name on the space it would have been tricky to find, but the fact that it goes under such a generic moniker almost seems to reinforce the fact that the chef isn't trying to rest on his name alone, but instead to focus on the food he holds dear.  With rustic signage and large glass windows looking into the open kitchen there is not a shred of evidence that this is a "celebrity chef" restaurant and, really, if one didn't know any better they could walk right by without paying the space a second thought.\u000a\u000aWith the time just before 2:00pm and lunch hours till 3:00 I walked through the doors to find the interior largely similar to the outdoors and with the kitchen behind a small bar to the right and three other couples seated amidst the ~40 unmatched chairs and old wooden tables to the left the feeling was instantly anything but that of another Arizona shopping center. Working on a small crew of three during the late lunch hours I stood for a moment at the hostess stand before being greeted by the Chef who introduced himself as Rob and suggested I take any seat I like, eventually settling on a cozy two-top beneath one of the ceiling fans as the room was a bit warmer than I'd prefer.  Settled in and with my books in hand it would not be long before I was greeted by Hillary, the sole server for the afternoon, who presented the 13-item menu.\u000a\u000aWith a vibe that speaks to a sleepy Italian villa from the shabby chic seating to paintings straight out of the hands of Italian street artists I spent a few moments perusing the menu before Hillary returned and with iced water in hand and the chef agreeable to my gnocchi request it would not be long before a plate of Pane Bianco Bread with Olive Oil would arrive from the kitchen and after a short conversation with my server about what I was reading I turned my attention to the crusty yeasted roll that, while good on its own, was vastly improved by ample use of the grassy and slightly fruited oil.\u000a\u000aMoving next to my special request, I really did not know what to expect from the preparation as it was simply listed as "Potato Gnocchi with Arizona Sweet Corn and Zoe's Pancetta" but seeing as how I love all three ingredients I figured it would be good no matter what; little did I know that it would be the best gnocchi I've had in my life.  Beginning first with the potato dumplings, each of the little balls was hand cut, light as a cloud, and literally melt in the mouth tender even after a quick sear in the pan but moving past the obvious pasta skills of the restaurant what truly put this dish over the top was the ragu-a sort of half roasted corn kernel/half creamed corn imbued with cream and smoky notes from the pork amalgam absolutely teaming with both sweet and savory notes. So simple, so rustic, and yet so perfect I simply cannot say enough about this dish-the one that finally unseeded Marc Vetri's 2 year stranglehold on the best version of my very favorite pasta.\u000a\u000aAs I swooned over each bite of the gnocchi Hillary kept my water filled and stopped by repeatedly to check in and find out when I was ready for my sandwich and although I was sad to see the gnocchi go I was happy to see the "House-Made Mozzarella with Prosciutto Di Parma" sandwich arrive in the same vivid glory as the one from a month prior at Pane.  Again focused on bucolic simplicity and flawless ingredients it would be hard to find fault in this sandwich or its accompanying fennel and lettuce salad in a light vinaigrette but as good as the Prosciutto was I couldn't help but think I liked the tomato slightly better...though I bet a version with all three would be stunning.\u000a\u000aAt this point quite full and with dinner plans that would turn out to be quite extensive Hillary stopped by and boxing up half of my sandwich asked if I'd like dessert-a suggestion I nearly declined until her smiling description of the Asian Pear Crostata sold me that it was something I should probably just go with - and go with it I did, a bargain basement $5 for superlative poached pear served over a rustic butter pastry and topped with vanilla infused cream. Light, delicate, and much like the pasta and the sandwich a perfect evidence of what one should expect from all of Bianco's restaurants-perfect ingredients largely unmanipulated and prepared just enough to extract maximal flavor.  \u000a\u000aA charming space with lovely service and food that speaks to everything I love about Italian it would be hard for me to find a single bad thing to say about Italian Restaurant and with an offer to stay and study as long as I liked the only thing that kept me from lingering at 4743 N 20th St was the fact that it was a little too warm for such a full stomach-it made me feel like I needed a nap; yet another sign of a very successful meal.  I'll be back, no doubt.

VVisit 2, this time for dinner:\u000a\u000aCrostini with Garlic Goat's milk Butter\u000a\u000aPasta e Fagioli - Native Seed Search Beans, House Made Orchiette\u000a\u000aCheese Plate with candied nuts, fig orange marmalade, Pear- Red Barn Cheddar, Gorgonzola, 'Goat' Cheese\u000a\u000aRoasted Beets with Wild Greens, Warm Goat Cheese, Champagne Vinaigrette, Pistachio\u000a\u000aHouse Bread with Pac Sun Olive Oil\u000a\u000aAZ Sonoran White Wheat Crespelle with Escarole, Homemade Ricotta, Tomato Sauce\u000a\u000aFaella Spaghetti with Bianco Dinapoli Tomato, Basil\u000a\u000aCrispy Potato Gnocchi with Brown Butter, Sage, Parmesean Reggiano\u000a\u000aApple Crostata with Crema\u000a\u000aRice Pudding with Orange Fig Marmalade\u000a\u000aHaving since rebranded the restaurant to Trattoria Bianco after installing a stone oven to make his legendary pies the first meal I enjoyed with my family after driving back from Las Vegas was at Italian Restaurant.  Having already visited the Pizzeria, Pane, and Italian Restaurant for lunch myself this was my first dinner at a Bianco restaurant and arriving to find the space bustling we opted to sit outdoors in order to avoid the noise; a big mistake that instead led to both captain and a server named Adam largely ignoring us throughout the evening as water went unfilled, dishes were dropped off without description, ingredient questions required further investigation with the kitchen, and epic delays occurred between each course, plate pickup, and particularly drop-off and collection of desserts along with the check.\u000a\u000aMoving past service issues, the food was every bit as good as the first visit, the housemade pastas and bread clearly a strong point while fresh local produce shined in a salad with bright, bold vinaigrette and beets sweeter than almost any I'd previously encountered.  Unfortunately replacing my all-time favorite corn and pancetta gnocchi with a slightly more seasonal version featuring brown butter and sage the dumplings themselves once again melted in the mouth while the crespelle, a crepe stuffed to bursting with creamy cheese and bitter escarole, topped with Bianco's signature sauce was rustic, simple, and  perfect - just the way Italian food should be and just the way Chris and his team make it at each of their restaurants.

VItems selected:\u000aApple Fritter\u000aPumpkin Cream Cheese Muffin\u000aJedi - Coconut White Chocolate Latte\u000a\u000aMoving on from Friendly Donut House with hopes of getting some work done prior to meeting a friend for breakfast at Layers a two hour stop at Las Vegas Weekly's "Best Coffee Shop" Grouchy John's would prove more than apt to the task in terms of style, service, and beverage even though baked goods severely lacked.  Friendly and efficient with a staff of baristas happy to engage the customer in banter about the myriad coffee concoctions or the day's events while satellite radio plays overhead and local art decorates the walls it was with some discussion that I eventually settled on "The Jedi," and although generally a double espresso or Americano sort I have to admit the flavor profile and mouthfeel were perfect while sweetness was not overdone, a sometimes-lost art that I appreciate for allowing the quality of the beans to show.  Moving next to the baked goods, the fritter room temperature while the muffin was lightly warmed, and having been told subsequently that neither item is made in house I will simply say 'good' as the former was flavorless and dry while the later possessed the texture of a wet sponge - a shame considering the vast number of quality local bakeries from which they could be sourcing instead.

VWith plenty of studying beneath my belt as lunchtime approached I next decided to hop across the street to check out Baratin, but with the daily menu not terribly inspiring aside from the dessert I instead popped next door to Bodega to see what local produce and meats were in - and apparently to buy a brioche donut (complete with the hole) and a brownie with dates and pecans plus a bag of FnB blend coffee from The Roastery of Cave Creek.  A small store but with a well culled selection of local cheeses and butters, immaculate organic vegetables and various salads, plus proteins like Jidori Chicken and Berkshire Pork from Tender Belly Farms I'll definitely have to make a return shopping visit in the future.\u000a\u000aMoving on to the items I selected, beginning first with the donut I have to say I expected better - sure the brioche was buttery and surprisingly light, but perhaps due to the time of day or maybe because the donuts were stored on an air-exposed rack the overall consistency was simply too dry.  Nicely flavored with what seemed to be vanilla tinged cinnamon sugar perhaps I just got a bad selection, particularly as the hole was much better.  Waiting for a while to tackle the brownie (after lunch, to be exact,) it would prove to be far more successful than the donut and having the option to select a corner piece I was particularly impressed by the heft of the cocoa notes and how the use of fruit helped to sweeten the brownie without making it overly sweet.  Clearly the result of quality ingredients and rustic as can be I will say that if you can resist temptation long enough to get it home a quick second in the microwave to enjoy it warm really helps as the melting pockets of chocolate juxtaposed against date, nut, and cake were lovely.

VWith proteins accounted for and rounds made of the art show my next stop was dessert and although there were other choices available the only logical choice in my mind was Mamma Toledo's, a spot I'd been meaning to visit since I arrived in Phoenix not only because the name matched my home town but because the eclectic assortment of pies available in three sizes all sounded great - particularly after reading owner/operator Tonya Saidi's roundabout way of arriving at a job she truly seems to love.\u000a\u000aA small truck - largely a delivery mechanism for pies made at home - the selection of pies at Mamma Toledo's on Saturday morning consisted of six pies, two pie bites, plus a cup o' cake and while every single one sounded good it was the Chocolate Coffee Pie and Carrot Cup o' Cake that immediately caught my attention - an $8 tab that weighed in at a substantial half a pound but far more in terms of quality and flavor.\u000a\u000aBeginning first with the cup o' cake, I have no idea what carrot to flour ratio Tonya used to make this beautiful item, but with the cake itself dense, bright orange, and sweet while remaining vegetal the self-described "Pie baking specialist" proved to possess a deft hand with non-pies as well - the cream cheese frosting adding a slight tang without overwhelming and the subtleties of the cake; pretty much everything one could ask from carrot cake and entirely without the nuts or raisins so many others rely on to liven up the mix.\u000a\u000aMoving next to the pie - let it first be said that if you've not experienced Mamma Toledo's crusts then you should search for her truck right now and order whatever sounds best because no matter what sort of pie you fancy her crusts are superlative- flaky like a croissant, loaded with butter, and crisp enough to support the filling without being 'hard.'  Moving next to the filling, while I can only speak to the single pie I tasted I'll simply say that this was great - a thick pudding of cocoa and espresso with a light cream topping that helped to mellow the bitter notes without overwhelming them at all - the only thing missing was a cup of coffee to wash it down...or maybe some ice cream; either way I can't wait to go back for more.

VCoffee:  The same nutty blend served at the SF Flagship and refilled even more astutely I particularly appreciated the low acidity, rich body, and availability of all 3 artificial sweeteners plus sugar.  At $2.25 for a cup that is literally bottomless I could see this being dangerous if I went on a day when I was with my books to read.\u000a\u000aBlueberry Cornmeal Hotcakes:  At $10.95 this is the menu item I would have ordered during my visit to the original had the Chocolate Chip Pumpkin French toast not been a chalkboard special and true to the rumors the hotcakes did not disappoint.  Golden and crisp on the exterior with a slight bit of grit to the interior crumb each of the three cakes was packed with bursting blueberries and slightly buttery even without the addition of extra.  Served with a side of pure maple syrup (the sort they charge you extra for at Matt's) if there is a better pancake in the Valley I'd be surprised.\u000a\u000aCinnamon Roll French Toast with a side of Grilled Ham:  A $12.95 chalkboard special requested without the cream cheese icing my dining buddy this lovely dish featured a house made cinnamon roll cut lengthwise, then sliced vertically, and finally dredged in rich vanilla batter before a trip to the skillet.  Golden on the outside, cinnamon sugar caramelized within, and served with a bowl of fresh fruit plus natural maple syrup and grilled Niman Ranch ham I'm pretty sure it would have been better with icing, but it was pretty darn good without while the ham was rich, moist, and suitably smoky without being too saline.\u000a\u000aSouthwest Biscuits and Gravy:  A gift from the kitchen described jokingly by the owner as "something you won't find in San Francisco" this small sample of one of the chalkboard specials featured a rich and flaky biscuit topped with smooth gravy rife with jalapenos and red peppers plus chorizo.  Clearly not a dish terribly concerned with being subtle I really enjoyed the texture of the biscuit and although my modest Midwestern tongue needed copious water to quell the heat I actually enjoyed how the bright acidity of the peppers helped to keep the gravy from being too thick and heavy.\u000a\u000aCinnamon Roll:  At $3.50 this cinnamon roll would prove to be good, but when compared to the rest of the meal really nothing special.  Served warm with the frosting slowly cascading down the sides of the buttery bun it is not that there was anything 'wrong' with this dish - it just was not nearly as good as the French toast interpretation even though it was equally amply endowed with butter and cinnamon.\u000a\u000aBlueberry White Chocolate Streusel Muffin:  One of two daily muffins and perhaps the steal of the morning at $2.50 this dense muffin was not only large in size but huge on flavor.  Served halved and warmed with a bit of cornmeal interspersed in the otherwise rich and buttery batter the highlight of this muffin was the smoothness of the white chocolate and how it melded with the rich streusel topping to form an ample foil to the sweet and tender berries.  One of the better blueberry muffins I've had in recent memory it took restraint to not order the chocolate chip coconut variation on the muffin as well.\u000a\u000aPeach Cobbler Crumble Cake with Whipped Cream:  While I guess I could fault the service here in that they originally forgot the whipped cream I cannot and will not do so because in all reality the addition of house made whipped cream to this $5.50 slab of cake was the very definition of gilding the proverbial lily.  Beginning with a batter as light as angel food yet unmistakably imbued with plenty of butter and sweetened local peaches what truly made this cake stand out was a tan ripple I can best describe as cinnamon butter cake running from edge to edge and a lightly toasted topping equally rife with the aromatic spice and just enough sugar to caramelize.  Bite for bite this was probably my favorite dish of the morning, but showing a bit of restraint given the day of eating yet to come I was glad to let some of it go home with my friend - to call the portion 'generous' would be an understatement to say the least.\u000a\u000aThe Verdict:  Bearing in mind my obvious predilection to breakfast sweets over breakfast savories and the fact that I'd been told all the Bay Area's recipes had been ported over faithfully I had no doubts that walking into Dottie's Scottsdale that I would like the food; what surprised me most was how much I enjoyed the scene and the service - both equally well carried over from San Francisco.  Having said before that Dottie's is one of the very few breakfasts I'd actually wait an hour in line for and living in a city where it seems everyone is willing to wait hours in line for Matt's Big Breakfast I personally see Dottie's True Blue Café as a sort of breakfast ideal - food good enough to wait in line for, but without the line.  I'll definitely be back - and likely at the exclusion of wasting a moment of a Bay Area vacation time or waiting in line at Matt's ever again.

VModeled after the CBGB Bowery store and featuring the complete collection of John Varvatos and Varvtos USA plus a small selection of lifestyle items like books and Vinyl this is high end done right.  Understanding that Varvatos clothing is not for everyone, often times priced well outside of my range, there is no doubt that the man is running his company right and as one of the better American Men's designers I remain a fan, picking up pieces when sales or circumstances allow.

A large space, both as boisterous and as brash as the chef from which it is derived, our party of six found ourselves in the more formal of the upstairs dining rooms and with a server not just capable but happy to trade jokes with us as the night went on one might say that we ate and drank too much, but with three courses each plus a quintet of shared sides plus a few plates of the complimentary bread I'd suggest we ordered just right - each of the restaurant's signature items making an appearance and all well deserving of the substantial praise.  From supple foie gras and one of the more impressive takes on pork belly onward to perfect Beef Wellington and gamy lamb accompanied by rich shepherd's pie each and every savory to land on the table was well conceptualized and perfectly prepared to medium or rare and with coffees and cocktails equally well-crafted nothing less was expected as dessert, the sticky toffee pudding perhaps the best dessert currently served in Sin City and reason enough for anyone to at least pull up a seat at the bar downstairs.

Formerly a pastry chef at Craftsteak and likely having fed me twice in that role it was a rather simple process of selecting personal favorites and paying a modest bill of $13 that led me back to the car with a half dozen selections and beginning with a freshly minted almond croissant it was love at first bite, the warm shattering layers and wispy yawning interior rife with natural almond flavors...no detectable frangipane, paste, or fillers...the best I've found in Vegas to date.  Moving next to the macarons, innovative flavors and excellent filling was unfortunately marred by cold temperatures but allowing the second half to warm proved an admirable bite, though not on par with the rest.  Taking a break and waiting until home for the rest a chocolate chip cookie served notice to a lovely rendition of the classic with dark and milk chips aplenty while the financier, in all its density and plump berries was Parisian textbook whether labeled 'tart' or not.  Last but not least, the puck of bread pudding received gentle treatment on a cast iron pan, griddled until custard began to melt, and filling my new kitchen with wafts of cinnamon and butter it will be remembered fondly as the first thing I ever 'cooked' in my house...and far better than anything I will actually cook anytime soon.

VComp disclosure:  Generally not one to visit chains - even mini-chains deemed best new concept by respected publications - I have to admit that when a fellow gourmand posted photos of the croque madame at Del Frisco's Grille's new brunch I swooned a little bit; little did I know that less than a week later I'd receive an invite to attend a complimentary blogger's brunch on November 3rd at 12:30pm. Equally fond of these events (perhaps less so) than I am of chains given the inherent biases involved I will say that I waxed and waned as to whether I should attend but after e-mailing and being assured that I could write as I like, I figured why not?\u000a\u000aLocated directly across from the Biltmore Del Frisco's Grille is a swanky space befitting the upscale location and with high ceilings, an airy design giving way to a lovely patio, and an open kitchen juxtaposing a well stocked bar and walls of wine the space has all the curves and contours of a modern top end steakhouse without feeling heavy or bourgeois in the least. Light and sexy with blonde wood, black lacquer, and beige tile throughout an added bonus on this particular afternoon was the four televisions each visible from the outdoor patio, each showing a different college football game.\u000a\u000aCroque Madame: A must order when present on the menu for myself but an item previously unknown to my friend this take on the French classic featured a rather young Gruyere along with American white cheddar cheese, thin slices of jambon, and light sauce Mornay atop toasty whole grain bread. Presented alongside a light salad with a touch of vinaigrette and topped off with an over-easy egg this would prove to be the weakest of the day's six selections largely due to the mildness of the ham, crustiness of the bread, and relative lack of runniness from the yolk.\u000a\u000aSouthern Fried Chicken and Waffles: I was admittedly a bit weary of this dish since many upscale restaurants seem to be tackling this southern comfort food trend lately but after some debate between this and the benedict I think we made the right choice. Featuring a trio of mini cornmeal waffles each topped with a crisp and juicy breast of chicken plus a strip of crispy hickory smoked bacon what really set this dish apart was the crystal hot sauce spiked maple syrup. Soft and doughy meets crisp and juicy meets sweet and spicy - perhaps it wasn't as 'down home' as Lo-Lo's or as refined as Bouchon but either way it was really good.\u000a\u000aBanana and Mascarpone Stuffed French Toast: If a picture says a thousand words then I simply suggest you look at the image above-from the caramelized bananas to caramelized crust on the custard soaked brioche this was amongst the best French toast preparations I've had in recent memory. Creamy meets crunchy and loaded with flavor even before the addition of Grand Marnier spiked maple syrup this was the dish of the afternoon without question and paired with the same thick-cut hickory-smoked bacon as the waffles the only thing that could have made this better was a tableside flaming a la bananas foster.\u000a\u000aRed Velvet Belgian Waffle: In the end these turned out to be quite good and far less predictable than I'd expected. With all things appearing in Red Velvet ever since the cupcake craze began my biggest fear was that there would be nothing "Belgian" about these waffles, but what arrived was actually quite impressive as the quartered waffle was slightly yeasty and plenty raised with a crisp exterior giving way to a steamy and soft interior with hints of cocoa as opposed to being over the top chocolate. Again graced with bacon and drizzled rather than slathered with whipped vanilla bean cream cheese the flavors were all nicely balanced and restrained-a very well executed dish and a great choice for those not wanting an egg dish but also not wanting something quite as sweet as the French toast.\u000a\u000aNutella Bread Pudding: With coffee, a great blend with good cocoa notes and a bit of caramel roasted specially for Del Frisco's, served I explained to our server that although I realized the complimentary dishes were limited to the brunch menu I would gladly pay the $10 for dessert as I simply couldn't justify leaving without trying the bread pudding...but in the end, no check arrived. What did arrive next, however, can only be described as everything Mike likes in one gooey pile with a crisp exterior giving way to a nearly molten center rife with buttery cubes of brioche sealed together with Nutella. While I'd be foolish to call the dish 'subtle' in any way since it is certainly not for those without a serious propensity for the hazelnut spread, the team at Del Frisco's actually did a rather impressive job in attempting to add some levity to the dish with a surprisingly light ball of nearly espresso intense house-made coffee ice cream drizzled with caramel. All in all it was my favorite dish of the afternoon and certainly on par with the bread pudding at The Mission for best in the Valley.\u000a\u000aMore in the blog...

A surprisingly large space featuring slick woods and polished surfaces throughout it was just after 3:00pm when we arrived for late lunch/early dinner and selecting widely from the menu inclusive of a $15 foie gras appetizer it was with the hunger derived from nearly 8 hours of unpacking that we waited, only to have every single plate arrive simultaneously thirty minutes later resulting in both an overloaded table and tough choices about what would taste best at room temperature or below.  Focusing on the food it should be noted that much of what was ordered actually came to the table exceptionally well prepared and beginning with the foie gras I was immediately impressed by the quality and presentation, a single vein the only flaw in an otherwise Robuchon-quality prep featuring a caramelized medallion alongside a semi-sweet salad plus creamy, rich croquette and moving next to crispy, complex chicken alongside the equally crisp but decidedly spicy fries it was with good fortune that the milk shake, albeit small, was present to quell the heat.  Overlooking the spongy, dense bao and tepid duck entirely lacking for crisp skin and instead assisting my mother with the lightly charred burger topped with woodsy mushrooms and aromatic marmalade it was perhaps with recollections of the zeppole at Settebello the day prior that I ordered the doughnuts and although not quite as impressive, the eggy brioche stood strong beneath a dense lacquer of sugar rounding out a fairly impressive afternoon largely warranting the $75 tab, if not a significant tip.

VIn its inaugural season it would be hard to call the Phoenix Festival of the Arts anything more than a dismal failure - a mere 40 artists plus some bands and organizations it was under-representative of the Valley's diverse art scene to say the least and yet at the same time it provided me the opportunity to do something I generally avoid; visit a selection of the city's food trucks - a collection of approximately ten which were present when the festival opened at 10am representing everything from lobster to pizza to hot dogs, barbeque, and pie.  Having already made two breakfast stops prior and with plans for Andreoli's Christmas Festival at 2:00pm I knew I'd need to save room and as such I perused the options carefully before settling on a trio...plus one en route back to the car.\u000a\u000aStarting with the most unique, a food truck concept I certainly never saw in the Midwest and would have never expected in the desert, my first stop of the afternoon was at The Maine Lobster Lady (http://www.mainelobsterlady.com/,) a truck described as "A Maine island girl, along with her very own lobster fishin' partner, serving the real deal Maine Lobster from the coast of Maine to the desert southwest!" and the menu, service, and accent all hold true to that definition in every way.\u000a\u000aPriced substantially higher than the average food truck given the quality of the ingredients my selections from The Maine Lobster Lady would be two - the first her signature Maine Lobster Roll with hot buttered lobster chunks served simply on a grilled roll.  Simple, fresh, and loaded with lobster this was about as simple as it gets and although small considering the $17 price tag it would be hard to quibble this quality of crustacean nearly 3,000 miles from its point of origin as it was every bit as good as that in Boston or elsewhere (where, incidentally, Neptune charges a whopping $22 for their roll.)\u000a\u000aMoving next to a more innovative, though less impressive choice, a $9 cone of Maine Shrimp Puffs arrived as a half dozen hush-puppy sized balls of medium sized Maine shrimp tinged with butter and herbs deep fried to golden and served alongside a zippy garlic aioli.  Tender but a bit too oily for my own personal tastes and with the shrimp far less snappy than the aforementioned lobster the aioli was a welcomed boost - a shot of flavor compensating for an otherwise disappointing dish; next time I think I'd go with the Whole Belly Clams or the lobster mac n' cheese.\u000a\u000aGood, particularly given the fact that it arrived from a truck in the middle of Phoenix, but pricey at $26 for perhaps a dozen bites of food I see The Maine Lobster Lady as a well conceptualized idea to fill a void, but not someplace I'd seek out unless I really had a craving.

VHeavy on wood - both reclaimed and polished - constituting everything from the floors to the tables to the open rafters of the ceiling I was greeted quickly upon seating by a young man named Spencer who, along with a female bartender, were apparently the only persons working front of the house that afternoon and with the menu presented I spent a few minutes perusing as Pearl Jam played over head and with my decisions largely made before I even entered the door I had a full glass of water and my order placed by the time the song ended and progressed to Radiohead; to say the least I agreed with Praying Monk's recent nomination for best restaurant soundtrack.\u000a\u000aWith the table next to me settling the check as I read and listened to the soundtrack move to Zeppelin, Stones, and Nirvana it would not be long before Spencer would return with my appetizer selections,  one hot and one cold, the first a $5 quintet of "hush puppies with tenderbelly ham and tupelo honey."  Crisp on the exterior and toothsome within featuring great cornbread flavor and a touch of brine from the ham each hushpuppy was surprisingly light and low on grease while the honey was delivered thin, warm, and in excessive portion on the side.  Great snack/bar food with a happy hour price of a mere $2.50 it would be hard for me not to order these on a return visit given my affinity for both cornbread and honey - ham included or not - but for Southern/Soul food purists it may be better to look elsewhere as the ham is definitely notable on the palate.\u000a\u000aFor the cold appetizer the $16 "F This" PB&J Foie Gras Torchon was one part of my original reason for visiting Praying Monk in the first place and served in a small sealed jar with a layer of whipped and compressed liver at the base topped by blackberry jam and house made peanut butter mousse I'd be hard pressed to name a better torchon or terrine under $20 outside of Paris.  Arriving as a 2oz portion of each layer alongside a small stack of toasted baguettes each aspect of the composition was nicely flavored and with the sapor of the foie balanced nicely by the unsweetened berries the peanut butter added a bit of salt and a light toasted flavor that lingered on the palate.  Having had far less successful attempts at Foie Gras with PB&J at notably more expensive restaurants I'd consider this a must order.\u000a\u000aWith the waiter, the bartender, a chef or two, and myself now being entertained by The Red Hot Chili Peppers my main course of "Kentucky Fried Quail" would arrive as I was slowly enjoying the foie gras and with the small bird surprisingly plump I again set aside the liver and moved onto the hot dish before me; the first bite a crackling of deep fried skin and lightly herbed breading that would set the tone for everything on the well composed plate. With small bones still present but easily navigable the quail itself was not-surprisingly lean with just enough fat to keep it juicy and with a the bird's slight gamey flavor well met by the breading even more levity and balance was found in the accoutrements - a mild lightly dressed slaw of Brussels sprots and "Red, White, and Bleu" potato salad featuring tender redskin potatoes, a touch of mayo, and punchy bleu cheese...unnecessarily upscale comfort food perhaps, but damned good as well.\u000a\u000aWith the hour now nearing three Spencer returned to ask if I wanted to see the dessert menu and with my mantra that it never hurts to look I said sure and received a short list of four choices, all of which sounded okay but none which sounded great, and as such I deferred to my server's opinion and he recommended the "Fourplay" based on his own personal preference for cheesecake, a good recommendation though certainly not on par with the savories.  Described on the menu as "Flourless chocolate cake, New York Cheesecake, Chocolate Cream, Milk Chocolate Parfait, and a Chocolate Fan" and mere minutes after ordering it was clear from the start that this was a pre-prepared dessert and while each texture was nice enough the cake itself was a tad spongy thus relying on the 'fan' to add a bit of crunch-rich but not heavy, cold but not frozen, the flavor itself was not all that different from a Hostess Ho-Ho...not a 'bad' thing, but at $7 perhaps the only overpriced item I ordered and an area where the Praying Monk could definitely stand to improve.\u000a\u000aWith the check settled-a veritable steal considering the gift certificate-and an ample tip added for the 1 to 1 service I sat for a few moments reading and listening to Beast of Burden before making my way to the door where the Scottsdale Sun had basted my car to a pleasant 121 degrees.  A long day of dining behind me and dinner yet to go I hope Praying Monk is turning better business on other days of the week-my guess is that it'd be an awesome place to watch some College Football in the coming months, particularly given the quality of the food (and beer list if you're into that.)

VThe Why:  Helmed by Chef Cullen Campbell and highly praised by local palates I respect Crudo seems to have all the things I'd hope for in a local restaurant; high quality sourcing, a strong sense of community, and a unique but focused menu - in this case raw seafood, hand pulled mozzarella, and house-made pastas.\u000a\u000aThe Service:  ...to say my service at Crudo was perfunctory would be an understatement.  Beginning first with kitchen timing; a 25 minute delay between course 2 and 3 (from pick-up to delivery) with my waitress stopping by twice to say it would 'be right out' is poor form.  Additionally, while speaking of my waitress, considering the fact that I was obviously interested in the food it would have been nice if she acted more interested in me as a diner - instead she did not inquire even once as to how I enjoyed a dish and asking questions felt more like attempting to drag forth information while she instead spent time describing the menu at length to a needy woman who wanted all her dressing on the side and modifications to myriad dishes.  Perhaps I'm a bit presumptuous here, but if someone is there (with, or without a camera) dining solo they are clearly there because they are passionate about the food and if a server chooses to ignore that it is evidence that he or she cannot read a diner and thus should not be in that position - particularly when the other servers were engaging their tables between each course and even brought the Chef out to say hello.\u000a\u000aCrispy Pig Ears - chili vinaigrette:  Setting the tempo early, this dish is all about flavor and while the texture is largely that of the crackling pork ears and chewy cartilage within the flavor is a bit sweet, a bit sour, a lot of heat and a lot of porky sapor.  Can't say I 'get' the price discrepancy (or why it is so difficult for restaurants in general to update their online menu) but this is a good choice at $5 or $7.\u000a\u000aButterfish - tomato, lardo, arugula:  Call me crazy, but I don't really get the fuss over this dish; sure the smooth texture and mild flavor of the fish are conducive to the overall flavor arc, but with the lardo shaved particularly thin and the oven-dried tomatoes quite intense there simply was not much here that could not have been achieved with a bit of salt and fresh sliced tomato; the flavor something akin to a bland BLT and the arugula not particularly notable at all.\u000a\u000aGrilled Mozzarella - tomato, grilled date, basil:  For my money the best savory course of the night - a strong compliment considering the fact that a lot of the food was quite good - this was simple and intense, each ingredient packing serious flavor and all brought into harmony by the smoky warm mozzarella.  Served with olive oil brushed grilled bread I'll note here that if you desire more than a single skimpy slice (with this, or with any other course) you should ask well in advance, and if you have my server ask twice as it is likely to be forgot.\u000a\u000aMushroom - mozzarella, truffle, egg:  I love eggs, but the overcooked white and half-set yolk in this dish really added nothing to the earthy amalgam of mushrooms and mozzarella.  Texturally accented by toasted brioche and meeting with a hefty drizzle of truffle oil (I do not believe any actual truffle was harmed in the making of this dish) this was without a doubt the most texturally interesting savory of the evening and although I only received another slice of bread after the remaining juices had turned cool I still wiped this one clean before sending it back to the kitchen.\u000a\u000aRisotto - Squid Ink, Chili, Tuna, Tomato:  Apparently a bit of a signature dish at Crudo (and the only one my server would offer an opinion on aside from 'everything is really good') I must say that although I've had better risotto in terms of texture, the balance of flavors here was really something else - a subtle sweetness from the tomatoes melding beautifully with light heat from the chilis and the confit tuna' bold flavor standing up admirably in the face of the slightly gummy rice.\u000a\u000aPorkbelly - smoked tomato agrodolce:  Fatty and funky with crackly skin resting atop toothsome and creamy polenta this was pork belly as it should be and showing a deft hand with tomatoes for the fourth of my five prix-fixe courses the smoked reduction here cut the fat perfectly - simply a great dish and a surprisingly large portion.\u000a\u000aApple Frangipane Tarte:  Outsourcing their desserts to Tracy Dempsey Originals I knew the quality here would be high and with a boring sounding panna cotta vs. a potted Tiramisu that looked quite good as my other options the tarte was a clear winner - the crust a dense shortbread and the filling a rich but light almond paste with caramel roasted apples topped off with a bit of whipped cream.  While I personally think any self-respecting restaurant of this caliber should be making their desserts in house it would be hard to quibble with choosing Ms. Dempsey who is now 4 for 4 in my book.\u000a\u000aGood - but I'm not rushing back.

Featuring fresh wasabi, house-made aged soy and creamy miso, plus an extensive sake list and dessert program responsible for the best mille crepe I've had to date my only regret in visiting Kabuto is that I did not book an earlier reservation and order the longer menu; a mistake I'll not make in the future.

VEverything that can be said has been said about this wonderful place, so I will keep it short.  The tiramisu gelato was rich, creamy, and otherworldly....possibly the best tiramisu I've ever had, but in frozen and transcendent form.  The $8 72% Dark Chocolate bar I bought for the lady?  Smooth, rich, and perfect.  The coffee......I guess it was coffee, but honestly it tasted chocolate infused......heavenly.\u000a\u000aMy buddy picked up a bag of the "hot chocolate" for his mother....as opposed to standard powder/mix, these were miniature balls of chocolate designed to be dissolved in milk.  Incredible.\u000a\u000aWhile the lines can get long and inconvenient, who cares when you can watch the mesmerizing chocolate fountain and stare at the incredible fondant cakes surrounding you?\u000a\u000aI'll stop by for a crepe next time, for sure.

VBest Tiramisu ever, both the frozen and the cake versions.  2 trips to Vegas, two wonderful tastes at Jean Philippe.....if I lived in Vegas I'd be broke and fat.....but happier for sure.  :-)  \u000a\u000aNext time the Nutella Napoleon has my name all over it.

Clearly a spot where the impressive beer list supersedes the quality of the food our meal started off on the wrong foot when we were denied seating in the main dining room and placed in a smaller back bar area and although the bartender was pleasant enough while a great soundtrack played overhead it became quite obvious early on that our lack of enthusiasm for suds was unappreciated with food arriving slowly, often far from hot while water refills required direct inquiry.\u000a\u000aFocusing on the food, a first round of appetizers proved to be fine, if not wowing - the pretzel nothing to write home about and the "do you want cheese with that" commanding an unannounced $3 up charge while the dates and pecorino were a nice sweet and savory pairing with quality ingredients well prepared.  Last and perhaps least, a basket of fries was ordered by my aunt and although I'm far from an expert I found them to be a bit undercooked; more starchy and less fluffy than I'd prefer.  \u000a\u000a Moving on to the meat of the menu (pun intended) aside from being luke warm and served on a decent roll I do not understand the reviews for the brats at Brat Haus and, as a matter of fact, with all the ridiculously hefty spices I'd defy anyone to differentiate on blind tasting the difference between pig, duck, or turkey on any of our selections - a lack of subtlety that led to my mother giving up after a few bites and even challenged myself on the duck brat as I felt like I was eating the smell of Penzey's Spices more than anything protein.  Faring better - as a matter of fact quite a bit better - my aunt's burger with a supple and smoky patty, fried egg, and sharp Swiss was the highlight of the savories; a case of "Keep it Simple, Stupid" if there ever was one.\u000a\u000aFor desserts - generally not a beer fan I actually liked what the rich chocolate stout did to temper the sweetness of the dates and the waffle that so many have raved was indeed a light at the end of the tunnel; a light, airy, and golden crisp disc with a bit of spice balanced by the sweet honey showing that the kitchen can indeed achieve balanced boldness when they try - or perhaps when they DON'T try and end up overthinking and overshooting their mark as they did with the sausages.

VItems sampled:\u000a\u000aChocolate Buche Noel\u000aCherry Scone\u000aBanana Cream Pie\u000aSnowman Old Fashioned Cupcake\u000aSmores Bar\u000aLatte\u000a\u000aA former pastry chef for both Charlie Palmer and Charlie Trotter, Megan Romano's pedigree is well known and with a cookbook already under her belt displaying a wide variety of confections both classic and completely unique I had high expectations for her first solo pastry shop, Chocolate and Spice.  Having already enjoyed breakfast at eat. but with plans to spend the rest of the day off strip our stop was somewhat impromptu but arriving just after 10:00am the shelves were still packed and with a latte for my friend we decided to sample a few items, some enjoyed in the shop and some saved for later with only a rubbery (and quite honestly quite unpleasant) s'mores bar and a bit too much frosting (an obvious decorative necessity) on the cupcake marring the experience.\u000a\u000aSpeaking to the items that shined it should first be noted that the service at Chocolate and Spice is exquisite - a smiling staff of young women working the counter and delivering each individually plated item to tables - and given Megan's background in cake design the bouche noel and body of the cupcake were both dense, moist, and aromatic - definitely a place worth ordering a cake for a special event or a special person.  Moving on past the cakes, Ms. Romano's scones are much like those served at Keller's Bouchon - a bit softer than the standard with a crunchy sugar coating and pockets of butter juxtaposing plump, bursting fruit - while the Banana Cream Pie, without a doubt the show stealer of the afternoon took 'flaky crust' to a whole new level and married it to bananas, banana pudding, and plenty of light pastry cream with a drizzle of caramel that rivaled Tartine, Susina, and Dahlia Bakery for 'best ever' bragging rights.

VItems Selected:\u000a\u000aThe Main Street - Sauce, Mozzarella, Pepperoni\u000aThe White Chapel - Mozzaella, Ricotta, Roasted Garlic Oil, Sauteed Spinach\u000aGarlic Knot\u000aCinnamon Bombolini with Cream\u000a\u000aWhile New Yorkers or the New York-centric seemingly love to tout the excellence of the "slice," it can only be said that I don't get it - a greasy pile of low quality pepperoni on overly sweetened sauce topped with cheap cheese supported by a foldable, dull crust simply is not my idea of pizza and no matter how many try to defend their favorite slice shops or memories of slurping down a 99 cent hunger stop-gap at 2am the fact of the matter is that most of it is no better than Sbarro...a few exceptions noted...and one of them right here in Las Vegas.  Dubbed "Pop-Up Pizza" by the folks at downtown's Plaza hotel and located just off the gaming floor Pop-Up is not a pop up in any true sense of the word, but rather a traditional appearing joint with white tiles, limited seating, and gas ovens behind a selection of pre-made and fresh pies ready to be fired (or re-fired) plus a few bonus items and with expedited but friendly service it provides a veritable bargain; my total bill coming to $9.47 before tip and delivered to my hands in less than five minutes.  Beginning first with the 'extras,' both the supple garlic knot and delicate brioche-style donuts with truly impressive house made sweet cream would prove to be quite well made at 50 cents each and moving on to the pizza itself I'll simply offer a 'bravo' to the persons in charge of sourcing and the team arranging the pies as each component came together beautifully - the sauce tangy but not sweet, the garlic aromatic but not overwhelming the fresh spinach, and the cheese of a whole-milk variety full of flavor and not with oil while the crust, still foldable, had good crunch but ample chew neither adding or detracting from the composition.  Still not even remotely close to the quality of many artisan pies but a step in the right direction, particularly for the slice-shop genre, and offering delivery throughout Sin City I still can't say I 'get it' but for those looking for an improved take on the nostalgia of childhood, or drunken nights in Manhattan, this is about as good as it gets.

VImagine Walmart but with less product and vagrants allowed to approach you begging for quarters in the store...got that picture in mind?  Okay, now place another Walmart just down the street with a complete line of products and no bums.  Now explain to me the necessity of this store.\u000a\u000aPerhaps its just me, but if I were homeless and strapped for cash I'd walk down Charleston a bit and beg at the Fashion Outlet where people are spending discretionary income at will...

VI'm of mixed opinions about Baymont Inn and Suites in this case - yes it represents a good deal to those who do have a car, but options are limited nearby and housekeeping needs some serious work.  Admittedly a fan of the 24/7 gym, the elliptical was broken during my stay and the treadmill belt occasionally slips - all this for a $9.99 amenities fee added on at the end of the trip.\u000a\u000aSure it is cheaper than on-strip options, but aside from the basics you also 'get what you pay for.'

VItems Sampled:\u000a\u000aButtermilk Bar\u000aRaised Glazed\u000aCruller\u000aChocolate Cake\u000aSour Cream Old Fashioned\u000aApple Fritter\u000a\u000aAlways happy to support locally grown businesses a two stop breakfast run on Decatur was planned prior to a Saturday meeting, the first stop for shared provisions at 24-hour Dulce Donuts where a half dozen for myself and a dozen for the crowd set me back a mere $12.50, the owner even kicking in a bonus cup of coffee in thanks for a $1 tip.  Calling a day in advance to find out when fresh donuts were most likely and told they were baked throughout the day but "almost always hot at 5:00am" it was just after 5:30 that I arrived and true to word, three varieties were warm to the touch as a pair of men prepared more through a semi-translucent window and starting with this trio the old adage about the early bird getting the worm again proved true; the sour cream a supple sugary meltaway, the fritter's exterior crunch giving way to light cinnamon folded with apples, and the simple glazed a yeasty pillow amongst the best in Sin City.  Fairing less well but still well made the cruller was a bit soft and although eggy inside certainly not meeting the high bar set by Donut Hut while the buttermilk bar was tangy beneath but unfortunately left from an earlier batch and simply dull in comparison to the sour cream - a factor of temperature, I'm nearly certain.  Moving last to the chocolate cake, sampled later in the day, it was actually this version that one of my colleagues raved about during our meeting but for myself I found the flavors a bit artificially sweet...deferring all but a bite in favor of another half of a fritter, now cooled but still excellent.

VSee the blog for more:\u000a\u000aWith Aileen and I arriving nearly simultaneously we entered the crisp new space only to be greeted at the front seating area by a pair of baristas standing before the Japanese Cold Brew contraptions and with everyone bright and smiling we were invited to take a seat anywhere we like, eventually settling on a four-top in front of the open kitchen.  Greeted next by our server, a delightful young woman named Hedda, and then by the restaurant's manager it was explained to us that the method of operation was to grab a menu and then order at the counter while coffee is done self-serve and with that in mind we perused the menu and the restaurant's interior before making our selections.\u000a\u000aWith the space largely empty at such an early hour (but later to fill to capacity as I sat studying till 9:30) we both admired the cozy industrial/shabby chic interior and with The Shins and Minus the Bear amongst the morning soundtrack the restaurant was lively but not loud, though a small group on the outdoor patio seemed to be having quite a good (boisterous) time.  Chatting as we waited it would not be long before the food arrived and purported to have overordered I personally thought everything looked just right when our table was filled - particularly as I sipped on my third cup of the Vovomeena's bold and intensely earthy brew.\u000a\u000aTaking notes from various culinary traditions including the Deep South, England, Ireland, Portugal, and more our meal started with a simple buttermilk biscuit topped with salted butter and paired with a side of strawberry rhubarb jam.  With a light crisp to the exterior while the interior crumb was moist and rife with lightly sour notes I partook in the top half of the biscuit while my friend enjoyed the bottom and although good on its own the addition of the jam was definitely more my style.\u000a\u000aMoving next to the one dish I'd probably not have ordered if I were visiting on my own, the "Banging Pocket" with Shreiner's Banger, Scrambled eggs, and smoked gouda wrapped in a pita was actually quite good, though largely due to the use of quality ingredients more than anything particularly done with them as the pocket of pillowy bread featured a nice balance of fluffy eggs, spicy sausage, and just enough cheese to make it 'stick.'  Neglecting the "griddled spuds" on the side largely because I found them a bit too greasy I will note they were quite tender and well complimented by the salt, pepper, and onions.\u000a\u000aNoting my propensity for sweet over savory at breakfast it was not until Hedda described the "Boxty" that we decided to order it and while it too was just a bit greasy the overall effect of the hot and crisp potatoes juxtaposed against the sour shredded apple and creamy but sweet mascarpone was quite nice.  A sort of sweet meets savory hash brown served with choice of meat I personally would have preferred to see the bacon, also Schreiner's, more thoroughly cooked but that is just a matter of personal preference as the quality of the meat was quite impressive either way.\u000a\u000aFor the next choice - the most expensive on the menu with good reason - the B.M.O.C. would prove every bit as good as its description would have you to believe.  Beginning at its base with a crispy waffle lightly tinged with vanilla notes and plenty of butter then subsequently topped with apples cooked down in maple syrup, a smoked pork chop, two poached eggs, and finally a crunchy Portuguese donut it would be hard to call this plate anything but gluttonous...or delicious.  In a dish where any number of elements could have shined, what truly set this dish apart for me was actually the chop - a smoky and savory slab of meat that was easily cut with a butter knife and fork and nicely matched by the intense sweetness of the rest of the plate.  Better than the famous "chop and chick" at Matt's and less expensive (without the line) this will, and should, become the restaurant's signature in my opinion.\u000a\u000aMoving last to the "dessert for breakfast" item that had originally drawn me into Vovomeena the day the menu was first published, the pain perdu was simply exceptional.  Featuring dense banana bread rendered into a custard style bread pudding and subsequently sliced to be fried up on the grill this was everything I want from bread pudding - crisp and caramelized on the exterior, soft and dense within, and topped with bold "whiskey caramel" sauce plus ripe bananas that push the dish ever-so-close to "too sweet" while still keeping things in check, particularly when matched with the Schriener's Sausage.  At $6.95 you'd be hard pressed to find a better breakfast dish in town and having sampled my fair share of bread puddings I'd put this iteration in my top ten.

VItems selected:\u000a\u000aNutella with Crushed Hazelnut and Raspberry Butter Cream Macaron\u000aSalty Peanut Butter Brownie\u000aRed Velvet Cupcake\u000aMaple Pumpkin Spice Cupcake\u000a\u000aComing away from a resounding failure to achieve anything at the local DMV without much planned before lunch it was in food that I searched to find solace for the morning and with a quick perusal of my GPS the perhaps unenviable task became the responsibility of of Tiffany Jones' Peridot Sweets, a small shop on South Rainbow suggested by a friend.  A cute space, open at 10:00am with a small but well culled collection of American classics plus a quartet of French macarons at prices far less affronting than those on-strip and in Summerlin it was Tiffany herself both baking and running the register during my visit and inquiring as to what she would recommend, in addition to my standard Red Velvet cupcake, a quintet of items was selected and at a total charge of $10.88 - the price/quality ratio without a doubt skewed to the right in terms of what followed, particularly the rich, moist cupcakes with thick yet subtle frosting and the dense brownie - also moist but anything but subtle with rich cocoa tones beneath a shellac of pure peanut butter.  Admittedly preferring my macarons of the crisp, light variety popularized by Herme or Laduree it was perhaps a matter of personal taste that I found the shell of each cookie a bit harder than I'd have liked but with an excellent break quickly melting away to smooth flavors it was the fillings that truly shined, the butter cream especially impressive and the sort of thing I could definitely see highlighting one of the bakery's custom cakes.

VFull review blogged. High points below:\u000a\u000aChicken Liver Pate with Poached Cherries and Tuscan Toast: To anyone who knows me this was an obvious choice and served in a flip top jar for $7 along with a pile of lightly oiled toast it was every bit as good as I would have hoped.  Dense and slightly rougher cut than a true mousse but rife with a mineral tinge below the liver's characteristic sapor the cherries served as a brilliant foil to the fat and easily enough for two this would have been the deal of the menu if not for the daily special.\u000a\u000aFocaccia di recco - ligurian style baked focaccia with fresh soft cow cheese and local honeycomb:  Perhaps the most consistently raved dish from both the Chicago location and from local gourmands who'd already visited Davanti Scottsdale the first time I'd heard of this dish was actually from our server at Avec and although slightly different in texture and composition this Ligurian classic marrying crisp focaccia with a stracchino/mascarpone blend was every bit as memorable.  Taking an alternate route to Avec's density and utilizing local honeycomb (an extra $2) as opposed to savory notes to balance the soft cheese's higher lactic acid content I'd be hard pressed to say who does it better, but at $18 I can only say this dish is worth the money even if it seems 'simple.'\u000a\u000aRoasted corn + walnuts + pecorino + arugula + wild mushrooms:  Wanting to sample from each part of the menu this choice from the insalate was recommended by our server and although I would have preferred to taste it warm (simply too many items on the table at once) it was quite good at room temperature as well.  Essentially the results of high quality ingredients paired carefully this was a dish about texture and flavor above anything else and with the mushrooms and corn each lightly cooked there was a great interplay of natural sweetness and earth all set off by the lightly applied cheese.\u000a\u000aTruffle egg toast + fontina + asparagus:  I'll start out by saying it wasn't as good as the incredible famous version at 'ino...but it was pretty damned close.  Oddly a fan of eggs at all other meals despite my propensity for sweets at breakfast this "toad in a hole" style presentation featured nothing more than a dense piece of brioche topped with a thick slice of young fontina lightly kissed with truffle oil and black pepper plus julienned asparagus on the plate beneath; it was simple, it was rich, and it was the one dish I really wished would have arrived separated from the others so I could truly enjoy it as opposed gulping down my half for fear of it getting cold or soggy.\u000a\u000aChef's Whim - Confit Roasted Half Duck + Sour Cherry + Mascarpone Polenta + Candied Pecans + Radish + Endive:  I'd wanted to try a pizza, but when our server told us the Saturday "Chef's whim" I fortunately changed my mind - and I say thankfully not only because duck is my favorite protein, but because this was one of the best duck preparations I have ever tasted.  Priced at a bargain $20 and featuring a half-duck split down the center served over a bed of mascarpone polenta and Amarena cherries whose texture would rival the finest gelato this was the sort of rustic preparation I'd hoped for walking in the door.  Intense and meaty with crispy skin giving way to tender flesh each bite of this dish was savored as much as the last and with sweetness from the cherries and pecans met by the bitters of the radish and endive the dish never felt 'heavy' at all.  Honest to God, ff this is on the menu it is a must order - I've paid twice as much for far less impressive fowl at any number of 'top tier' restaurants.\u000a\u000aChocolate Budino -Chocolate Pudding + Amaretto Cookie + Toasted Marshmallow:  Un-wowed by the standard dessert menu and myself with dinner plans three hours later we'd originally considered skipping dessert until our server told us the "Chef's Whim" dessert of the day was a budino - on par with bread pudding for 'must order' status for myself - and with a dense pudding of semi-sweet chocolate at its base subsequently topped with a warm amaretto cookie plus light meringue quickly toasted under the salamander this dish also wowed.  Thankfully small in portion but huge in flavor I'd place this dish among the must orders.\u000a\u000aThe Verdict:  Service and music issues aside, Davanti Enoteca is a great addition to the local dining scene and although much of the menu is cribbed directly from West Taylor St. the dishes where DeRuvo was allowed to flex his muscles were without a doubt the strongest of the afternoon.  Perhaps the gnocchi did not live up to expectations and would have been better sold as a gnochetti and maybe some would argue that the focaccia is a bit overpriced priced at $18 but all things being equal my friend and I walked out the door for $60/pp after tax and a more than generous tip for a meal featuring 7 good-to-great dishes, particularly a duck dish I'd put on the same level with versions at Gagnaire, Eleven Madison Park, and L'Arpege.

VFor this post we're talking about brunch, and let me first start out my saying that great strides have been made since my first visit in terms of both the soundtrack and the service- the former explained to me by GM Cynthia DiNardo as a simple matter of optimizing Pandora and thus replacing a three-peat of Tainted Love with a brunch playlist highlighted by Led Zeppelin's 10 Years Gone, Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here, and a few tunes Cream, The Who, The Stones, The Strokes, Modest Mouse, The xx, and even Interpol- and the later largely related to a young woman (with some really cool ink) and younger (looking) man who were courteous, personable, and efficient - present without "hovering" in a way that I hope for every time I enter a restaurant.\u000a\u000aMoving on to the food, my meal started with an amuse of sorts featuring the daily Bruschette of Mortadella, 20yr balsamic vinegar, arugula, and pistachio - four bites of rustic perfection with the house made bread crusty and warm and each ingredient presented in an elegant balance of both texture and flavor to highlight the cured pork.\u000a\u000aThe next dish to arrive from Peter was his heavily recommended "Uovo Barzotto," a hot skillet filled with a house made toasted English Muffin, Pork Belly Hash, Poached Eggs, Avocado, and Tomato Hollandaise.  Generally not one to go straight for the "Benny" but more than willing to trust the chef's instinct I will simply say that while I probably would not have ordered this if left to my own devices it actually turned out to be my favorite dish of the morning - a deft blend of vegetal flavors augmented by the creamy egg and savory pork - and as I mentioned to Ms. DiNardo when she stopped by my only "complaint" was that it did not come with more bread (or a spoon) to wipe up every drop of the first Hollandaise I've ever tasted that truly made me say 'wow,' an effect largely attributed to an unexpected lightness imparted by the tomato.\u000a\u000aAnother new feature of the brunch menu entitled Pumpkin Ricotta Pancakes with Pecans and Syrup would arrive at my table next and served in a "tasting" portion the single flapjack was lovely in texture but unfortunately somewhat light in pumpkin flavor until I added spread the honey-kissed butter and added the warm syrup, the sweetness serving to bring not only the vegetal notes to the fore, but also light saline notes and a bit of spice that I still cannot determine whether was in the cake itself or the syrup.\u000a\u000aNext up, a large pile of warm and toasty bread arrived alongside the vasi of Ricotta and Local Honeycomb.  Simple in preparation and flawless in execution there really isn't much that needs to be said here - if you like ricotta and you like honey this dish, much like the chicken liver from the previous visit, is a $7 steal and a little goes a long way - IE, it is probably best shared.\u000a\u000aSpeaking of things that are best shared, the pastries at Davanti are listed as $2 each and instead of asking about them I simply suggested they send me out one of each - a sizeable order to say the least with five different selections coming out along with salted honey butter and grape jam.  Apparently a concept set to evolve and changed each week with new options to come and go the day's selection for Sunday featured a warm cinnamon roll, fig and walnut muffin, honey sour cream muffin, cinnamon sugar donut, and chocolate marcona almond donut topped with cream cheese frosting.  Impressive in size and also in quality I personally felt both cake donuts were excellent as the lightly fried exterior gave way to a soft central crumb and although the frosting on the chocolate one could have been too heavy for some it actually worked very well given the heft of the cocoa.  Moving on to the rolls and muffins, the cinnamon roll was certainly the weak link of the board as it was simply too dense - as though not given enough time to leaven - while the muffins were both superb, the honey sour cream version almost a savory that went perfectly with the jam and the fig and walnut muffin a spongy cake that reminded me of a fig newton without all the unnecessary sugar.\u000a\u000aAt this point quite sated but not overly "full," I spent the better part of ninety minutes reading and listening to tunes while my cup of Lavazza received consistent attention from the staff and as the end of brunch service approached I was asked if I'd like anything else thus sparking a brief internal debate that ended with me ordering the Purple Pig Panini.  Paying homage to the Chicago Wine and Charcuterie staple while riffing it's most famous dessert what arrived next was far larger than I'd have guessed from the $7 pricetag but featuring that same fantastic house made bread this time wrapped around Marshmallow fluff (also made in house,) Nutella, and sliced bananas I knew that even as my server suggested he'd never seen anyone finish it that I'd be just fine...with those ingredients on that bread there's simply no way this dish wasn't going to be good.\u000a\u000aGo.  Now.

VItems selected include:\u000a\u000aCoffee\u000a\u000aBeignets - Made to Order with Raspberry Jam and Vanilla Mascarpone\u000a\u000aGolden Pancake Short Stack\u000a\u000aFruit Cup\u000a\u000aHuevos Motulenos with 2 eggs, red and green chili, black beans, peas, feta, sautéed bananas, corn tortilla\u000a\u000aShrimp and Grits with Ham and two fried eggs\u000a\u000aPart of the downtown Las Vegas revitalization, Natalie Young's "eat." seemed a great choice for early Saturday breakfast and keeping in mind the total dearth of Las Vegas traffic in the early morning hours it was a mere 10 minute drive from the MGM to the small modern eatery where we would find Chef Young already hard and work and an acoustic musician filling the room with tunes from Pearl Jam and Led Zeppelin as we sat down.  Designed as a sort of upscale urban soul food space for locals and featuring a menu both familiar but interesting, all composed of locally sourced fresh ingredients I knew right away that I was going to like eat. and although our server J.D. seemed a bit hung over (or perhaps just socially awkward) the moment food began to arrive my suspicions were confirmed.\u000a\u000aStarting first with great coffee, copiously refilled throughout our hour-long visit, and moving straight to shared plates of NOLA-quality beignets, crispy buttermilk pancakes with pure maple syrup, and a plethoric fruit cup it was obvious from first bite that Chef Young is not skimping on ingredient quality and although I favor sweet to savory 95% of the time the meal only got better when we moved onto our main plates; the shrimp snappy and sweet with exceptionally toothsome grits and the truly unique pairing of heat and sweet tossed with peas, feta, and two poached eggs quite unlike anything I've had before or since - the Motulenos an absolute must order and the restaurant more than enough reason for local or tourist to get up early and trek off-strip.

Sprawling in size with garage-style doors open to the cool morning breeze of a picturesque patio it was close to the rounded bar with a full view of both stage and kitchen that our trio found itself located mere moments after entry and with coffee kept brimming from seating to finale a six-piece order was crafted, each item arriving individually with smooth pacing and beautiful presentation.  Largely focusing on signatures but equally willing to explore seasonal preps and brunch-only items it was with the restaurant's oft raved pretzel bites that the meal began and with rich fondue gilding golden soft nuggets we all agreed that rare has a pretzel impressed so much, a similar praise heaped on the house burrata with seasonal accoutrements drizzled with aged balsamic.  Moving next to things more substantial it was admittedly with some disappointment that neither the $11 French Toast nor the $21 'worth the wait' fried chicken proved nearly as memorable as their respective milk jam or biscuit plate-mates, but with the former too bready and the later far from crispy there are simply better versions to be found elsewhere, particularly at such a cost.  At this point sated but certainly not full, the kitchen would quickly rally back with a duo of desserts and while the piping hot monkey bread certainly deserves the attention it has garnered it was the caramel-corn studded budino that stole the show for me, a dense pudding both salty and sweet with crunch and cream taken perfectly with another cup of coffee as Chris Cornell crooned overhead.

Grand in both scope and spectacle with ornate glass, open floorplans, and plush seating complimented by a staff of over twelve-dozen overseeing preparation, service, and customer needs my arrival at Bacchanal shortly preceded its 8am opening and greeted first by a cheerful cashier, then by assistant manager Stephanie, my experience commenced; the subsequent three hours adrift in 70+ of the buffet's offerings and a sea of smiles emanating from each employee and nearly every patron.  Divided into several sections with many offering cooked-to-order options including crepes and omelets it was Asian that my meal began and with fresh steamer baskets just opened the dim sum excelled - a small quibble in the thick-skinned har gow more than compensated by bao, duck and pork as good as that at Jasmine plus full-service congee complete with century egg, not to mention Sin City's best Egg Custard Tart later discovered at the dessert island.  Moving next to things more "American," one is well advised to monitor for items fresh from the kitchen as both the crunchy waffles and well seasoned chicken proved superlative while later tastes of waffle fries and tots fell flat - a fresh buttermilk biscuit, hot seafood preparations, and sliced meats including smoky beef ribs with caramelized crunch all showing far better.  At times a touch liberal in salt with Kung Pao Chicken and Risotto suffering the most, Bacchanal again shines in selections of shellfish, cheese, and charcuterie but with much eating to do and such things widely available elsewhere it was thoroughly in my sweet tooth that I indulged and although I passed up a few cookies plus a duo of sorbet suffice it to say that I nearly ran the gamut; cakes, doughnuts, pies, tarts, and more all justifying the calories with the aforementioned egg custard, pecan pie, cream puff, carrot cake, and citrus 'tiramisu' all warranting special mention along with the lovely pastry team who jovially tended to baking, saucing, arranging, and making crepes at a pace seldom to lull.\u000a\u000aSlightly more expensive than Wicked Spoon but making up the difference in complimentary champagne there are things to love about both of Las Vegas' premier all-you-can-eat experiences yet aside from a more expansive gelato case and my predilection to The Cosmopolitan's soundtrack I'd be hard-pressed to ever recommend it over Bacchanal.  Obviously limited by the constraints intrinsic to feeding anywhere from 2500 to 4500 persons in a given day yet defying the odds through a combination of remarkable customer service and striking attention to detail I'm happy to say that Bacchanal lives up to the liberally applied superlatives and although "Gods" may require something slightly more refined I'm almost positive they won't find it in such a format for less than $50, especially on Las Vegas Boulevard.

VOkay, seriously, this store is kinda badass.  As a new home owner I really cannot stress how much I hate the concept of overpaying for something like a clear vinyl shower curtain or an ironing board - essentials that really shouldn't cost all that much...and here they don't.\u000a\u000aAdmittedly some of the items here are not great - but if I can save money on the small stuff then I can happily justify spending that savings on something that matters like a nice couch.

VFull review in the blog.  This place has potential, but thus far that potential is not fully realized.\u000a\u000aseven plates, four desserts...and a $1 'bread supplement'\u000a\u000a"Shrimp and Grits," a savory and intense composition of sweet and snappy head-on shrimp atop creamy popcorn grits enlivened by charred onions and smoky pork glaze with a touch on honey.  Sweet and savory but perhaps a bit steep at $14 this was a dish where the ingredients and the execution came together beautifully.\u000a\u000a"Arizona Ricotta, Sicilian Pistachio Toast, Roasted Radish" at $8 arrived as a trio with only a single flaw - a dearth of salt to liven up the otherwise beautifully cooked radish.  A bit of a disappointment even despite the high quality of the tender taproot the dish certainly improved in moving on to the bread crisps as the ricotta was ever so slightly melted while the bread itself was herbal and crunchy but at the same time subtle.  With a bit more salt this one could be great.\u000a\u000aFor Duck Confit Meatballs, Foie Gras, White Bean, Tomato Agrodolce it would be hard to say exactly how/why such decadent ingredients did not live up to my expectations, particularly as the meatballs were tender and rife with flavor, but if I had to pin it on one thing I think it would be the expectations arising with the word "Foie Gras" and the $14 price tag as the sapor of the foie was largely lost to the tomatoes while the puree of white bean was okay, but mostly just filler.\u000a\u000aBerkshire Pork Belly, Kimchee, Udon Noodle, Fried Egg arrived with some joking at the table about the ubiquity of pork belly these days and as much as I cannot argue that said ingredient is delicious I just didn't find it well utilized here as the fattiness of the swine simply overwhelmed any semblance of kimchee while the noodles were soggy and limp.  Decent flavors though garnished by a rather inconsequential egg I had a few bites and that was enough.\u000a\u000a"Maine Lobster Fried Rice, Mullet Egg, Aji Amarillo" was actually a rather nice plate of risotto with a lot of umami and a touch of heat but "fried rice" it most certainly was not.  Nice enough, but certainly not a sharable plate, one of my tablemates summed it up perfectly when he commented that all this dish really did was make him want to go elsewhere and get a dish of "kick ass" fried rice - something he could have done at 1/3 the tab and had enough for lunch the next day.\u000a\u000aMoving last to a pair of sides, each $6 and far more generous than the rice, Grilled and Buttered Shiitake Mushrooms, Truffle Honey along with Grilled Broccoli Carbonara, Pancetta, Egg, Black Pepper arrived and where the first showed strongly in its simplicity the second fell flat once again due to a lack of salt - a lack so pronounced that frozen broccoli straight from the bag has more flavor thus making me wonder exactly what sort of pancetta was even present.\u000a\u000aButtermilk Blackberry Crumb Cake arrived as a dense butter cake with a downhome toothsomeness that I really enjoyed, but with ample notes of buttermilk dominating the sweetness of the berries I think this one could have benefitted from one of two things - a dollop of ice cream or a cup of coffee.  I'd definitely order this as a breakfast item anywhere.\u000a\u000aCaramel Apple Upside Down Cake, Salted Caramel, and Pistachio Ice Cream.  A long and linear presentation with the apple flavor a bit overwhelmed by the salty caramel but still potent and tart what truly made this plate shine was the ice cream - creamy, rich, and rife with nutty flavor...had we been dining earlier I'd have probably driven over to Sweet Republic for another round.\u000a\u000aUnder other circumstances Sacher Torte would have been the highlight of the meal and served with "Toasted Almond Amaretto Mascarpone Mousse" this one was a fine example.  Dense, intensely cocoa, and appropriately dry without suffering the Americanization of making it too birthday-cake in texture this was another dessert that would have gone great with coffee but the use of the mousse and bold apricot flavor kept everything balanced and bright.  It was awesome.\u000a\u000aIf there is one thing The House should keep doing from this point until the day they close their doors it should be keeping the Butterscotch Pudding on the menu.  A fan of all puddings - from rice to bread to budino - and having had a number of similar presentations elsewhere this version was simply outstanding - sweet and salty, dense and creamy, and bespeckled with chocolate and fruit adding both texture and flavor.  It goes on the short list for Phoenix's best desserts and will likely remain there for some time.\u000a\u000aOverall, The House is off to a decent start but still has a lot of room for growth in every department except perhaps dessert and décor.  A lovely setting already with great service I think the focus should start with improved seasoning and working to nail the basics before experimenting with 'fusion' and once the kitchen is hitting on all cylinders perhaps improving the portion/price ratio.

VItems Selected:\u000a\u000aKabocha Squash Cream Puff\u000aAnko Bean Cream Puff\u000aFuji Apple Pie\u000aMille Feuille\u000aRocky Road Crepe - Slivered Almonds, Pocky, Chocolate, Kinako Marshmallow, Whipped Cream\u000a\u000aA relative newcomer to the diverse Las Vegas pastry scene I'd originally been made aware of Suzuya by a friend suggesting the small southwestern store produced the best crepes in town; not particularly a dish I go out of my way for...at least until he also mentioned the phrase mille-feuille and caused me to dig deeper, my research quickly mandating a Saturday visit when already in the area for lunch with a colleague from at Born and Raised.  Small and neat, a simple pastry case and a crepe stone at the front of the restaurant with the kitchen in back and a few stools and chairs for dining in it was just after 10:15 when I arrived at Suzuya and with a couple picking up a custom cake while another woman, clearly a regular, stopped in for two-dozen apple pies I spent some time chatting with the employees about what was best, eventually allowing them to talk me into a crepe to go with a quartet from the case.  Clearly focused on fusion but well-versed in French techniques my tasting of Suzuya started with a pair of crisp and buttery choux puffs filled with traditional Japanese accoutrements and although I'd have personally preferred the squash to be more sweetened the red bean version was exquisite and the pasty textbook, a trend that would continue onward to the buttery lattice of the subtly sweet apple pie and a crisp mille feuille filled to order and garnished with Chantilly cream and fresh fruit - both every bit on par with versions from b.patisserie during my June visit to the Bay and as such amongst the best I've experienced stateside.  Clearly not leaving without at least doing due diligence to the crepe it can only be said that as far as crepes go this was about as good as it gets, the batter light and airy with a silken mouthfeel just robust enough to hold up to the equally light ingredients and a veritable deal at $4.75 which will see me back sooner rather than later to enjoy the mille-crepe cake or whatever Chef Misuzu and Plourde think of next.

VI defy you to find a better dining option in any airport - seriously.  While I'm an unabashed fan of LGO I have to say I'm shocked to see how well the quality carries over to this location and as a frequent traveler I only wish other airports maintained such high standards for their dining options.\u000a\u000aHad the Red Velvet Cupcake, Oatmeal Butterscotch Cookie, and Giandujia Croissant this time around and as usual everything was high quality while service is every bit up to snuff with the original location.  The best part?  No price hike for the airport location.

VNow at Town and Country, a whole new Rack to entice me into spending money.  Stopped by for the grand opening today and I can only hope they keep the place as nicely organized as it currently is.  Same quality as you'd expect from Nordstrom, great selection, and generally 1/3 to 1/2 the price.  No complaints.  None at all.

Dark and moody, almost romantic aside from the unexpected modern pop soundtrack, and decidedly more intimate than LoS as soon as one walks through the doors it would be mere moments after seating that we were greeted by our server and told of a few daily specials the laborious process of trimming our order from "I'll take the lot" to something more reasonable began - the end result ten plates of food including a double order of the truly remarkable century egg, a dish certainly amongst the ten best I've enjoyed in 2013.  Served in waves as we worked through two bottles of wine including a lightly sweet Riesling that proved an ample compliment to both heat and acid it was so frequent that someone at the table would proclaim their love for a dish that to describe them all would prove redundant, a simpler suggestion as relates to my palate being to order everything you can that features an egg or bird while disregarding any preconceptions you have about 'heat,' instead preparing your palate for complexity and balance.

Faring better, both in terms of ingredients and texture, I will admit that the Casanova was a good pizza with great chew and top quality ingredients, but for two pizzas on the exact same day to be so wildly inconsistent certainly gives me pause when considering a recommendation of Federal Pizza, let alone a return visit...not in a city where far better pizza can be found in abundance.\u000a\u000aA nice space for drinks, appetizers, and even desserts perhaps I'll give Federal Pizza a second chance at some point, but with Pizzeria Bianco, 'Pomo, The Parlor, and La Grande Orange all turning out a superior product there is no chance I'd wait in line to do so.

Say what you will about "first impressions," this was the sort that most certainly stuck out and probably colored the rest of the 'experience' aspect of Honey Salt - service lacking in nearly all regards as our waitress, Julie, neglected both empty glasses and dirty plates as she bustled around the room.\u000a\u000aMoving past service snafus to that which was presented on the plate I must say that things improved dramatically as soon as the bread basket arrived and focusing mostly on the sweet half of the menu crafted by Chef Esmeralda Serrano - whose work I was familiar with from her time at Tableau - every single plate that landed on our table was outstanding, particularly the Monkey Bread style sticky bun whose delicate balance of light acidity and sweet honey wowed with each bite and the thick, custard laden bread pudding whose richness found levity in a puffy cloud of whipped cream flecked with salt.  Not generally one to order savory at breakfast/brunch, it should be noted that even my friend's sliders were excellent - the beef so tender that it formed a sort of smoky stew/scramble with the fluffy eggs and cheese.\u000a\u000aHaving heard similar negativity about the service at Honey Salt I should only hope they iron out these kinks sooner rather than later because much like Raku this is cuisine more than capable of competing with the best of what can be found on the strip, but in order to be worth the travel a front of house matching the skills in the kitchen will be indispensable.

VI defy you to find me better coffee in an airport - anywhere.  Sticking with PHX Sky Harbor's goal of promoting local businesses the Cartel team is churning out the same great beans here as at their shops around town and the prices are no different.  Coffee here, pastry from LGO - if I had to be stuck in an airport on a long layover I can think of far worse places.

VSmaller than many of Summerlin's other green spaces but lit all night, at least on the running paths, I've really come to embrace this park as my morning outdoor running space during the early spring and have never disappointed in the maintenance of the property in the least.  Certainly the area could be a bit larger, but given the location and ample parking it is more than enough even for my longer runs...I'll miss it when the weather gets too hot forcing me back to the treadmill.

Playing on instincts and personal tastes but more than happy to allow the clerk to guide my hand it was with a few "standards" that I began and with the cupcake moist and dense beneath light buttercream while the baklava arrived crisp and intensely sweet the 'familiar' products would only get better from there, the macarons my pick for most Parisian-authentic in the city as a crisp bite gave way to a light crumb and filling that was ever slightly too thick, but nicely flavored and richly textured like that of Laduree at nearly half the price.  Moving on to more novel options, it was with personal interest and love for mille feuille that I ordered Manan's "crispy version" and with crisp layers divided by light cream before being rolled in fluffy icing and crunchy coconut-tinged flakes the Napoleon was not a bit soggy, just light, lovely, and perhaps the best non-traditional version I've experienced to date; an impetus for a later return to check out the 'standard' version which I'd venture to be equally delicious, particularly with seasonal fruits incorporated in the cream.  Focusing last on the two "must try" items suggested by my server, it was with the bird milk roll that I began and although good I personally found the cake to be a bit dry, my tastes instead trending toward the appropriately named "dream cake" whose Napoleon like crunchy layers of graham were divided by a lacquer of thick, nutty milk-jam while buttery crumble and light pastry cream added just enough levity to reign in the intense sweetness - a perfect complement to a good cup of coffee later that evening and something I'll absolutely return for soon, along with the Gata, Yojik, Manan Cake, Kartoshka, and Mikado...maybe the Smiling Cake, Nutella Napoleon, and Fruit Cookies as well.

V...while I didn't get dinged for the $10 parking that others have cited since it was after football season I really cannot think of a reason to visit these outlets as the vast majority of the stores and "deals" can be found at one of the HUNDREDS of local malls and/or shopping centers if you go during the right time or season.  Tack on the big crowds, bratty kids, and general ugliness of the complex and I cannot really think of a reason to return - Cole Haan outlet or not.

VLargely unamused by Starbucks, aside from the Reserva Ethiopian Sunroasted Harrar that they carry for ~2 weeks a year, but occasionally in need of a caffeine fix on The Strip where pickings are slim this particular location is a diamond in the rough.  Repulsed by Pikes Place, Blonde, and most of their burned and overroasted beans but generally pleased by a double espresso over a Venti glass of ice during the warm Vegas weather this Starbucks 'bucks the trend of doubling the price (Harrah's and Caesars properties) or charging an extra dollar for a Venti CUP (MGM,) instead billing the customer the same 2.65 as over in Summerlin, in New York, or in BFE Ohio.  Pair this with free Wi-Fi, Strip-side seating to watch the crowds from either the indoor bar or the patio, and generally short lines compared to Fashion Show's indoor Starbucks and the only thing holding this place back from 5* (for a Starbucks) is the single electrical outlet tucked away in the corner.

Housed in Caesars in a sizable space renovated from Bradley Ogden featuring plenty of wood, kegs, television, and Brit-kitsch it was just after noon when I sat down with two old friends and greeted by friendly, though pushy, service orders were expedited to the tune of an appetizer, a side, three mains, and two desserts - high prices and small portions tempered by a Total Rewards card...at least slightly.  Focusing mostly on signatures and favorites present since the menu's inception dining began with three small but lovely seasoned pretzels paired with cheese and mustard for $8 and progressing to plates proper another trio arrived in the $21 trio of small ramekin-pies, all well prepared but only the lamb loaded Shepherd living up to the high standards set by the exemplary golden cod selected by my friend, soggy 'chips' notwithstanding.  Ignoring the shortrib and what I'm told were vastly overseasoned potatoes while wishing some form of seasoning had graced the flavorless mushrooms it was with sweet redemption that desserts both shined, the rustic Sticky Toffee Pudding every bit as good as the fancy version at Steak and the "DIC" a bowl of buttery custard hefty with raisins and aromatics that I'd gladly return for along with a cup of coffee - breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

Admittedly a bit turned off by the "premade" croque alongside the fact that almond croissants would not be ready until the ambiguous "later" it was a relatively large sampling of the restaurant's wares that we selected on Saturday morning and aside from a slightly doughy blueberry cream twist the results were textbook, inclusive of two of my very favorite items.  Beginning first with a quartet including a warm butter croissant, flaky and natural almond tart entirely devoid of frangipane, and a Kouign Amann still warm liquid at the core it was actually the dense Baba Au Rhum that proved the shocker of the morning with ample booze but gentle sweetness beneath the light cream.  Impressed enough to purchase some items to go it was perhaps the delay in consuming the twist until later that rendered it flaccid and unable to suffer the same fate both the chocolate chip cookie and more so the buttery palmier would prove the best I've found in the Southwest; all the more impetus to call in advance before my next visit to make sure the Almond Croissant is warm and ready.

VStrange layout to this Panera in Boca park - almost seems backward if you enter from one side and featuring a long layout instead of the typical open design of most Panera locations in Las Vegas and back in Ohio I just cannot see the point of visiting this location very often when Sambalatte is just down the way.  Free Wi-Fi is fine and freely refilled coffee is okay too, but there isn't really anything here I'm going to eat so in that case I'd sooner stay home and use my own internet while drinking better coffee.

VItems selected:\u000a\u000aBlueberry Cake, Cherry Cake, Sweet Potato Cake, Maple Bacon, Cookies n' Cream, Campfire Smores, Apple Fritter, Fat Elvis, Strawberry Shortcake, Salted Caramel Twist, Peanut Butter and Jelly, Date with a Nutty Pig\u000a\u000aHappy to see the cupcake fad come and go yet still sustain with some of the better places I have to admit that even as a child I'd always take a doughnut over a cupcake, pie, or cookie...I mean honestly, is there anything more American than deep fried dough?  Taking this fact into account and having been to many of the nation's best doughnutteries I was surprised when I heard about an artisan doughnut shop in Las Vegas called Pink Box, quickly doing my research and sending an e-mail to the shop in order to reserve a dozen for a meeting with some friends.  Answered promptly by a man named Rodney who I would also meet me at the store after an elderly greeter said hello and opened the door for my entry I was happy to find my order all boxed up and ready to go, particularly with a price tag less than 1/2 of what one would spend at Doughnut Plant, Dynamo, Voodoo, or Top Pot.  Chatting with the staff for a bit before making my way to the car and to my awaiting friends it was our mutual agreement that not only did the doughnuts benefit from being very fresh but also that while some places do one 'style' better than the others Pink Box actually does a very admirable job with cake and raised, filled and fritter alike.  With classics like the blueberry cake crisp and minimally oily juxtaposing a truly inspired sweet potato cake doughnut that resembled the namesake pie in flavor my friends were most taken by the Peanut Butter/Banana Fat Elvis and the Campfire S'mores while I was personally wowed by the Nutty Pig - a yeasty bavarian with maple icing, dates, bacon, almond, and blue cheese - as well as the crispy salted caramel twist, the texture somewhat akin to a cruller meets a buttery pretzel thick with sticky caramel visibly flecked with coarse sea salt.

VFrom the time when she still sold at La Grande Orange to Roosevelt to Central to the Old Town Farmer's Market to Vincent's Camelback Market I've made my rounds on the Tammie Coe collection and thus far have found no difference in quality from place to place and as such my review is the same for each.\u000a\u000aItems experienced thus far include:  Snickerdoodle, Chocolate Pumpkin Muffin, Maple Bacon Scone, Ooey Gooey, Red Velvet, Dark Cocoa Caramel Ooey Gooey, Carrot Cake, Blackberry Bran Muffin, Portobello Tart, Cinnamon Roll, Plum Streusel Brioche, Almond Butter Pastry, Tammie Coe Butterscotch Crumb Bun, MJ Flourless Chocolate cookie, Tammie Coe "Betters" Cookie, Tammie Coe Blueberry Coconut Tart.\u000a\u000aTrained from a young age, first by family and later formally, and known by both those who are interested in the culinary arts and those who simply have money to spend on a beautiful wedding or birthday cake I first experienced Tammie's pastry during my interview trip to Phoenix when her goods were still on display at La Grande Orange and as good as her oft raved cupcakes (which I'm told are comparable in texture and flavor to her famous designer cakes) are it is three of her less 'famous' items that make her pastry, in my opinion, 'destination worthy' - the Streusel Brioche a sort of portable French Toast hand Pie with a custard center and bruleed top, the Almond Butter Pastry a dense baton coated thick with confectioners' sugar and a texture somewhere between a buttermilk biscuit and a croissant, an finally the incomparable Crumb Bun whose swirls of sugar shellacked pastry peel away like that of a cinnamon roll with a texture akin to a Kouign Amann only to reveal pockets of rich butterscotch streusel...\u000a\u000a...and yeah, those ooey gooey cupcakes aren't too shabby either - a perfect cake:frosting ratio that, although very sweet at first, gradually reveals the tang of the cream cheese leading to balance - and for those who'd prefer something less sweet I'll also vouch for the impressively moist muffins or the truly inspired tart; a sort of Italian style macaroon meets blueberry muffin.

VGrowing up near (and often at) Cedar Point I have to say most amusement parks fail to stack up and most "thrill rides' lack much thrill, a first world problem to be sure, but one that left me with little desire to experience any of the rides when I visited the top of the stratosphere...at least until a middle age woman approached me and offered me a free pass to ride insanity with her son, the lady herself not particularly keen on "spinny rides that make me want to puke."\u000a\u000aAdmittedly a shorter ride than anticipated, perhaps 3 minutes in duration, and slower than options like chaos or the witches wheel the gist of the ride is simple - a bit of centrifugal force, a whirl of lights, and a touch of nausea - but bolstered by the 109th floor location and the screams of young and old I can certainly think of less thrilling rides, and far less interesting views, especially for free.

Located in the corner of a space best defined as 'questionable' and more appropriately 'seedy' I was admittedly impressed at how separated Fat Choy seemed from the casino and how well the smoke from the slots was excluded from the dining experience and after getting past these issues I was even happier to find the service aspects of the restaurant far better than the typical "Chinese restaurant" and actually on par with many high end places on the strip.  With a small crowd of varying ages and ethnicities I made a simple inquiry about the shrimp toast (not typically on the brunch menu) and was assured the chef would be happy to prepare it and although each dish I ordered was good the funky sausage juxtaposing shrimp and tinged with spicy mayo all melded together with a fried egg was undoubtedly the 'must try' dish of the meal.  Opting next for a crunchy waffle topped with somewhat mundane chicken and a bit of Sriracha spiked syrup alongside the signature Duck Bao - a great rendition with pillowy bread, crisp skin, and snappy pickles all playing for center stage - I think it is safe to say that sticking with less "American" food is in one's best interest, though the fusion focused crisp roti topped nutella, rich mascarpone, smoky walnuts, and ample honey makes me think that perhaps something like a Korean style chicken and waffles could be just the right thing to add to the menu.

Located in a typical strip mall on West Flamingo and featuring a concept self described as 'Japanese tapas' the evening began with the simple decision of bar versus table and opting for the later amidst a warm yet stark interior it was to the tune of a shared $95 omakase plus several supplements that the meal unfolded - an invigorating paco-jet concentrated cucumber amuse setting the stage for what would follow.  Beginning first with a trio of fried happy hour bar-snacks from which the 'best' would be impossible to select and then transitioning into several amply portioned plates both cold and hot it was early on that a consistent pattern of superlative proteins over bright citrus and subtle aromatics emerged, the Suika Saka and Sakana Yaki particularly enthralling while the slightly overcooked Niku Berry's beef proved that a mélange of mushrooms can truly save a plate, particularly served point/counterpoint with tart early-season strawberries.  Rounding out savories with the crunchy Age Maki, an inspired take on Mexican Street corn dressed with briny uni, plus a $9 bite of slightly overseared foie gras cribbed direct from Austin it was at long last that we transitioned to sweets, a trio ordered but four delivered and all amongst the best I've experienced from Eastern influenced cuisine - the mango 'yolk' of the panna cotta and banana pudding-come-crème brulee Kanmi-O both on par with the pastry at Robuchon or Twist at half the price.

Opened early this year after a trekking the catering and festival scenes the concept of The Cookie Bar admittedly seems a bit kitsch up front but with boozed-up riffs on classic American confections befitting the moniker of Sin City lining the shelves and comparatively low prices by 702 standards it can only be said that "bar food" jokes aside these ladies can really bake.  Featuring intoxicating flavors both alcohol-infused and virgin it was with a duo of tender triple-chocolate 'Buzzkill' cookies that I began and with soft centers amidst crisp edges the classics tasted oven fresh, a characteristic no less notable in the red-hot cinnamon snickerdoodle, both individually bagged options a mere $3 and just as delicious as upcharged versions found on-strip.  Moving next to a similarly priced beer-brownie punched up with a tablespoon each of Guinness and Bailey's before transitioning to the actual 'Punch' of the densely spiced and cakelike Drunk Pumpkin it was last that I turned to a veritable 'best of both worlds' in The Kitchen Sink, a 6oz block of flavor with textures harkening fudge while flavors hollered Reese's - an Oreo version also available and beckoning me back along with the Vodka kissed Krispies and signature Booze Munch.

VA bit of a strange spot given its off strip location and obvious focus on Rock music.  Patrons seem a bit more Hollywood than the typical Vegas Casino, particularly when big shows are in town.  Absolutely loved the acoustics at The Joint and the Varvatos Bowery store, though dining options need some work.  Given the combination of Varvatos and the music I'll undoubtedly be back.

Considered by many to be one of the best buffets in the city and housed in a breathtaking room where floor-to-ceiling windows joyously exploit the twice-hourly water-dance outside it was to the left of the ornately decorated space that I found myself sat and with lightly roasted coffee adding $4.50 to the base $58 my meal began, a tableside pastry tower presented from my server whose interactions would otherwise prove perfunctory at best.  Small in size but diverse in selections with steamer tables, chilled sections, prep-to-order, and a whole room of desserts it was with Asian options that I began and with sliced to order Peking Duck on warm bao the star of the show both dim sum and crab soup would show equally well while congee proved mealy and flavorless leading me to overlook the noodle station in favor of things more unique.  Focused next on cold tables it was in exotic ingredients and iced shellfish that Jasmine hoped to justify its pricetag and although the King Crab was fine while foie gras pastry proved addicting the sushi, cheeses, charcuterie, and salads were rather pedestrian - a toothsome muesli better fitting as dessert a rare exception to the rule.  Moving through more "American" selections including a decadent pot pie, two delicious benedicts, and casserole-style French Toast imbued with banana and Nutella while quickly discarding flaccid waffles and dried out breakfast breads it was finally in sweets that nearly everything excelled - a well culled selection from which I nearly sampled the gamut - a Jean Phillipe's gelato station, perfect puffs of choux, and DIY fondue all receiving repeat visits with Asian pastries decidedly conspicuous in their absence.  Undoubtedly a special space but maligned by service faux-pas necessitating requests for refills plus clean utensils suffice it to say that although 'luxe' in many ways a brunch at Jasmine does not come cheap and while some items shined none but the duck was on par with Wing-Lei's Chinese New Year while neither service nor selection were equal to Wicked Spoon which rings in at nearly half the price after tax, tip, and drinks.

VSomewhere between a comedy show and the world's most amusing professional karaoke-cover band I was lucky enough to visit Raiding The Rock Vault with a friend and although I entered a skeptic I emerged having experienced something I can truly call "a blast."  From the quality musicianship of the entire band as they rolled through Zeppelin, Floyd, Stones, Eagles, ZZTop, Aerosmith, Boston, Journey, AC/DC, and many more over two non-stop hours to the brief skits in between there is rarely an unamusing moment for the classic rock junky in the LVH Theater and while the guys on stage are excellent the people watching almost steals the show - a motley crew of half-drunken to fully-sloshed Baby Boomers rocking along to the tunes of their youth.  \u000a\u000aHaving seen aged rock acts such as Deep Purple, Boston, and Foreigner at various festivals over the years suffice it to say that the artists at Raiding The Rock Vault are 'even better than the real thing,' at times.  To this point the best show I've seen in Vegas - sorry Elton and KA.

A large space with brick walls, wooden floors, and unfinished ceilings plus plenty of space to spread out and enjoy a pastry and coffee or a full breakfast it would not be long before I arrived at the pastry case and after sampling pieces of both the White Chocolate Pistachio cookie and "Lulu's Signature" cookie I placed my order for five items, each boxed or bagged individually, and made my way to the car.  Saving much of the sampling until later in the day but beginning with the Nutella Croissant as it was the only item still warm from the oven I was quite impressed by the quality of the laminated pastry as a shattering exterior gave way to a wispy open crumb that held up to being split and lacquered with a layer of hazelnut-chocolate cream admirably though an almond croissant sampled later on was less impressive, the exterior still crisp but the interior slightly 'bready, though thankfully not overdone with frangipane and actually quite subtle, which I enjoyed.  Moving on to the sweeter selections, the oatmeal cookie proved competent though nothing to write home about while the cupcakes each featured a nearly angel-food texture, the cannoli version not terribly interesting once past the interesting frosting and embedded cookie but the peanut butter and jelly quite excellent with fresh preserves and chunky nut butter piped deep into the cake's core.

VLimited in discs but loaded in vinyl and featuring a well culled selection at excellent prices it should go without saying that Moondog will never replace my love for Used Kids in Columbus but in a city with so many big box stores and glitzy overpriced options there is something charming about a place like this - a fact that given its close proximity to my place of work will undoubtedly lead to repeat business.

Featuring a menu heavy in reinterpreted bar foods, enough televisions to watch every game on NFL Sunday Ticket simultaneously (apparently part of the future plan,) and a soundtrack with a little too much Journey and KISS for my tastes the decision was made largely to stick with items recommended by the staff and not particularly a beer aficionado I opted for one of their 'limited edition' Aviation's as well - a truly excellent cocktail liberally spruced up with crème de violette.  Speaking to the quality of the food I found much of what I ate at Pub 1842 to be quite good - the pretzels soft and salty with a poached egg gilding the proverbial lilly along with the beer cheese while the reinterpreted deviled eggs were also excellent.  Less impressive, both the spring rolls and the mushrooms came off far too oily and while the duck paire with mint and cilantro was at the very least tasty the mushrooms were actually rather terrible and flavorless, a fact I mentioned to my server with the item subsequently stricken from the bill.  In traditional Mina fashion dessert proved a strong finale to the meal, in this case featuring a "buckle" that ate more like a soufflé pairing sweet peaches and a caramel shake with boozy toffee sauce, a great variance of texture, temperature, and flavor that I'd gladly return for along with a cocktail and a few non-fried snacks during Saturday or Sunday football.

VHaving now sampled the hybrid pastry on both coasts and points in between, including the original Cronut after an amusing two hour wait at Dominique Ansel it was to swanky Vegas newcomer Press Lounge at the Four Seasons that Saturday morning led me and with valet, doormen, smiling servers, and pleasantries aplenty it was just after 7am that I arrived to find a trio of still-warm "New York Style Donuts" lined up beside a few other pastries, a duo selected at $4:50 each and boxed with great care as my car idled out front.  Ever service oriented and eager to please even as I snapped a few photos before tasting the goods it was first in the lightly sugared option that I indulged and featuring delicate laminated pastry beneath a light exterior crunch without a hint of oiliness this is as close to the 'original' as I've found, a supple interior chew harkening a simple butter croissant but unmistakably a donut as well - an effect replicated in the rich chocolate option, though with far more 'mess' as the heated ganache slowly dripped through the donut's hole with each bite through innumerable golden layers.  Admittedly still a fan of the slightly more nuanced, crisp, and less sugary "O-Nut" at DK in Santa Monica or that found locally at Coco, for those looking for an Ansel-esque croissant-donut without the airfare and 2+ hour line it is hard to argue against either "America" at New York-New York or Press, though with similar pricing the latter proves far more appealing to those adverse to navigating construction or a smoky casino floor.\u000a\u000aFor now I'll score this place 4 stars given the limited pastry menu, but dinner may change that soon if the small plates and desserts menu proves equally impressive.

Allowing the cops to go first as I browsed the options with the enviable task of spending a $20 gift certificate I was immediately taken aback by the low prices displayed below each item and fortunately en route to a brief morning meeting my selections ran a nine item gamut, the total bill a mere $21.45 and only a soggy cannoli and overly sweet baba proving anything less than impressive.  Admittedly a touch slow in service as the owner tended to both the café and drive-thru it was with a warm fig strudel that my Wake Up tasting began and with shattering layers around sweet fruit my hopes for the rest soared, the boxed options experienced two hours later with much sharing and praise from my two colleagues but the glut of the bounty left to me.  Trending light to rich alongside bold coffee both the macaroon-crisp walnut roll and reinterpreted napoleon offered serious textural contrast overlying mild flavors while traditional takes on the chocolate chip strewn blondie and dense baklava rivaled the city's best - a sentiment I can only assume to be true of the novel cream-meets-crunch Bird's Nest and a condensed milk sweetened graham and walnut butter "Honeymoon Cake" similar to the more appropriately titled "Dream" Cake at Manan.

A small shop cleverly appointed with cutesy décor and a few traditional packaged candies to go along with an extensive list of boba, frozen confections, waffles, ice cream cakes, and even French fries it was to a small line that I arrived and after a short wait what followed can only be described as plethoric tasting session including sweet cream, butter pecan, jackfruit, lychee, cake batter, cheesecake, ginger, Thai tea, and more before settling on a traditional trio of Taro and Azuki Bean Ice Creams plus Black Seasame Gelato, a scoop of mochi and a spritz of whipped cream adding texture and the entirety of the amalgam impressively well flavored without being overly saccharine in the least.  Perhaps not as 'trendy' as Snowflake - though also serving snow ice - or esoteric as Art of Flavors - though with a much more extensive menu - and featuring lovely service in a pleasant setting there is no doubt in my mind that this will not be my last visit to Mixers; the avocado boba smoothie, red velvet waffle sundae, ice cream cake pops, and churros are all calling.

VWith my current lease due to expire during an upcoming vacation I visited Planet Mazda largely to browse, but given the current deals and an offer to pay off my current lease that 'look' turned into an upgrade; a strong team of sales folks pulling off all the traditional car dealer stereotypes of attempting the upsell followed by agreeing to customer terms when you suggest you are willing to walk.  Wide in selection with clean facilities and an attitude willing to negotiate I'll happily stick with Mazda for the next three years - it was their customer service that won me over last time when living in Ohio and the team shined again here in Vegas, even though I did find it odd when a young clerk suggested that because of my job he figured I'd 'want something more prestigious.  Have a little more faith in your company, folks - not everyone with a few letters after their name feels a need to sit in traffic on the 215 driving 15MPH in a Porsche.

Large in size and seemingly crafted from an old barn with comfortable communal seating amidst the glow of two-dozen televisions and gentle fluorescent lights it was mere moments after entrance that we were greeted by our young waitress and although not much help on the enormous beer list her service proved competent, each of six plates and six beers brought with good pacing and wide-smiles as water glasses continually brimmed full.  Unable to speak to the beer flight but impressed by the $12 tab it was with bar-food-staple soft pretzels alongside squeaky curds that we began and with both golden bites proving plenty salty it was the sauces that served as game-changers -  the funky bleu, beer cheese, and queso all remarkable.  Moving next to things more substantial it was to a truly cheesy trio that we were next treated and although the pizza could have tolerated a few more minutes in the oven to firm up the crust I was more than impressed by the ingredient quality across the board - bright Romas and fresh basil on the pie while crisp bacon and snappy apples graced the toasty sandwich, a skillet of tender macaroni under a blend of cream, cheese, and breadcrumbs rounding out the troika.  Never one to end a good meal without something sweet it was last but not least that we rounded out the evening with a steamy skillet cookie riddled with chocolate chips and eating more as a pudding than a cookie beneath Blue Bell Vanilla as Gaborik ended the game I couldn't help but smile...they just don't do sports bars like this back in Ohio.

VStill one of the most overpriced airports I've ever had to park at, at least East Economy Parking with the new monorail can get the cost below $10 a day.  Cheers to the friendly folks driving the trams to keep people from suffering too long in the desert heat, but at this cost I'd still appreciate more shaded areas in the lot.

VLocated between Aria en route to The Mandarin Oriental this small gallery features one of the largest Chihuily collections available for purchase in the United States and although there is a good chance most of us could not even justify a $5400 bowl after a big jackpot the staff is incredibly accommodating, educational, and informative - qualities far removed from much of the gallery scene both here and across the country.

Featuring a slice counter plus a handful of primi, pasta, salads, and desserts alongside 16" pizzas cooked in a 550 degree oven the "style" of McClain's signature pies falls somewhere between traditional New York slices and a Roman lightly-leavened 'crunchy' crust but with ingredient quality meeting the standards set by Sage the results were largely impressive save for the excessive use of oil and salt marring the Truffle and an unannounced red sauce lending a peculiar barbecue note to the North Beach.  Faring better, a simple Margherita assuredly displayed the restaurant's sourcing with tangy tomatoes and fresh basil while the Blanca shined largely to a thick dollop of house-made ricotta on each slice.  Moving past pizza, a sampling of the cannelloni proved to be my favorite savory of the day, albeit slightly overpriced at $18 for two pasta tubes stuffed with tender pork and topped with creamy Bechamel plus meager truffle shavings while a trio of arancini presented a unique riff on a classic by substituting house cured pepperoni for traditional sausage and pairing it with thick, aromatic aioli.  Never happy to leave a restaurant without dessert, a final pairing arrived at the table in the form of a small apple pie with accoutrements both sweet and savory alongside fried brioche cubes paired with sour cranberry sauce; both sweets trumping any of the savories and a saving grace at the end of a meal that fell short of high expectations.

Small and intimate despite the brilliant white backdrop and with excellent service that is formal yet friendly the basic format of Sweets Raku is that of a three course dessert tasting with a few supplemental savories and after ordering the Sakurambo suggested by my server the evening proceeded with the clever candy menu paired with rich raspberry sauce before proceeding to palate cleanser of light strawberry sorbet amidst refreshing mint gelatin and then a supplementary course of creamy duck liver brilliantly paired with items sweet, savory, and acidic plus buttery laminated pastry made to order in the open kitchen.   Progressing next to the main course, one of five selections on a frequently changing menu, I can only say that if a picture is worth a thousand words then the combination of presentation and flavor displayed by "Ringo" was exponentially greater, the candy apples hand-blown before me and piped with apple mousse resting besides a perfect apple ladder and creamy honey ice cream made in house.  A beautiful night already in motion long before heading to dinner with friends it will not be long before I return to Sweets Raku and next time it will likely be without plans for afterward so that I can further explore the menu, or at least linger with coffee to accompany the sizable molten chocolate 'mignardise.'

VStill ranking a dessert tasting at Joel Robuchon amongst her favorite meals of all time a visit to Sweets Raku was a foregone conclusion during my mother's visit to Las Vegas and again taking the dessert before dinner approach but this time electing a table as opposed to the counter results would prove no less stellar, a three course tasting of almost entirely new selections as Christmas music played overhead to compliment the fir at the entry and festive, edible menu.  All clean lines, brilliant whites, and lovely service with Jasmine tea for mother and an Illy Americano for myself the meal again began with sorbet and mint gelee, this time mango, and with palates prepped the plates that followed were again equal parts beauty and flavor, both the Mt. Fuji and Angel Cream presented ornately and impossibly light with variant textures throughout, the roasted chestnuts the highlight of the former while a buttery biscuit juxtaposing soft pears anchored the white chocolate winged cream.  Clearly a space never lacking for creativity it really should have come as no surprise that 'mignardises' would prove equally impressive as the rest of the evening but with a duo of options again presented with great attention to detail I will simply say that while the chocolate fondant cake sampled on my first visit was again excellent I would strongly suggest making a request for the parmesan cheesecake, a savory riff on the classic rivaling the works of Shawn Gawle's Tarte at Saison and Gabriel Kreuther's Cheese Souffle at The Modern for my favorite things done with cheese in 2013.

A surprisingly large space, literally big enough to park a truck, it was an early arrival that assured us use of the large private dining room and with excellent service from both the general manager plus an enthusiastic young waiter it would not be long before our pizzas started to arrive and brought out in three separate courses it was with the signatures that we began, the "limited" Margherita proving cool to the touch and shockingly bland despite both excellent char and chew to the crust while the Cal-Italia proved far superior with a crunchy, toothsome crust more than able to stand up to a bevy  of toppings both sweet and savory, acidic and creamy.  Moving next to the interesting yet overly complicated and entirely too spicy Quail Egg selection it was at last the "3-course" Romana with its cracker crisp crust and well-paired toppings that wowed me most - the central third particularly well done with the rich meatballs nicely balanced by light cream and ample garlic, though the sweet selection was certainly not lacking in contrast or flavor either.  Moving last to a gifted half of the Farmer's Market Pizza, unfortunately overloaded with cinnamon just as the Quail Egg had been with spice, and finally to a trio of desserts where only the delicate pecan turnover would prove either inspired or memorable I think it is safe to say that the key to enjoying a meal at Pizza Rock is to simply embrace the concept and realize that "everything to everyone" and "do one thing and do it well" are very different mantras; the former definitely improved by a group of good people, excellent service, and (at least in this case) fond memories of 80's and 90's rock ballads.

Noting first that each of the pastries are indeed attractively presented while the staff is smiley, pleasant, and efficient even given the area's immense foot traffic it is here that the positives of Corner Cakes end - the old adage about putting 'lipstick on a pig' rarely as true as a $5 dense, cakey, and flaccid almond croissant to start the tasting off poorly and things only to get worse as I progressed to a 'cronut' so oily that it literally could have been wrung out with the excess oil used to fry up another, better version anywhere else in town.  Assuming that perhaps laminated and/or French pastry simply isn't where Corner Cakes shines it was next with half-hearted enthusiasm that I proceeded onward to a duo of actual 'cakes' and while the individual carrot cake was actually quite decent, a dense crumb with plenty of spice to balance sweet buttercream, the red velvet cupcake managed the seemingly impossible feat of being nearly inedible, the cake itself tasteless around a nearly solid chocolate core while the chalky, chilly frosting seemed to be channeling sour cream moreso than cream cheese - the questionable freshness and half-frozen presentation making me wonder whether the cupcake was even baked on premises...and if so, when?

A large, modern space with terrible music but superlative service and a well culled menu as yet lacking desserts it was just after 6:30pm when I arrived and finding the space devoid of other patrons for the first fifteen minutes I spent some time picking my servers brain prior to placing an order and deferring on suggested bugoli in place of personal favorites from his long list of suggestions it would not be long before dinner began; a welcoming trio spanning flavors sharp, spicy, saline, and umami awakening the palate for things to come.  Moving on to plates ordered as more guests arrived and having requested dishes arrive in logical progression it was the fluffy crab pancake that arrived first and laced with peppers the sweetness of the crab proved an adequate foil, a touch of soy bringing flavors to a point and transitioning well into the sweet, sticky wings - undoubtedly the plate of the evening and something I'd love to see the restaurant adopt in whole bird form once business picks up, though a subsequent course of crispy pork belly served with simply pickled vegetables was nearly as impressive...particularly with crispy glutenous rice cakes in thick, smoky 'ketchup' riding shotgun.

Featuring both classic and novel flavors with all natural ingredients, no artificial colors, and a slow churning process that allows for exemplary density and mouth feel each and every sample tasted was a spot on representation of its signature ingredients, the Pear and Gorgonzola and Olive Oil Rosemary truly savory and subtly swet while the fior de latte was one of the most impressive 'pure' flavors I've ever had the opportunity to taste.  Opting for 3 flavors at a mere $6 and sticking to similar flavors harkening breakfast at a great bakery my duo of cinnamon roll and bombolini were similar but distinct, the later with a subtle yeastiness and slightly sweeter than the former, while the extracted white coffee bean flavor was every bit on par with some of the best in the nation, gelato or ice cream, of which a few of us have tried more than a few.

Not exactly the sort of place one stumbles upon but warm and cheery with local art available for purchase on the walls the menu of Divine Eatery is divided into breakfast/lunch sections for those arriving from 7a-2p with dinner commencing at five o'clock and with both staples and novelties available my order veered towards breakfast - a three part order mistakenly turning into four when my server seemingly read my mind and ordered dessert for me even though I'd not requested it.  Surprisingly soon to swell in patronage as the clock struck 7:30 and reaching perhaps 2/3 capacity by eight it was with several cups of Seattle's Fonte coffee and the restaurant's 80s soundtrack that I passed time until my breakfast arrived and citing Divine's reluctance to stock artificial sweetener "to focus on natural, unprocessed" food I have to say I was a bit let down as all options arrived with artificial maple syrup while the $5 Red Velvet short-stack tasted not only processed but chalky as well.  Turning my attention to the items that worked, both the scratch made buttermilk biscuit and crispy French Toast serving as a sort of crust to a topping of pecan pie proved remarkable while my freebie dessert - not at all natural or unprocessed - was exactly what you'd expect, the strawberry jus sopped up into the light batter of the Twinkie rousing thoughts of the pending summer and shortcake.

VItems Selected:\u000aBlack Seasame Snow, Mochi, Condensed Milk, Egg Pudding\u000aGreen Tea Snow, Red Bean, Condensed Milk\u000a\u000aOriginally intrigued but inevitably underwhelmed by the Fro-Yo fad it was with high expectations that I approached the highly praised Snowflake Shavery hoping that the new 'foodie' trend of Japanese Snow Cream would succeed where others had failed, namely creating a reason to ever crave it in a world full of gelato and ice cream.  Located, like many wonderful things, on Spring Mountain Road in the same complex as Kabuto, Raku, Monta, Zen, and others it was just after 5:00 when I entered the small shop and greeted by friendly servers and low prices I opted for two small "Cool Combos" and with the all-natural 'snow' shaved and topped I made my towards the door to indulge, the delicate ribbons slowly shifting as I walked and the first fluffy bite crossing my lips just as I stepped outside, the flavor quite subtle and decidedly improved by the accoutrements, particularly the egg pudding which I would gladly eat by the bowl topped with or without a scoop of red bean.  Admittedly a fan of sweet, decadent desserts and perhaps expecting too much based on the publicity I will simply say that while I appreciate Snowflake's ethics and ingredients I'm just not their target market - if I want health food I'll stay home and eat as I always do and if I want frozen desserts I'll head over to Art of Flavors.

As much an event as a meal it was mere moments after our party was seated that the education began and kicking off the afternoon with rich steamed-to-order hot chocolate each item to follow would prove superior in both ingredients and in skill, the salads complex and balanced while every item from the oven featured a smoky note of char overlying supple, leavened crust with great chew and a sloppy center.  Admittedly a special event from the opening bites to the off-menu dessert pies and Art of Flavors superlative gelato I can only speak to my experience with Chef Marc manning the ovens, but dollar for dollar I've yet to find a better pizza in Las Vegas and while that search will undoubtedly go on and potentially uncover one better I'd be truly shocked if it comes from a more humble and dedicated man.

Featuring friendly service and owners more than happy to discuss their craft plus a pre-order system that guarantees one can arrive to truly fresh doughnuts it was just after 7:00am on a Friday when I entered the store and having used the aforementioned system my order was ready to go along with a complimentary yeasted donut with sprinkles and three donut holes piping hot from the fryer.  Using oldworld recipes for their cake donuts my first tastes were the buttermilk bar and the Strawberry old fashioned and with both featuring a dense crumb and glaze that is surprisingly subtle I was excited to next see what the fritter had to offer - a great exterior crunch and supple center, though somewhat sparse in apples.  With the raised donut very traditional with light yeasty notes and the blueberry far more naturally flavored than most as I proceeded to the finale I will simply say that although these ladies may not have invented the cronut they have perfected it with crispy layers shattering to the tooth and a light, airy interior far superior to those at Dominique Ansel without the two hour wait, at 3/5 the price, and in no less than 18 varieties if you order in advance.

Completely revamped and redesigned from "First Food" with clever flourishes befitting the Chef's roots throughout it was with the space fully reserved and full of energy that we arrived and after a brief wait in the bar a banquet built for six would serves as our seats for the next three hours - time that seemed to fly by under the care of a professional captain working alongside an enthusiastic back-server named Patrick, both who provided stellar recommendations pertaining to both the menu and local dining in general from start to end.  Speaking next to the food and beginning first with appetizers including a crisp, flatbread pizza with a touch of char and excellent acidity beneath the smooth mozzarella it was actually that the carbonara stole the show amongst the small plates as the tender noodles provided a toothsome backdrop to smoky smoothness while peas and pancetta added a one-two punch of sweet and savory reigning the dish back from being 'too rich' or one-dimensional in the least.  Continually tempted by the excellent focaccia it was not long after the appetizers had been cleared that main courses arrived and selecting largely based on Italian-American classics the trio that arrived along with a rich bowl of perfectly sticky polenta was anything but subtle, the enormous portions and big flavors all the result of family recipes and excellent ingredients - the Lasagna one of the best I've ever had while the chicken parm and Sunday gravy were relatively standard fare save for the gamey and supple slow cooked lamb, every bit of which was enjoyed with focaccia dipped in the sauce as the rigatoni was a bit past al dente for my tastes.  Moving last to desserts, a quartet ordered even as my fellow diners were throwing in the towel, suffice it to say that amongst my few steadfast dining rules is that I never leave a good dessert on the table...and when we walked out those plates were empty, the lightly boozy rum cake alone worth the price of entry and more than enough to get me excited for the opening of Carlo's Bakery in 2014.

Open seven days a week from breakfast till lunch and already a downtown darling with critics, city hall, and Zappos affiliates it was on a lazy Sunday that a friend and I sat down to a table in the airy, charming space just after 8:15 and with on-point service highly praiseful of both Chef Church and owner Ben Sabouri's vision much of what followed would prove well worth the hyperbole, a total of seven items and nearly as many cups of coffee comprising our 90 minute stay.  A menu broad in sections yet well-culled in scope it was with a wide swath that we cut through the options and requesting that items be sent out individually as the kitchen felt fit it was from sweet to savory that the morning progressed, an early offering of doughnuts that came off a touch oily and the doughy bread of the 'Fat Elvis' minor disappointments more than offset by fluffy vegan pancakes, creamy brie on lightly sweetened brioche, and superlative proteins such as the fried chicken smothered in béchamel or the tender turkey burger atop savory bread pudding alongside signature "mashed browns," a crunchy/creamy juxtaposition of butter, brine, and starch.  Off to a good start and informed by our server that the new menu is scheduled to debut in just a few weeks I look forward to seeing how MTO evolves over time - early marketing tactics aside this is a spot with 'destination breakfast' potential and along with 'eat' already a reason for suburbanites and tourists to make their way downtown before dusk.

Featuring all the standards of a certified parlor, inclusive of a hand pressed di Sorrento brick oven, all wood firing, and imported flour worked by hand it was perhaps with a bit of gluttony that a the decision was made to sample four of the restaurant's four signature pies plus the weekly special but in the end each and every one was an individually shaped, lightly charred, bubbly and balanced success.  Truly a space where the concept of quality ingredients and time honored techniques yield a superior product it was with two golden, creamy arancini that the meal began and then progressing through pizza both red and white, simple and complex it was perhaps most telling that the best slices of the day belonged to the Margherita DOC with a the Buffala Mozz briny funk finding harmony in the hand crushed tomatoes yet not to be outdone the eponymous Settebello also shined as the novel pine nuts and mushrooms added an earthen undertone to the pairing of cured meats.  Truly a place where not a single savory was anything less than excellent it was without hesitation that desserts were selected and again choosing broadly the rewards were myriad; a creamy budino on par with DOCG's for best in town a clear favorite amongst many while the Bella Mela proved just as well conceptualized as the pizzas though ever more subtle - a characteristic ignored by both the Calzone and Zeppole; the first harkening a campfire's smoke and the second soft and supple but both filled to bursting chocolate decadence and all the better for it.

Without a doubt the most trendy doughnuttery in town it was with some restraint that I opted for a half-dozen +1 and at a $10 tally the majority of selections were saved for NFL game time snacking, the exceptions being a still-warm $2.25 take on Dominique Ansel's 'Cronut' that unfortunately proved oily, flaccid, and uninspired plus the cocoa-laden pink velvet whose hefty chocolate notes found needed levity in rich, though overly sweet, cream cheese.  Moving onward to the rest, much like other quirky "Voodoo inspired" shops across the country standards like the blueberry cake and buttermilk bar proved above average while novelties stole the spotlight, each filled option featuring natural ingredients and both the banana pudding and key lime gel spot-on representations of the iconic pie fillings inside a fluffy leavened pocket.  A mixed experience to be sure and a prime example of why places of its ilk rarely appeal to purists I personally look forward to seeing how the company evolves over time...hopefully a bit less cronut/bacon/cereal 'me too' in favor of more ambitious 'outside the box' thinking a la the Nutty Pig, Salted Caramel Twist, and Cream pies.

VPistachio Latte\u000aGarlic Honey Toast\u000aHoney Toast\u000a\u000aWith Las Vegas undergoing their independent coffee shop renaissance a few years after most major cities it is perhaps a testament to the local Asian cultures that one of the more well received new locations has been Serenade, a Korean Coffee locale situated in the Southwest featuring a well culled menu of drinks and lattes alongside a small pastry menu and particularly well regarded Honey Toast, the latter of which was to be the focus of an 8am Saturday morning visit along with the oft raved Pistachio Latte.  Small and stylish with free Wi-Fi and comfortable seating plus a soundtrack that is present but not invasive it was with some irritation that, true to rumor, our arrival was originally met with the restaurant claiming to be unable to make honey toast because they were 'out of bread' while also confirming that none of the pastries were made in-house but in true service recovery mode it was then with some surprise that upon hearing about our reasons for visiting a clerk was dispatched not only to retrieve bread but also to prepare two orders of the item for free - one traditional, one with garlic, and both topped with ice cream plus honey.  Admittedly impressed by such a showing of service though still a bit mystified as to how/why they would allow this issue to be recurrent I must say that overall the latte was serviceable albeit a bit cooler than I'd prefer while both of the honey toasts were quite good, the texture every bit on par with Ichiza and better than Spot while the quality of the bread and ice cream outstripped both.  Perhaps a bit too new to judge I cannot say yet that I'd rush back to Serenade given the distance from my home but at the same time I'd also not hesitate to recommend a visit provided Ray and team straighten out the bread situation as the garlic honey toast is definitely something that needs to be experienced to be appreciated.

Served by Scott as trendy tunes floated overhead amidst a deluge of chandeliers it was to great coffee and friendly service that we were greeted just after the restaurant's 7am opening and seated close to the bar the it was with a simple request that courses were paced out in decadent progression, none less than good and a few truly exemplary over the course of an hour with coffee never less than half-full.  Beginning with a single savory before for moving to sweets, homemade biscuits would prove fluffy yet well-buttered beneath thick spiced gravy and although perhaps an odd pairing with a slice of "The Best" carrot cake, I actually preferred the biscuits as the cake itself was excellent while the frosting was just a bit too sweet.  Moving next to a far better use of the carrot cake batter, cast-iron skilled pancakes with light cream cheese drizzle would prove light and every bit on par with those at MTO Café while the similarly topped Red Velvet stack would prove the best I've had to date with light cocoa tones filling the a fluffy batter bronzed by the griddle.  At this point already impressed but expecting great things from what would follow given Harrington's Crème Brulee French toast at Central it was with a trio that the meal wrapped up and with the waffles truly harkening a crunchy yeasted cinnamon roll it was the nearly molten bread-pudding and complex, custard style French toast impressed most - the later begging for a little umbrella given its island influence and crispy coconut topping juxtaposing creamy cookie butter and bursting berries.

Small in size and well-culled in offerings as nearly every topping, accoutrement, and protein is made in house it was with two friends that I sat down at a long bench amidst the Día de los Muertos décor and ordering lightly with an eye to sharing the meal began simply enough with creamy citrus-meets-spice guacamole and tender, bright ceviche before moving on to a quartet of tacos, the three which I tasted all a study of what high quality ingredients and innovative pairings can do to elevate 'simple' street food to new heights.  Beginning first with the Tinga Poblana, a 1-2 punch of braised pork and spicy chorizo finding balance in light crema plus ample garlic and progressing onward to unctuous mushrooms whose woodsy umami-funk was lent levity by light spice and citrus it would be difficult to decide which was more impressive and yet having experienced goat in a number of forms including upscale Greek at Johnny Monis' Komi and traditional Mexican stew from Chicago's celebrated "Birria Zaragoza" I can say without second thought that the Chivo here is exemplary, the meat easily shredded by fork with a light gaminess on first bite giving way to soft grassy tones quick to meld with acid, sweetness, and just enough onion and cilantro to make flavors pop; more than enough incentive to return for a second look at it and the rest of the menu...plus perhaps some Naked City next door.

VLocated on the top floor of The Hard Rock Café on Las Vegas Boulevard and far more intimate than the larger venues located inside the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino I was lucky enough experience Crosses and JMSN on Friday March 28th, 2014 at Hard Rock Live.  Pairing a small stage and a crowd of perhaps 450 with pitch-perfect acoustics, far less smoke than other concert halls in Vegas, and a great vibe from a crowd clearly present more for the music than the 'scene' Chino's side project and the opening act both put on stellar sets with nearly three hours of music for only $20 - by far the best concert value I've found since relocating to LV.

Empty save for one other table at our 2pm arrival and featuring a diverse menu anchored in rich Portuguese traditions with all stocks, sauces, and spice blends made in house it was with a small amount of experience in the region's cuisine that our quartet perused the options but with staff more than willing to engage, discuss, and suggest despite significant language barriers the seven items selected all proved not only well prepared and presented, but also highly educational and thoroughly enjoyable.  Skipping over seemingly out-of-place pizzas and pastas, though we were assured that these too are common to the cuisine, and focusing instead on the items favored by Luby as well as personal tastes it was with dense, warm milk bread that we began and with plates coursed out one-by-one appetizers commenced with lightly spiced Portuguese chorizo, ablaze on presentation and smoky with a snappy kielbasa-esque flavor, followed by squeaky griddled Halloumi with house-made sweet and sour serving to balance the brine.  Moving next to tender snails in thick garlic cream it was fourth that the primary reason for my visit arrived and living up to high hopes the milk-soaked and shredded preserved cod was perfect as two large cylinders arrived featuring ample salinity balanced by smashed potatoes, eggs, and subdued aromatics to form something rich, rustic, and satisfying...something I routinely seek out elsewhere now done well in my own back yard.  Rounding out the savories with two more richly sauced proteins including snappy squid in bright curry and tender chicken with notes of cumin, paprika, and something citrus perfuming the palate it was with full stomachs that Luby compelled us to order dessert, the tiramisu made by herself that morning, and whether 'traditional' or not I'm uncertain but either way the scoop of light mascarpone and bold coffee was much like the rest of the afternoon - delicious, comfortable, and served with gracious smiles and requests to come back soon, something I've no doubt the bacalao will compel.

VWhether a result of my Midwestern upbringing or my career choice I've always been a bit of a perfectionist and someone who craves authenticity, thus when I heard about a new New Orleans themed Po-Boy shop so dedicated to their craft that breads and proteins were being imported from NOLA I could not wait to go...all I needed was a group, something thankfully facilitated by a cronut-tasting with several like-minded diners earlier that day.  A surprisingly expansive space with festive décor replete with shiny red vinyl booths and a truly splendid paisley carpet it was just prior to 11:30am that our large group arrived but having contacted the restaurant in advance the small team couldn't have been more accommodating, tables rearranged and service perfect throughout our 90 minute stay.  Focused on diversity with an eye towards capacity and thus ordering in groups it was a total of five sandwiches, seven sides, and four desserts that I personally experienced and although I cannot pretend to be a Po-boy 'expert' every single item I tasted was a delight.  Beginning first with all thing fried it was snappy pickles, creamy macaroni, sweet corn, okra, and softly spiced hushpuppies that first landed on our table and with low prices and big flavors there was more than enough to share...or even to make a meal in itself alongside the ample portions of slaw and house-made chips accompanying the sandwiches.  Moving next to the Po-boys, it was with the eponymous "Streetcar" that we started and with surprisingly plump shrimp and oysters full of brine the trend of superlative ingredients spanned right through two soft, spicy takes on boudin plus excellent 'debris-style' roast beef all served "dressed without mayo" on crunchy, lightly yeasted French bread on par or better than any I've found in Las Vegas to date.  Equally impressed by a thickly stacked muffaletta served on its traditional roll with house-made olive spread a bit less briny than I recall down south it was here that we moved from savory to desserts and with many already feeling plenty sweet from the pre-meal cronuts it can only be said that a surprise praline-style King Cake in addition to the fresh made cream cheese standard that we ordered in advance was a gluttonous gift, both cakes every bit as good as I recall from Haydel's and the freshness paying dividends as bright yeasty notes tempered the slowly melting glaze.  Never one to skimp on experience, especially as the owner stopped by to talk shop and express her thanks for our visit, it was with beignets and bread pudding that the afternoon concluded and with the former far less dense and oily than those at Café de Monde, though not quite as rich in flavor, the latter simply stole the show as rich, eggy bread melded with boozy caramel and raisins in a simple coffee cup served still-bubbling hot...homey, authentic, and in my opinion "perfect."

VItems Selected:\u000a\u000aMargherita Slice\u000aGarlic Knot\u000a\u000a...with my opinions on traditional New York "slice shops" varying from terrible to merely decent but having found some improvement in the style since relocating to Las Vegas, largely as a result of superior ingredient quality at both "Secret Pizza" and Pop-Up, it was with cautious optimism that I approached the newly minted Strip-side Pin Up Pizza at pH's Miracle Mile Shops for a late afternoon bite.  Truly a "slice shop" featuring a small counter with standing room only dining both inside and out plus a half-dozen pies served by a staff of four including two servers, a cashier, and a pizzaiolo hand-tossing gargantuan crusts it was to warm smiles and pleasantries that I was greeted and taking my time to peruse the options and inquire what was most fresh an order was placed - a seemingly steep $6.76 after tax, but on closer inspection a price well justified by a baseball sized garlic knot and locally sourced heirloom tomatoes on what I'd argue to be the city's best electric (or gas for that matter) crust, though purists may beg to differ given a lack of "foldability"...or perhaps "fold-necessity" as relates to greasy, flavorless 'tradition.'  Subtle with semolina but largely a lightly yeasted flour base with just enough spring and char to support the ingredient weight from rim to a center approximately one foot away suffice it to say that single slices at Pin Up will eat like a meal to some, but with dollops of fresh mozzarella playing against fresh sliced tomatoes and a drizzle of olive oil on such an impressive backbone with only pre-filled $3 cannolis for dessert I'd say that's just fine...besides, knowing what I know now I rather wish I'd have stuck around to try a slice of the housemade pepperoni with shredded fresh mozzarella and hand crushed tomato sauce instead of schlepping to MGM for dessert anyhow.

Clearly untrained and understaffed to handle a restaurant nearly 3/4 full by 12:30 it was with a trio of appetizers that our meal began and with beverage refills scarce as servers ran in circles perhaps it was fortuitous that none of the first round proved remotely spicy, the hamachi tacos bright and crisp at $3 each while dull, limp wings and the vinegar tinged salad proved entirely forgettable...and not particularly 'Vietnamese' at all.  Moving next to larger scale items, a duo of pho dishes would prove respectable if not particularly well presented; the supple oxtail imbuing long rice noodles with a meaty sapor while an enormous proximal femur laced its broth with fat to balance ample scallions, though heat remained mute even in the presence of sliced jalapenos.  Moving finally to the items that showed the kitchen's promise, suffice it to say that tender pork belly first braised then rendered soft in coconut milk proved by far the most complex option of the afternoon despite its unexpected sweetness and although a seemingly odd choice, the throwback 'get down n' dirty' shrimp finally delivered in the spice department, a pound of the snappy shell-ons again leaving my water-glass empty while wondering why we hadn't just gone to Crab Corner or Hot n' Juicy instead.

Featuring an eclectic menu ranging from $3-$9 with a dozen unique base-sandwiches and options for breads, add-ons, and "Monte Cristo" treatment providing ample room for customization it was after perhaps ten minutes of chatting with Jake about the metal-kiosk's surprising sourcing program (think foie from Artisanal Foods made into terrine by Goodwich staff, or house-made mostarda and spreads) that I placed my order and subsequently taking a seat in raucous Dino's where TV On The Radio and The NHL Network kept me entertained it would be just over 10 minutes before my food arrived, each option truly stunning despite a sub-$20 tab.  Opting for all sandwiches on White (Pain de Mie, actually, harkening Jake and co-owner Josh Clark's fine dining rearing) with two fried-golden the degustation began with the "Foie &" as a thick lacquer of unctuous terrine found balance of both taste and texture in crunchy, salted chicken skin plus slightly sweet stewed cabbage and moving next to "Ham &" a similar concept was presented, but entirely different with tender pork providing the brine as snappy arugula blended with fruity mostarda and aged cheese for big flavor, but a sense of refinement akin to something served on the strip at 4x the $5 price.  Clearly unable to resist dessert in such a setting, particularly when featuring golden bread and Nutella for $3.50 (the 50 cent upcharge for a visit to the fryer), it was with the sweet but subtle "Fluff & Nutt" that my meal concluded and as the soundtrack overhead shifted to Janis Joplin's 'Mercedes Benz,' subsequently joined by nearly every voice in the house, I couldn't help but smile and think about the early days of Cleveland's now-legendary Melt, a business and sourcing model not dissimilar to what The Goodwich is targeting, and one that has now spawned three additional locations.  Defying any thoughts of the 'simple sandwich' I wish the folks all the luck in the world and will undoubtedly be back; a $9 foie gras fix is something not even "Major Cities" have to offer...not to mention anything for $3 using ingredients this good.

VItems Selected:\u000aBlueberry Lemonade\u000aMocha Frappe\u000aStrawberry Smoothie\u000aHoney Toast\u000a\u000aLocated in a nondescript strip mall with a simple black and white banner serving as the only indication of its existence suffice it to say that Café Darak is all the rage with local Yelpers, the Korean-style shop serving up a variety of coffees, teas, frappes, and desserts in a setting conducive to conversation and relaxing amidst shabby-chic furniture, kitsch decor, and even a pop-up canvas Volkswagen bus.  Best described by the term 'precious' with stamp cards hung on the walls and toys delivered with each tray of drinks it was to the sounds of Velvet Underground that we entered the small store and although the only ones placing an order as a few customers lingered to utilize the surprisingly slow Wi-Fi the pace of the service was leisurely at best - three drinks and a dessert necessitating nearly twenty minutes' wait and rousing wonder of what would happen in the case of more business.  Left to rest as Lou Reed rambled overhead when drinks finally arrived expectations were perhaps slightly inflated and although the blueberry lemonade proved both tangy and natural neither the strawberry smoothie nor the mocha frappe were memorable in the least - a subpar blender delivering a crunchy iced experience that could not be sipped through a straw with bland flavors harkening subpar fruits and cheap chocolate sauce, respectively.  Largely unimpressed by the beverages along with the substantial wait it was thankfully in the toast that Darak found a bit of solace as the crunchy bread yielded a pliable center gilded with honey, ice cream, cinnamon and sliced almonds but with the rest of the desserts made elsewhere and the rest of the experience largely lacking I'd be hard pressed to justify a reason to return with two Sambalatte locations serving up a better vibe, larger variety, quality baristas, and a true in-house pastry program without all the twee and time waste.

Well designed and immense in size with clever interior flourishes complimenting the concept of "Twisted Farm Food" it was mere moments after the puck dropped on the third period that I arrived to the hostess stand and after a brief greeting I was handed off to a lovely lady named Peggy who would keep watchful eye over me throughout the overtime-extended visit - the nearly eighty minute stay ample time to enjoy approximately a whole pot of hot coffee and all that arrived on Hash House's enormous signature plates.  Deciding to go one sweet and one savory with a request to deliver the former followed by the latter it was with the special pancake that I arrived and truly the size of the hubcap it was exactly what I expected, fluffy and laced with buttermilk but exceedingly sweet; the equivalent of eating birthday cake for breakfast and exactly the sort of thing I'm willing to go out early for, though probably a dish best shared...particularly given what followed in a Benedict balancing a surfboard of crisp, lean pork with top quality vegetables and creamy mashed potatoes beneath lightly sweetened and tangy barbeque cream.  Perhaps not 'refined' and undoubtedly 'over the top,' yet a place with something for everyone given their dedication to ethical farming and product sourcing Hash House a Go-Go remains one of the rare mini-chains I'm happy to support and with newer locations even offering 'lite' options of simple eggs, toast, proteins, and salads its only a matter of time before I visit the downtown and Sahara locations...the best biscuits in the city just one more highlight on an already long list.

VThey have free WiFi throughout the entire thing and it is completely reliable.  Add in the unique hat shop, huge Flamingos, hilarious tourist watching of green-clad folks stumbling out of O'Shea's, plus Brooklyn Bowl and soon to come "High Roller" and I could see this being the next "must visit" place for friends coming to town.  Not quite sure about the restaurant selections at this point, but I'm sure time will tell the tale - as long as they have free WiFi and plenty of room to wander I know I'll be back.

Expansive in size with diverse seating options flanking a central bar as televisions and memorabilia decorate the walls the TAP experience is truly a sportcentric one as a well-trained staff of jersey-clad severs circulate to the sounds of the game as opposed to some hideous Journey ballad generated via Touchtunes and although both food and beer menus trend small the selections themselves prove both unique and well-culled.  Clearly featuring a West Coast bias amongst its patrons and showing the NHL on every screen it was with a trio of beers and five appetizers that our meal began and with cheese as a theme it was actually the meaty chili in a bowl of buttery cornbread that impressed most and although I'm told the Onion Soup was quite bad both pretzels and herbaceous curds proved competent while man n' cheese bites were surprisingly light and rife with sharp cheddar.  Moving next to main courses after a near-hour lull it was in a quartet of options that we invested and although the open-face sandwich was delivered both dry and cool to the touch while thinly pounded pork proved far inferior to that at Hash-House-a-Go-Go it would be difficult to find fault in either the smoky Sloppy Joe atop one of the city's best buns or the innovative Corned Beef-style short rib with ample spicing and meat literally falling off the bone.  With more beers, more chat, and a Gaborik goal tying the game it was finally in desserts that we indulged and although none of the options are prone to wow on the level of those at Lagasse's Stadium both the Guinness Shake and substantial brownie were plenty rich enough to share while the deep fried s'mores and sidecar of fudge are an indulgent mess well worth making.

Based on the concept of accessible decadence and tucked away in a cozy corner with cute décor it was just past noon when I arrived at Truffles n Bacon and invited to seat myself after self serving the first of several cups of water menus were presented, a thin young man with odd mannerisms butchering pronunciations while more senior servers attended to a private party at the storefront window.  Every bit living up to its café credentials with a crafted menu of soups, salads, sandwiches, and small plates it was with some remorse that I passed over options like the Mac n' Cheese and Bacon Jam spiked sandwiches but focusing first on a duo of appetizers I was immediately free of regret, the small $2 scone a textbook example pocketed with butter and apricots while all three rounds of bruschetta proved bold  and balanced, the saline-sweetness of the haloumi and grape composition particularly enthralling.  Moving next to things more substantial suffice it to say that with housemade preserves gilding the proverbial lily one should pay close attention to the buttery brioche enveloped 'Monte Cristo' whose lack of deep frying renders it particularly light - a matter of particular importance to those with smaller appetites as no one should leave Truffles n Bacon without ordering dessert, the decadent wedge of dark chocolate brownie still molten at its core while two batons of vanilla custard laden bread pudding were treated to a high-temperature sear rendering the exterior caramelized as insides presented hot, jiggly, and amongst the city's very best desserts.

Copiously praised for their haphazard macarons, uglier than most albeit far cheaper, suffice it to say that artificial flavors and colors are the rule at Manon and although the caramel and cherry both offered a crisp break into creamy filling the others were frankly gummy and unappealing even for $1.10.  Moving on to laminated pastry, a tiny bear claw proved neither French nor interesting with a dearth of filling while a pancaked croissant covered for artificial almond tones with too much chocolate and questionable freshness as it was cool to touch even seconds after staff opened the doors.  Taking a cue from a young server for my final selections as they hadn't yet made anything choux it was in butter pastry that I finally found some reprieve for Camille and although I'm rather certain the apples on my tart came from an HFCS-labeled can the lattice itself was lovely, a trend equaled in the base of the decadent flan with sweet eggy tones punctuated by pockets of cocoa and a ribbon of caramel.

Over 80,000 square feet and opening nearly 20 minutes late as staff scrambled and soundcheck overran it must be said that the new Linq locale is beautiful, the dining area, stage, and lanes all up a gleaming escalator and with clever bowling-hip décor used to divide but not occlude each area from the next both the energy and the volume were high, even with the lanes not opened for "unexpected" reasons.  Settling into our seats, five of us in total, and provided the Blue Ribbon crafted menu service was decidedly rough around the edges - dishes misdescribed, crib notes clearly used, tickets incorrect, and delays plus dropped plates common - but with grace and humor plus a good environment most was forgivable...at least for now.  Moving on to food and beverage, a total of four beers and two milkshakes complimented six plates plus two desserts and with the Bourbon Street Shake and Cookie Dough disguised as French Toast "bread pudding" shining brightly amongst the sweets it was the savories that all wowed; 'bar' or 'bowling-alley' food only in spirit.  Beginning first with toasty pizzas featuring immaculate produce over thick toasted bread and moving on to smoked chicken wings so moist as to fall off the bone without a hint of grease it was what followed that most diners will come for, and with good reason.  Considered by some to be the "best" fried chicken they've ever tasted an 8 piece mixed plate was ordered and delivered alongside breadcrumb crusted macaroni that could certainly generate similar praise the matzo-crusted, brined bird truly was remarkable - just enough spice and salinity in the golden coat plus a chicharone-esque crunch to each bite bringing the quality of the moist bird to the fore. Already running an impressive kitchen in a venue primed to make a big impact in the local music scene it should only be assumed that service and timing will improve and while the 'best' debates will surely continue I know for a fact this was not my last visit to Brooklyn Bowl - gutter-balls and Black Label Society followed by a Banana Split and Molten Chocolate Brownie anyone?

Originally opened as early as 7am but since trimming its hours to an eleven o'clock start it was just after 1:15 on a Saturday afternoon when my family and I entered the lightly decorated space and without another patron present as Biggie Hypnotize'd us a bit too loudly from overhead the menu was perused - a quintet of items both time-tested and trendy ordered and paid for at the counter even though full table service was provided by the lone waitress/server/busser/hostess from beginning to end.  Beginning first with three Buldogi classics, two all-beef hotdogs and one order of fries, it should go without saying that both the franks and the house-made toppings were excellent and although fries proved a bit limp the combination of garlic and pork proved surprisingly light, the later gracing the briny Gang-nam for a smoky sapor that I only wish would have been present in the watery ham atop the underwhelming, bready, and overcooked Monte Cristo that arrived alongside an equally doughy waffle thankfully rescued by reference standard Korean Fried Chicken, crispy and lacquered with briny soy-caramel - by far the best bite of the afternoon and the best Korean Fried Chicken I've found in town.  Obviously a work in progress and still looking to find its footing amongst the staunch competition of Spring Mountain suffice it to say that sticking to the classics is a safe bet at Buldogi café while wandering to more Americanized novelties is a risk; one Milner and team might better approach by being as creative as they are with the dogs - the pork belly and a quick trip to the deep fryer could do wonders for that sandwich.

VSuffice it to say that I am not an expert on cocktails, lounges, or trendy places to hang out and sip exotic alcohol, but save for the overly loud pianist competently taking and playing requests I really liked the vibe of BLVD in the Linq.  Paying a visit just prior to dinner at Brooklyn Bowl it was to smiling service and a well culled menu of craft cocktails that we arrived and with Bob Dylan and The Beatles played loudly beneath the glowing lightbulb cloud my $14 Cocojito proved excellent - the high top notes of lime and mint giving way to a citrus Bacardi base softened by rich frothed coconut milk.  With friends equally impressed by a classic Manhattan and a spicy jalapeno vodka cocktail there is little doubt this place is prone for success, though a few less decibels would have been ideal for conversation.

Originally seated outside but later transitioning indoors as thumping music and debris from a nearby palm tree made the former unpleasant it should first be said that the interior of the restaurant warrants a look even for those opting for a 'slice' at the Linqside window as design flourishes such as repurposed barstools and lighting are built to wow and moving past expected freshman service mistakes to the meal that transpired, most of it was good - no more and no less.  Beginning with appetizers, expectedly suffering from on-strip pricing much like the pies, a trio of plates arrived after rather forgettable breadsticks and with the meatballs and whole-milk mozzarella ham sandwiches both pleasant enough only the eggplant really shined; the breading harkening panko and the meaty vegetable supple without being oily in the least.  Focusing next on Pizza, one white and two red, a quick look at the crust shows a good char begetting a crisp chew to mixed flours imbued with either semolina or corn, and moving on to ingredients both meats and cheeses shined - a truffled addition to the Carbonara adding great depth to a pie that easily stole the show from overly sugared San Marzanos hampering the simple Margherita and spicy Calabrese.  Passing on desserts based on a complete lack of creativity and the presence of Sprinkles next door it was to the tune of $125 after taxes and tip that we settled the tab and while I'm rarely one to quibble prices suffice it to say there are better pizzas and superior red sauce Italian values to be found throughout the Valley...even on strip I can name at least five.

Friendly in service and large in footprint with ice cream to the right, cupcakes to the left, and the ever popular (and hilariously confusing to Euro-tourists looking for cash) ATM outdoors it was to the tune of $27 that an order of three cakes, four cookies, and a scoop of ice cream...plus several tastes...were procured and taking a wobbly seat beneath the boom of Beyonce followed by Bee-Gee's the indulgence began.  Starting off with a cookie sandwich, crafted carefully with intense caramel ice cream flecked with crunchy salt between two subtly spiced cookies, and then moving to the stunning peanut butter/pretzel amalgam plus a slightly oversalted chocolate chip it was with an early sugar buzz that attention next turned to Sprinkles' mainstays; each of the $4.25 cupcakes featuring a moist yet light base with subtlety serving to balance intense frostings - the triple cinnamon particularly impressive even if it was the Red Velvet that spawned an empire.  Typically favoring a more dense crumb and higher frosting-to-cake ratio suffice it to say that although originally a skeptic I've little doubt that this will not be my last stop at Sprinkles and while still not the best in the city (or even on the strip) both the Carrot Cake and a "Sprinkles Sundae" are calling my name.

VStopped by on Saturday while they were finishing the build-out and offering a few people the chance to see the space, some of the goods, and the process.  Particularly like the open window where you can watch the bakers at work and the passion they seem to be putting into making this space more than just another strip knockoff of a famous place from elsewhere.  While pastries were unfortunately not available to the public during my walkthrough, Buddy was around teaching the team and coaching them on aspects of not only baking, but customer satisfaction in a very hands on way that I found impressive for a 'celebrity chef.'  More impressed than I'd have ever guessed by Buddy V's I'm looking forward to heading back here this weekend for a comprehensive tasting, particularly as the prices don't appear to have suffered the famous strip up-charge, instead harkening the original at Hoboken.

Clever in design and diverse in craft with cakes, cannoli, cookies by the pound and more sold in the Italian tradition of tickets and hand bills Carlo's problems begin at the door where several starry eyed customers forget tickets in the face of photo-ops and proceeding to the counter the issue is multiplied by mislabeled product, the fledgling staff all the more confused with items frequently forgotten by many early reports - in my case a $3 creampuff for which I was charged but never received.  Moving next to the product, prices not substantially different from the east coast flagship but still dramatically inflated given the name on the door, my tasting began with a pair of pre-filled cannolis and with sog already setting in suffice it to say better can be had at Montesano's for half the price, any true Italian realizing filled-to-order is the only way to go.  Admittedly disappointed but moving on to more, a duo of $3.50 cupcakes smaller and far less inspiring than Sprinkles or Bouchon would follow and proceeding to a duo of forgettable cookies I was thankful when three forms of puff pastry finally proved memorable - the fresh-cut Napoleon I'd watched the team layer, frost, and cut in the kitchen a flaky masterpiece and the still-warm cinnamon strudel danish a pastry well worth the five bucks.  Obviously new and clearly capable of sustaining a few bumps in the road on the backs of adoring fans it will be interesting to see just how long Buddy and team can ride the initial wave of hype, but featuring the only legitimate Italian Bakery on the strip I'm sure they'll be around long enough to justify waiting to visit unless one is a true fan - and even then I'd suggest anyone with transportation visit Freed's or Montesano's first.

Owned by Matthias Merges and nothing short of stellar in its Avondale location where service, sourcing, and skills befitting his Michelin starred past found new footing in reinterpreted yakitori, a visit to Yusho at the Monte Carlo begins with the space, a jazzed up version of the original with a long floorplan plus eye-popping colors juxtaposing the gleaming open kitchen and with knowledgeable servers brought in from icons like Savoy and Robuchon without any pomp or pretense the 'experience' unfolds like few others - casually refined and a whole lot of fun, the kitchen and front of house doing each other justice even on day one.  Speaking to the cuisine itself, having already visited the original twice a few selections were made while allowing the kitchen carte blanche otherwise and beginning with pristine oysters each of the eleven courses that followed proved superlative, the signature 2xChicken as good as ever while eggplant, pork shoulder, and crispy duck served with bao all served notice that that Fat Choy is no longer the only game in town.  Surprised by the nutty, acid kissed octopus before being wowed by both the umami-laden wrapped Wagyu and a fluffy okonomiyaki serving up funk and heat tempered by fruit it was finally with a duo of desserts that we concluded and although the softserve remains a worthy staple it was the doughnuts that stole the show, an unexpected lightness from the tofu beneath sophisticated herbal notes and crystallized ginger, just barely sweet.  Admittedly a fan of Chef Merges dating back to a meal partly responsible for stoking my love of fine dining during his tenure at Charlie Trotter's only time will tell whether such a radical departure from the Vegas 'norm' will yield success, but with a great team already in place and a dynamic cocktail menu including several draught options alongside the sort of food this city has not yet seen I know I'll be back soon because whether for drinks, bites, or a full meal Yusho is the sort of restaurant Las Vegas Boulevard needs.

Located on West Russell in one of Spring Valley's several strip malls and officially open 8a-4p seven days a week my arrival at Bachi HLK was greeted by the smell of fresh oranges being squeezed at the room-length open bar and soon finding smiling service from a young man named Brent I was offered my choice of seats - an exquisite experience amongst elegant blonde woods and an open floor plan marred only by slightly-too-loud pop music during my hour long solo visit.   Featuring all all-day menu spanning appetizers and eggs to griddles, sandwiches, and salads it was to a veritable who's who of personal favorites that I found myself tempted and opting for a trio even at the early hour of 8am the meal started with a bang, a creamy 2.5oz torchon of foie gras every bit on par with that at Bouchon but with better bread and house-made jam for $5 less.  Already smiling as I tended to my liver it was at my request that the next plate was fired in the open kitchen and arriving with cheese still bulbbling the HLK take on a Monte Cristo was truly divine as briny bird with a hint of smoke found new light in aged gruyere while supple griddled brioche dusted with powdered sugar provided an eggy canvas for thick jam, some already onboard and more on the side.  At this point sated but curiosity not yet satisfied it was with a bit of indecision that I sorted between pancakes, beignets, banana bread, and chicken on waffles but going with my instincts the final plate of the morning would prove the bet of the trio; a six stack of almond-coated custard rounds rousing the flavors of a pina colada only to be bolstered by a trio of all-natural syrups plus whipped cream and salted butter; the comparison again to Thomas Keller's work on-strip with the "bread pudding style", but Bachi's more subtle and texturally appealing - a strong bit of praise considering the accolades and Michelin Stars garnered by the former.

Large in both size and selection with high ceilings and kitschy cow décor plus a youthful staff already well trained it was just after 1pm that I entered the new BLVD and bearing no relationship to the cocktail bar in The Linq my experience started out with a tasting - no two-spoon limit like that of Sprinkles either, just a smiling face with recommendations comprising nearly half the selections and none but the overly-subtle tres leches less than impressive.  Silky in texture and close to gelato in heft with large single-scoops starting at $4 it was eventually on the horchata-esque rice pudding that I settled and served in a fresh baked compressed-cookie bowl without accoutrements I can confidently say Art of Flavors finally has some creamy frozen competition - a bit of oneupsmanship from the newcomer, even, in the form of two warm cookies on par with the best of Las Vegas Boulevard.  Similarly priced to AoF as well as Sprinkles with a patio adjacent to the new Sambalatte one can only hope that BLVD spurs the same sort of creativity and competition in frozen treats that Due Forni and Settebello brought to reinvent the Las Vegas pizza scene over the last ten years because in a city of two-million with triple digit temperatures and tons of tourists there is a whole lot of space between Monte Carlo and Chef Desyree's spot up north for something cold and creamy.

Every bit the bustling space suggested by its name, with close set tables and traditional heavy woods beneath the sexy glow of globed lighting, it was just after 6:30pm on Saturday when our party was seated and starting off with a stunning riff on the Bee's Knees our menu was confirmed...at least conceptually...though much of what followed was not exactly what was requested and much of it was marred by still-green service.  Setting aside small mistakes on sourcing and pronunciation as well as beverages spilled more than once plus an obvious miscommunication from front of house to back about the menu requested it was with a duo of Boulud's superlative terrines that we began and with the foie gras smooth as silk while the chicken and pork pate upped the ante with an earthy funk one can only hope for this program to expands; a "Bar Boulud" charcuterie program like that in Manhattan's theater district seemingly a perfect choice on The Strip.  Moving next to outsourced bread and salty butter before progressing into the one-two punch of garlicky snails followed by the best scallops I've had in recent memory as the restaurant filled to perhaps 80% capacity it was in our fourth course that things got interesting; the lightly seared lamb and its spicy sausage tender and delicious but served as our "main course" when my request had clearly delineated the duck as a 'must.'  Eventually served the confit after much hemming-and-hawing including the involvement of the Dining Room Manager suffice it to say that the crispy-skinned fowl is absolutely worth visiting (and perhaps fighting) for and finishing the evening with a glut of sweets plus a quintet of award-winning cheeses one can only hope the service can soon keep up with the kitchen...not only does Chef Middleton's cuisine warrant it, but so does the textbook Gateau Basque.

VStopped by after work to take a look around and I have to say I love the concept.  A little too tired to give it a proper taste test today but likely heading back tomorrow or Sunday to further investigate F.A.M.E.'s nightmarket concept is without a doubt something new to The Strip and with skewered meats, dim sum, stir fry, dessert, and even a permanent Fukuburger Truck with late night hours I can definitely see this place serving as a change of pace from the largely corporate offerings of The Linq dining while also serving up some excellent grub for late night revelers not entirely sober enough to drive to Spring Mountain.

Not only new but decidedly nontraditional in its format with several stations encompassing stir-fry, soups, dim-sum, BBQ, Thai, Korean, Chinese Take-Out, and the first stationary Fukuburger it should be expected that F.A.M.E. is not yet firing on all cylinders - Beard Papa, boba, in-house pastry, and Fochun upstairs coming soon - but with full meals unlikely to top $15/pp and hours extending to 2am the concept is already poised to make waves as nearly everything I tasted was quite good. Beginning first with a few bites of chicken - a trio of karaage, 'bourban,' and orange - I was immediately impressed by the crunchy sapor of the first while the last was a touch too sweet and moving next through a basket of juicy shumai my attention turned to the 'truck,' my first Fukuburger moist and rich even before being gilded with a slightly overcooked egg and punchy accoutrements. Rarely impressed by potatoes but finding the crispy 'jazz' fries quite addicting as I chatted with the team about the upcoming "art, music, and entertainment" it was just prior to noon when my final plate arrived and with both duck and pork crispy yet supple beneath a touch of acid-sweet sauce I immediately swooned, a $12 plate worth the drive from Spring Mountain to The Strip as opposed to the other way around.

VLA based lifestyle company in the linq.  Soft opening but so far seems a bit overpriced - like urban outfitters for trust fund kids.
