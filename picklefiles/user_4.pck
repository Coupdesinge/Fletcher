VGot good deals on low back lawn charirs here of all places!?!? We found them by searching high and low by the beach equipment. We asked a worker when we first got in if they had them, and within seconds, his answer was flat out no, rather than helping us find other possible spots where they might be. Yeah, service here kinda sucks...\u000a\u000aThey also carry sporting goods for just about every sport and fitness freak here. and this store is huge. One odd thing is that there seems to be more employees on the floor than there are customers!?!? Don't really know how this place is still open when there are there are much better sporting goods shops in town...ALOHA!!!

VClosest thing to plate lunches in Hawaii....Big Portions, reasonably priced and will keep you coming back for more...I've gone here on occasion and scarfed down TWO plates in one sitting which would leave the cashier in disbelief!!! My Favorites are the Mochiko Chicken'\u000aHawaiian plate of Fridays(Where's the Poi???) And Ross J's Combo plate....Here's a good thing to know-ask for fried rice which is even tastier with your plate lunch than the plain white rice....ALOHA!!!

VNever heard of this place before, and we weren't coming to play golf. We were attending a party for a local up and coming bakery called Cravin' Cake, where they rented out a space in the clubhouse, so that's what I'm reviewing.\u000a\u000aThe area we were in was very spacious with a dance floor, and the breathtaking view of the strip at night was awesome. The staff was also nice and attentive, bussing tables, clearing glasses, and replenishing food throughout the night. The lite bites we had were Bruschetta, Coconut Shrimp, Chicken and Veggie Skewers, and Hummus and Flatbreads. The full bar with Coffee, Tea, Hot Chocolate, and mixed drinks were a nice bonus!\u000a\u000aIf you live in the area, and are looking for a place to hold a party, the Revere Golf Club may be a perfect venue for you.  ALOHA!!!

VI've never found a Vietnamese place that serves up a good Steak and Red Rice like this place we always used to go to in Concord when we lived in Cali. We saw something similar to it on the menu, so we decided to take a chance and we also shared an order of fresh spring rolls and a combination Pho.\u000a\u000aThe steak was kinda disappointing and the rice was okay, but the saving grace for our dinner were the other two items. Their Roasted Chicken with the Red Rice is actually a better option.\u000a\u000aWe are still fans, as the service has always been good, food comes out quickly, and its open 24 hours...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(201/365) "The Search for Steak  and Red Rice"

VHearty is one word to describe the smorgasbord of grindage we had. Not only was the food very tasty, The owners and service staff were so nice and happy to see that non-Columbians were enjoying their cuisine.\u000a\u000aWe were served family style and we enjoyed the following:\u000a\u000aEmpanadas with Chimichurri-Crisp, Flavorful, and a great start to our Columbian feast.\u000a\u000aChicken Skewers with Rice, Beans and Sweet Plantains-Love the combination of sweet and salty, so the beans and plantains complimented the juicy chicken and addicting arroz!\u000a\u000aThe Picada is seriously a Carniwhore's heaven! a plate filled with veggies, Tostones(fried green plantains) Beef, Chicharrones, an interesting vinegary tasting Columbian style sausage, and a blood sausage which had a similar taste to Filipino Dinuguan with rice and stuffed in a sausage casing. \u000a\u000aI personally prefer the Colombian Style Arepa to the more familiar Venezuelan arepa that Viva Las Arepas serves. OMV serves it in a griddled corn cake(your choice of yellow or white corn topped with a generous piece of queso fresco. this again is a nice combo of salty and sweet. YUM!\u000a\u000aAfter a some Pastel de Guayaba, we enjoyed Tres Leches and enjoyed the club like atmosphere at the same time as our dinner which made it kinda difficult to communicate with others in our party, but nonetheless fun and festive. Salsa dancing and the Karaoke stylings of Henry Churches with his rendition of "Bailamos" and "Hero"\u000ahad the crowd hootin' and hollerin'!(If you're still having a brain fart on who Henry Churches is...en espanol= Enrique Iglesias). Big mahalo to Christie, and we'll most definitely be back...ALOHA!!!

VStopped in on a weeknight, and this place was packed wall- to-wall....\u000aAccording to lots of Yelpers, this is the spot for Pho, so of course I Get the Combination Pho, but I also gotta have a rice plate too, so I narrow it down to their roasted chicken plate or their grilled lemongrass chicken.\u000a\u000aThe waiter suggests the lemongrass chicken so I go with that. The wifey orders a Vermicelli bowl asking to substitute grilled chicken instead.\u000a\u000aThe Pho arrives first...Broth is clean and flavorful, noodles just right... overall, good dish. Lemongrass Chicken and Vermicelli Bowl arrive.\u000aThe Lemongrass Chicken obviously has been reheated and the vermicelli bowl has beef, instead of chicken.WTH????\u000a\u000aOne bite and I send the chicken plate back and ask to order something else...THE WAITER NEVER CAME BACK!\u000a\u000aWifey was hungry so she ate the beef in the vermicelli bowl...Just OK, nothing memorable. Pho KIm Long is still my go to spot with their combination Pho and Roasted Chicken with Seasoned Rice, a winning combination, IMO.....ALOHA!!!

We grubbed on our usual favorites...Buta Kimchi, Beef tongue, Butter Corn, Grilled Squid, Tempura Fishcake with Cheese and Bacon Wrapped Mochi. Just as tasty as I remember!\u000a\u000aWe also tried the Battera Mackerel, Uni and Squid Roll with Natto, and Beef Liver Chicken Gizzards, and Shishito Peppers which were all okay. We were pretty stuffed but we still had room for dessert....Honey Toast, right??? WRONG!  Overrated....Instead, we drove to La Flor De Michoacan which was close by, and a much better dessert choice...ALOHA!!!

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(110/365) "Best Tongue in Town!"\u000a\u000aAfter being disappointed at Izakaya Cokokala, we came straight over to Ichiza. All of our favorites that we usually order have been deliciously consistent through the years.\u000a\u000aIt is always crowded when we come here and there's usually a wait which is a good sign, we were fortunate to snag seats up at the kitchen counter just after 15 minutes.\u000aPerusing the evening's specials, I was so happy to see Steamed Ankimo(Monkfish Liver...:9) with Ponzu, so I just had to get an order. We also shared our usuals-Buta Kimchi, Tom Yum Roll, Tempura Fishcake with Cheese, Bacon Wrapped Mochi, and some of the best Grilled Beef Tongue in town!\u000a\u000aWe were definitely pleased with "Plan B" and Ichiza continues to be one of my go to spots in town.

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(168/365) "Late Night Bite"\u000a\u000a\u000aSo we had family come in to town recently, and they always enjoy going on restaurant\u000aadventures in Vegas, especially to places they don't have in their neck of the woods(They're from Chico, CA)\u000a\u000aSmall bites and variety is what I was thinking, and since they were flying in late, Ichiza came to mind, so I made a reservation.We headed straight here from the airport to a packed restaurant, but luckily didn't have to wait. Trusting me with the items to order, I had them try our favorites- Grilled Beef Tongue, Tom Yum Roll, Buta Kimchi, Takana Fried Rice, Uni Ponzu, Grilled Mackerel, Grilled Squid, and Bacon Wrapped Mochi.\u000a\u000aThe men decided to wash all that goodness down with a pitcher of Kirin on tap, and the ladies opted for their refreshing Grapefruit Soju. Plates were clean, everyone was stuffed, but we still had room for some Coffee Jello and Honey Toast. Still one of my favorite late night spots.

VAnother Asian bakery among many in the Chinatown area, we stopped in and checked out Diamond Bakery's offerings...Cakes and pastries fill the display cases and more sweets and savory items line the back shelves. decided to try a curry beef puff, portuguese egg tart, and another cream filled stick pastry. My favorite was the tart out of the three. The curry puff was a bit dry, and the cream filled pastry was okay.\u000a\u000aI also saw their version of Manapua(Steamed BBQ Pork Bun) But after seeing a Hawaiian lady buy one and take a bite, I saw a look of disappointment in her face....no sale.\u000aI still prefer the taste of European style baked goods,though  because of the quality of ingredients used as well. By tasting the pastries offered here, I can tell it is not the best ingredients used, and when you cut costs to by a less expensive ingredient, the quality goes downhill....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(151/365) "Sweet and Savory Snax"

VLocated on Commerce street, this is where the majority of culinary workers go to sign up for their benefits. Lately with all of the Obamacare hoopla, We visited the Culinary Union this past weekend to re-register for our benefits in order to weed out frauds and people who have been abusing the benefits by having people under their coverage who weren't even family!?\u000a\u000aBecause of the small size of the building and the 55,000+ members in the union, people had to endure at least a three hour process...one hour out in the cold, another hour and a half in the warming tent, and the last 30 minutes to get all the paperwork squared away. The workers were quick, efficient, and courteous.\u000a\u000aThis past Monday and Tuesday, people endured a 6 hour wait, so times may vary depending on how many people plan to show up. Also, check their website as the deadline has been extended and there will also be longer hours.  ALOHA!!!

Both were pretty solid and tons better then your "chain" establishments.

VClosest thing to home is RIGHT! Russell and Gina have been doing it up serving "ono kau kau" for 18 years in their tiny little strip-mall location on West Sahara...\u000a\u000aSo mom, pops, and my lil' bro were in town, and mom and pops also raved about their wonderful trip to South Korea and how much they enjoyed their experience, she hands me an article on Island style that she got from the flight from Honolulu to Vegas. So after a quick visit to Greenland Market, we drove down to the Sahara location.\u000a\u000aUpon entering, we are greeted by Russell saying "Finally! Customers!"\u000afinding out we were also locals from Hawaii, the more enthusiastic he got, and treated us like we all were ohana, then the pidgin(Island style talk) starts flowing.\u000a\u000a"Come, come" Russell says, seating us in the center of the dining room"take dis' big table right here, plenny room" while there were four of us, this space easily fit 8-10 people.  Then the ono grindz start coming- Boiled Peanuts, Kimchi, Bean Sprouts......Have you ever had a particular food "flashback"??? Well, for me just the smell and the flavor of the boiled peanuts took me way back to my first job which was at a local fishmarket where we prepared various types of poke, lau lau, kalua pig, lomi salmon, pasteles, and of course boiled peanuts. I practically ate the whole container myself(Oooops!)\u000a\u000aso we haven't even ordered yet, but he comes out with a plate of tofu with fresh grated ginger and green onions..."Jus' throw some shoyu on that, das da winnah!"( Local style meaning "thats the bomb", "off the hook" "thats the shiizznit"...Catch my drift?)\u000a\u000aSo we finally get to ordering. Me and my bro order their popular Combo Plate while mom gets the Stone Pot Bibimbap, and Pop \u000asurprises Russell with his order of Fish Jun...."Ho, how you know dat???"Pops replies"you can only get this back home"\u000a\u000aafter talking story with Russell for a good 15 minutes more, Our orders arrive and we start chowing down. No complaints about any of the food or the service here. this is a prime example of good food done right. They buy the best ingredients possible, even if it has to come from Hawaii, and they never deviate from tradition or technique which has allowed them to continue for the past 18 years.\u000a\u000aOn top of our huge orders, a plate of fried mandoo comes out, as well as soup(Okuhara's Saimin Base, Russell confirmed). Boy were we stuffed, but seriously, if you're looking for good local style or Korean food, Island Siyle is DA WINNAH!!! ALOHA!!!!

VSo Mom and Pops were in town again and of course, we hit up Island Style. Russell says "Good to see you folks again"\u000a\u000aIts so hard when you have a favorite item, but you want to try something different on Island Style's menu at least for me it was.\u000aso after browsing the menu, I thought I was planning to try something other than the combo.....\u000a\u000aRussell comes over and takes our order- " Okay, what can I get for you aunty?"(mom) of couse she orders her usual bibimbap...\u000a\u000a"For you uncle?"(pops) "What, Fish Jun?"- "Correct! pops says"\u000a\u000aMy wife(AKA "sista") orders her usual, Meat Jun\u000a\u000aNow its my turn..."and you bruddah?"...Short pause.....\u000aMy minds saying one thing, but like a Jedi mind trick, Russell repeatedly says combo, combo, combo,  so I naturally say combo!\u000a\u000aAs always great food, great service and We'll definitely be back!\u000a\u000a***DON'T FORGET!!!****\u000a\u000aSTEPPIN' OUT ON SAHARA UYE\u000aWednesday, September 8\u000a4:30-8pm\u000aChow down at Island Style, then head down to Herbs and Rye for Happy Hour!!!\u000a\u000aClick on the events link and RSVP....See you there!!!

VGreat turnout for the UYE Event consisting of fellow Yelpers and co-workers...got to even meet some new faces.\u000a\u000aEveryone seemed happy with what they ordered and even Russell's wife came down and made her tofu-kimchi soup...\u000a\u000aI still give Island Style 5 stars even though they accidentally forgot my order\u000a(I ordered my other favorite, the Stone-Pot Bibimbap) They felt so bad, but I really didn't mind because my goal was to "share the love" of Island Style to those who have never dined here.\u000a\u000aRussell and Gina couldn't stop apologizing, and they even bombarded me with tofu kimchi soup, clear broth, and an order of potstickers on top of my bibimbap. He even didn't let me pay for my food, but was very gracious of the gang coming in and feasting on some local grub.\u000a\u000aThanks again Russell and Gina! We'll definitely be back...ALOHA!!!

Not a single penny...\u000a\u000aThey use certified parts, not the generic cheap stuff...\u000a\u000aPrices here are reasonable and they don't charge an arm, leg and a stomach like most places will.\u000a\u000aTheir drivers even offer to take you anywhere you need to go if its gonna be a while to have your vehicle fixed.

VFinally Got to try this donut shop....and its awesome! I love the old school donut shop vibe they have inside, 2/3 of their selection are vegan donuts and its your typical mom and pop type operation can't go wrong with the prices and they keep that old school tradition by packing your order in the very familiar pink donut box. my faves are the cream filled, and the apple fritter..oh, can't forget the twist glazed too:)      ALOHA!!!

I asked Ronald....."Just choose" he says...\u000a\u000aSo I end up getting a couple of twist glazed, boston cream, apple fritter, old fashion, and Ronald suggests a maple bar.

VA few of us were meeting up for Terri R.'s 2014 Donut Crawl-East to West, and Sunrise Too Donuts was my donut shop to hit up.\u000a\u000aThey are located in a tiny little strip mall on E Charleston, betweem a Llantera(Tire Shop) and La Flor De Michoacan Ice Cream Shop. Donut prices vary from $.85 for a cake style donut to $1.25 for filled variations. This is the only donut shop that I noticed carried two different sizes on the cake, yeast raised and crumb versions. \u000a\u000aWe chose an Apple Fritter, Chocolate Glazed Bavarian Cream Filled, Crumb, Twist Glazed, Buttermilk Bar, and substituted a Chocolate Glazed Old Fashioned. and a Maple Bar since there were no Sour Cream or Blueberry Cake donuts available. The lady behind the counter was very nice and helpful with putting our box of goodies together, and we were in and out in no time.As always, come early for the best selections, and no plastic...CASH ONLY!!!   ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter: \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu  3.75\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(7/365) "Sugar Rush at Sunrise Too!"

VBeen coming here since 2004...Truly a landmark in Vegas and perhaps the best frozen custard on the west coast. The owner's name is Greg Tiedmann, who day in and day out churns all of this goodness and also serves it to you NOW 7 DAYS A WEEK from 1pm to 10pm or until he runs out, which has happened on occasion, especially during the summer months. Mad props to this man because he's his own boss, and every year, he closes up shop from the third week of December to just after the new year to enjoy the Holidays and some well deserved vacation time with the family. A dumbass writer for Las Vegas Weekly magazine ran an article about the best frozen custard in Vegas, comparing Luv-it to Sheridan's(Nielsens wasn't even mentioned) and asked "What do you think about the rivalry between you and the other business?" Greg simply said "I wasn't even aware of one." He also had another location for a brief time in the Green Valley area, but "investors" tried to take his business in "another direction" and he simply said "screw you."Why fix something that ain't even broke????? He knows what he's doing, Luv-it has been there since 1973, and he knows he's got a good product, which is why people from all over the world come to Luv-It.\u000a\u000aHe always has vanilla and chocolate churned daily along with 2, sometimes 3 more flavors.posted daily on his website and at the walk up window. Disregard the flavor selections on the right side of the building. My favorite flavor is his Blueberry which is made only once a month. His seasonal flavors are KILLER...Apple Spice tastes like Apple Jacks, Orange tastes like Creamsicle, Malt Creme tastes like Whoppers and His Holiday flavors-Pumpkin, Eggnog, and Peppermint are AWESOME! For those of you who like chips in your ice cream, like mint chocolate chip, be warned that he mean chocolate jimmies/sprinkles, so any of his flavors that have the word"chip" in it are NOT CHOCOLATE CHIPS. What also helps is if you're undecided in what flavor to get, simply ask for a taste.\u000a\u000aHere are some helpful things to know before going:\u000a\u000aLuv-it is located at Las Vegas Blvd. and Oakey St. next to Olympic Garden\u000a\u000aBRING CASH- hes an ALL CASH Business\u000a\u000aIt is a WALK UP WINDOW- be prepared to stand in line, especially on busy summer nights\u000a\u000aLuv-It is a LAS VEGAS LANDMARK and has been for 36 years, yes it is a hole-in the-wall, but thats where you find the best stuff, and if you're sketchy on the location, you're better off driving elsewhere. Oh and those of you more concerned about ambiance you ain't getting it here...there are no tables or chairs, so stop your whining and do like the locals do and either go back to your car and enjoy your frozen custard, or eat standing up ,thats what you have feet for!

VLong overdue for more Luv, A bunch of us Yelp-izzles got together for Angela H.'s Haterade UYE on Valentine's evening. Even The Yangs, Misti and Bobby dropped by for some Luv-It action and were even nice enough to hand out heart-shaped boxes of chocolates!\u000a\u000aFlavors of the evening were Vanilla, Chocolate, and Raspberry. Unfortunately, they had run out of Malt Cream:( I couldn't decide on what flavor to get, so I did the most sensible thing- all 3 flavors!\u000a\u000aAwesome custard, Awesome people, Awesome times......ALOHA!!!

VBest tacos in town by far.....Carne asada grilled on an open flame, not a flat top grill, these tacos are DOUBLE the size of  all the other taquerias around town, so you'd probably fill up after just two tacos. Whole beans, not refried, cheese melted between your tortillas, so you're actually getting a quesadilla and a taco rolled into one....It's always better with all the extras(guacamole, sour cream, cheese) However, if you get the lengua, its best enjoyed simply with onions, cilantro, salt , and a squeeze of lime. They also have seafood cocktails that are to die for, full with oysters, shrimp, and octopus...There is no alcohol here, but their Agua Frescas are the BOMB! My favorite is their mango, and it ain't from concentrate! give them a try and you won't be dissappointed....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000a*Also Check out their new Sahara location!

VBack in 2010, Yelp Las Vegas was just gettin' started and The Trifecta Gallery in The Arts Factory was the venue of my first Elite event. I wasn't even Elite status yet, and knew no one but Misti was nice enough to invite me and my wifey to see how the Vegas Elites get down!\u000a\u000aFast forward a couple of years later, tons of new artwork, shops, and exhibits to check out. Aside from all the art galleries, there is a drop-in yoga studio, you could take guitar lessons and art classes here, and even pick up comics, graffiti supplies, and sweet vinyl toys here.\u000a\u000aWe first stopped inside The Trifecta Gallery next to the yoga studio and the lady running the gallery and her jack russel terrier greeted us at the door and was very informative in explaining\u000avarious displays, who the artist was, and a little backstory to the artist and his/her artwork.\u000a\u000aOne very eye-catching piece was a beautiful tapestry of the Las Vegas Strip(Circa 2007)  done by an artist who went by the name SOLA(Alone in Spanish). It took about 8,000 hours over the span of 3 years to complete using recycled sweaters of Las Vegas residents emphasizing the community focus of her work. Literally living out of her rolling suitcase, she travels from city to city setting up in pop-up studios and purchasing furnishings from thrift stores and gives them back when she leaves. The leftover material is turned into knit hats which generate income that SOLA lives off of. As soon as a donor is found, this tapestry will be hung up in City Hall. Her 40 tapestries can be seen in 10 cities and are absolutely beautiful!\u000a\u000aWe went upstairs and also got to chat with other local artists while creating their latest masterpieces. We also got to see a work in progress of a beautiful colorful Tibetan sand painting\u000awhich takes an eye for detail and a VERY steady hand.(Sorry, no photos allowed for this one...gotta check it out yourself!)\u000a\u000aA great place to see what else is going on in our community, stop by if you're ever in the area, you'll be glad you did!...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(221/365) " Mixed Media"

VTotally legit Southern fare! Step into this market, and head to the back and stand in line with everyone else to feast on some of THE TASTIEST fried Catfish in town! I stand by fellow Yelpers Nelson S., B.K., and Eman S. and their praises for this hidden gem!\u000a\u000aYes, we're not from around these parts as we (more Wifey) stuck out like a sore thumb\u000aif ya know what I mean! I was on a mission for the much-talked-about Fried Catfish and they do it up RIGHT! I'd give 5 stars alone for that!!! Add in Cherry or Grape Kool-Aid on tap, some Mac and Cheese, and Peach Cobbler for dessert and you've got yourself a Southern feast for two! It kinda even felt like we were in the South where everyone knew each other, and the workers were even nice!\u000a\u000aOrder up, go up to the front to pay, then come back to dine on one of the three tables they have is how its done, we ordered, ate, then paid and the cashier was all giggles when we brought up our empty containers to pay!(rookies!) A lady was also laughing in enjoyment as I enjoyed every bite of crispy Catfish with hot sauce...I was bobbin' my head in a catfish zone and she confirmed that it is THE BEST you're gonna get! Mac and Cheese and Peach Cobbler were also comforting, and their sides change up once in a while. \u000a\u000aCan't wait to come back for more!!!   ALOHA!!!

VI've been slacking on reviews, so this ones gonna be a "two visits in one" kind of review....\u000a\u000aActually, we've been here waaay back in 2004 when we first arrived in Vegas.\u000aThe interior has changed, and unfortunately the owners too\u000a\u000aWe returned to this place after craving Thai food. A waitress who goes by the name "pooh bear"(she says pooh means crab in Thai, probably spelled differently) was so nice and personable and pursuaded us to try her favorite(and now one of ours) dish, Lone Some Trout, Deep fried boneless trout over green apple, lettuce, and chiles with a Thai style dressing\u000aONOLICIOUS!!!!!.....\u000a\u000aWe also got their Chicken Satay, Pad Thai, Green chicken curry level 2,\u000aand their Pineapple fried rice.\u000aSatay and Pad thai were great, as was the fried rice and curry. the rice has a nice smokiness to it and is full of chicken, shrimp, pineapples, and cashews-YUMMY! We got spice level 2 for the curry, but we were still huffing and puffing from the heat! Hurts so good! Luckily they also serve bomb Thai Iced tea and VERY REFRESHING water infused with apples, citrus, and assorted berries.\u000a\u000aWe never leave without dessert here. Our favorites are the sticky rice with coconut ice cream, and the Roti(aka Thai Tortilla) with condensed milk.\u000a\u000a Future spot for a UYE???.....Anyone interested?????ALOHA!!!!!!!!

VRecently visited Thai Grill which has again changed ownership. We ordered a couple of our usuals, Tom Kha, and Lone Some Trout. I also wanted to try something different. Their Larb Dish seemed interesting, so I ordered that as well. The new Chef, Natta seemed kinda hesitant to serve the Larb raw(the menu offers the beef raw or cooked) so I ordered it rare.\u000a\u000aThe Tom Kha was very good and just as good as our previous visits, but the Lone Some Trout this time had alot of apples,green and red, and just a few pieces of lettuce. The pieces of trout were bigger, but I wished that it was a little more crispier. The Larb was pretty tasty as well. I loved the balance of herbs and spices and the crispy bits of garlic.\u000a\u000aTo end our meal, we went with the sticky rice and mango-YUM!\u000aThe new Thai Grill definitely deserves a return visit, but I do miss the fruit infused water......ALOHA!!!

This visit, we went with some Papaya Salad, \u000aChicken Panang Curry and of course, Pad Thai.\u000a\u000aPortions here are VERY generous, these three dishes could've easily fed 4-6 people! The Papaya Salad was crisp, refreshing, and had well balanced flavors.\u000aThe Panang Curry was also good with just the right amount of heat(we ordered mild) The Pad Thai was perfection, and just as good as Komol's version and we were stuffed, but still had half of each dish for leftovers the next day.\u000a\u000aThai Grill is back in our rotation, and I'm glad they're not too far from us...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(189/365) "Thai Hiatus"

VDolce has been going here since we got him at 4 months old. Their services offered here are great. The doctors are awesome at keeping up with vaccinations, check-ups, etc.\u000a\u000aThe groomers on the other hand....I guess they do a great job, but for us, grooming Dolce here once was enough. Those of you who have met our little fur ball (He is a cream colored Pomeranian) know that Pomeranians have that specific shape, but our Pom ran out of the room looking like a HUSKY!?!?!? Takes a lot to p**s me off, and this was one of those moments,(4 years ago) but thank goodness his coat grew back into our little wookie...whew!!!\u000a\u000aBoarding Dolce here hasn't been a problem either. When Mama and Papa go out of town, American Pet Hospital has some of the cheapest rates in town, and Dolce gets great attention and care from the staff.  ALOHA!!!

VLove that this location is in our area and is your one stop shop for just about any food need you may have. I'm also a big fan of the free coffee samples they always have too.\u000a\u000aI was planning to make Tiramisu for Vanessa N.'s surprise Birthday, so I grabbed a few tubs of Mascarpone Cheese ($2.99/4oz. tub) and some TJ Cocoa Powder($2.50)\u000aI asked a worker where their Ladyfingers were, and she informed me that it was a seasonal item and that they only carry them during the holidays-CRAP!\u000a\u000a\u000aPanic soon turned to relief as soon as I realized Parma was close by...Whew!   ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(55/100) "Everything But The Ladyfingers"

VNever had Detroit style pizza before, so we checked out NN...Pretty good pizza, and I love the taste of the crust,,,The pizza doesn't  get soggy, and the toppings are just the right amount.\u000a\u000aTheir wings are pretty good too...we got them to go, and when we got home to enjoy them, they were still very crispy...Neapolitan, Roman, New York, Chicago, or Detroit\u000astyle, as long as its a great tasting  pizza, I'm a fan of any style...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(96/365) "Motor City Pie"

VYup, call Cheaters cause I cheated....I cheated on Goyemon...But like Smokey said,\u000a"Take a picture, write it down, I don't give a F@#K!!!" (from the movie FRIDAY, FYI)\u000a\u000aThe 2 Live Crew, I mean the THREE Live Crew made me do it!!!!!\u000a\u000a1) LIVE Uni (Sea Urchin)\u000a\u000a2) LIVE Mirugai (Giant Clam)\u000a\u000a3) LIVE Amaebi (Sweet Shrimp)\u000a\u000aMASSIVE MAHALOS to Kimberly T. for sharing the love!!!!\u000aWe were planning on a dinner and a movie, but instead, we got an even better dinner and a show!!! Here's how it unfolded:\u000a\u000aTHE PREVIEW\u000a\u000aWe've been to the "Old" Yummy Grill and sushi where they offered Chinese, Local Style plate lunches, and lackluster sushi. Well, ever since The Chef/Owner Eric took over three years ago, he has been slowly phasing out that concept with an "Out with the old, in with the new" High End/Western-Style sushi Bar, catering to both the traditionalist, and one who is all about the rolls. A name change is also in the works... I called in ahead and got everything situated...\u000a\u000aMe: "Hello, I'm calling in to see if you have fresh Amaebi tonight?"\u000aJennifer: "Yes we do"......BIG SMILE!\u000aMe: "How about Live Uni?"\u000aJennifer: "Yes we do".....EVEN BIGGER SMILE, MY CHEEKS ARE HURTING!\u000aMe: "We would like two for the bar...and what time do you close?"\u000aJennifer: " 2am"\u000a\u000a**Cheers from our end of the line, laughter from her end of the line**\u000a\u000aINTRODUCTION\u000a\u000a"Irrasshaimasse!" as we enter the door, Jennifer directs us to our reserved spot at the bar in front of Eric.He introduces himself, the other chefs Sam, and Jun-San, and Jennifer, who we spoke to earlier, he even introduces us to a regular at the bar!\u000aWe introduce ourselves to them all, and while wifey looks through the menu, my eyes are glued to the Fresh Seafood board that changes on a daily basis based on what Eric can get in on that day. We order a live Uni, two Amaebi and a Crazy Jalapeno to start...\u000a\u000aTHE BUILD-UP\u000a\u000aSome amuse-bouche action starts us off with some cucumber sunomono with krab and vegetable-tempura pancakes along with our Crazy Jalapeno. They were all okay, but I came here for the main attractions...Eric brings us our order of two ALIVE AND KICKING Amaebi, and everyone else at the bar is wondering what they are (everyone around us was grubbin' on rolls and yum-yum laced creations, no one even knew what the Uni was when Jun-San brought it out to show us before creating our uni masterpiece with sushi rice!(another option is to have it prepared with cold soba noodles) Eric and the rest of the staff are also so very passionate, personable, and very informative, and  another thing that Eric mentioned is where he gets most of his premium seafood from-Japan (Tsukiji and Kyushu), Spain, and Boston...Hmmmm, sound familiar??? You know for a fact that the specials board is the way to go if you take your sushi seriously. Service here is nothing short of top-notch, and it shows in everything Eric and his staff does.\u000a\u000aTHE ACTION\u000a\u000aOur Amaebi course arrives in three parts-HUGE fried head, tail section with black tobiko, and tail end with yuzu tobiko with a citrus-soy dipping sauce. The tail is so sweet and meaty, and the head is so crunchy and delicious! It is so awesome to watch Eric and the other chefs do their thing with great attention to detail and the passion that is displayed with each piece of edible art they place in front of us.\u000aJun-San hands us our live uni masterpiece, and we dig in to this ocean butta, savoring each and every tasty bite. Coincidentally, everyone at the bar were first timers at that moment, so it called for free sake on the house! The house was also VERY generous to us, with garlic edamame, salmon carpaccio, a bottle of housemade Soju Cocktail, and they weren't done yet! Eric showed us pictures of his fresh fish selections and brought out a huge head of a Kinmedai (Alfonsino) from Tsukiji Market in Japan which was later presented to us grilled! (Ji-Kinmedai Kama) Loved that meaty, fatty goodness! The eyeballs were bomb.com too!\u000a\u000aTHE CLIMAX\u000a\u000aWe ended our dinner with an order each of Kohada (Spotted Sardine, AKA Gizzard Shad) and Mirugai (Giant Clam, AKA Geoduck) Eric brought out the Geoduck before cutting it, and then the ding-a-ling jokes came out between Eric and another guy that had everyone rolling!(See Photos) They were both sooo ONOLICIOUS!!! Oh yeah, one order here is TWO pieces...The "other place" is just one...how's that???\u000a\u000aTHE END/SNEAK PEAK\u000a\u000aTwo and a half hours later, after a great dinner(& show) and talking story throughout the night with everyone just having such a good time, we payed our bill, thanked everyone at Yummy Grill, and seeing our appreciation for "The Good Stuff", Eric capped our night off with an order of melt-in-your-mouth Shima-Aji (Striped Jack)\u000atopped with sea kelp and fresh wasabi...What a first-time experience this was, and most definitely won't be our last....ALOHA!!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(289/365) "Me So Hungry, Me Love You LONG Time!"

VSometimes, spur-of-the-moment decisions are the best ones. We were chilaxing at Tien's welcome back gathering and it came together like this:\u000a\u000aJieun: "We should  go for sushi some time?"\u000a\u000aMe: "You know me, I never say no to sushi, especially this place!"\u000a\u000aJieun: "Maybe I can give Eric a call, and see if its okay with him?"\u000a\u000aMe: Live Uni??? I'm Down!!!\u000a\u000aJieun steps out for a couple of minutes, then returns..."He's got Live Uni, Live Abalone, Giant Clam, and other stuff."\u000a\u000aMe: "Alrighty then, lets do this!"\u000a\u000aSo we met up the next evening at the sushi bar, and we have one whole side reserved for us, and we are greeted by hostesses Jacqueline and Jennifer, and Chefs Eric, Jun-San, and Brian, who are going to orchestrate our Chef's special omakase.\u000a\u000aI love how Eric takes time to explain what he has planned for us course by course and at the same time, showing us the items, and where they came from. It definitely got us even more anxious!\u000a\u000aAfter some amuse bouche action of GARLIC EDAMAME and SUNOMONO, course after course kept coming.\u000a\u000aYUZU GLAZED SCALLOPS (SHARED)\u000aSweet bay scallops coated in panko and perfectly fried, topped with a citrusy yuzu glaze...perfect start \u000a\u000aAGEDASHI TOFU\u000aThe slightly crisp and soft tofu paired with the flavorful dashi and ikura...simply delicious\u000a\u000aSASHIMI ASSORTMENT\u000aWe all recieved a beautiful arrangement of kampachi, hirame, ji-kinmedai,sake, shima-aji, toro, and chu-toro-YUM!\u000a\u000aABALONE SASHIMI(SHARED)\u000aTopped with caviar and a squeeze of lemon, thats all you needed to enjoy the crunchy sweet abalone.\u000a\u000aFLYING FISH TATAKI(SHARED)\u000aThis was a first for everyone...first presented sashimi style, the flying fish was topped with fresh ginger and scallions and enjoyed with ponzu. The head and body were reserved and presented later.\u000a\u000aLIVE UNI(SHARED)\u000aDefinitely the party favorite, this was prepared with sushi rice and topped off with assorted caviar and a quail egg\u000a\u000aASSORTED NIGIRI (1pc.)\u000aIka Shiso\u000aSnow Crab\u000aSurf Clam Topped with Uni...All AWESOME!\u000a\u000aGRILLED/FRIED ASSORTMENT(SHARED)\u000aKampachi\u000aShima-Aji\u000aFlying Fish(Fried head and Body)\u000aWe got down and dirty with this one, leaving no survivors!\u000a\u000aSALMON CARPACCIO(1pc.)\u000aTAKUANTORO(2pc)\u000aAMAEBI(1pc.)\u000aAll excellent!\u000a\u000aEric capped it off with a Western Style SURF AND TURF ROLL\u000aShrimp Tempura Roll topped with Australian Wagyu Beef, and garnished with Crispy Onions, Micro Greens, Yum yum Sauce, and Nori Flakes.\u000aGreat end to the meal which cost as much as a nigiri dinner at that very popular\u000asushi joint next to Trattoria Nakamura-Ya...\u000a\u000a. We all finished with Banana Tempura Ice Cream, and after our meal\u000aEric  had a toast with everyone with a pretty pricey sake.\u000aWhat a great evening ....Good Food, Good Friends, Good Fun....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000a#366/365...ONE MORE FOR LEAP YEAR!!!!!!!

VWe returned yet again for dinner and a show with Chef Eric and the Yummy Grill Ohana, and as always, another memorable night was enjoyed by all..\u000aWarmly greeted by hostesses Jennifer, Jackie, and Jessica, we are seated up at the bar and greeted by all the chefs who are dressed in red, adding a nice touch for the holidays. We are like kids in a candy store at this point and ready to get our omakase on...\u000a\u000aWe start out with some Sunomono and Garlic-Chili Edamame, and we also receieve some tasty house soju and also, a bottle of Gekkeikan Horin Ultra Premium Junmai Daiginjo Sake. I'm no sake expert, and I usually don't have sake, but this was some smooth stuff! Our dinner consisted of the following courses:\u000a\u000aOKAYU WITH ABALONE, TUNA, AND NATTO\u000aWifey never had natto just for the smell alone(fermented soybeans) and I was slightly nervous at first sight, but after her first spoonful, she couldn't stop raving about it! The warmth of the okayu, the smokiness of the abalone, and the nuttiness of the natto with nice chunks of tuna kissed with shoyu and sesame oil all worked well and was an excellent preview of what was in store\u000a\u000aTORO WITH CUCUMBER AND PONZU\u000aNice meaty texture from the Spanish Toro and crisp cucumber and ponzu complimented it very nicely.\u000a\u000aLIVE BOSTON SCALLOP SASHIMI\u000aSweet and succulent, the sashimi was topped with a yuzu-ponzu sauce, dried miso, Italian caviar, and Japanese gold leaf. We also had for the first time the scallop fin, which Chef Eric expertly prepared by cleaning and gently cooking which had a nice tender texture similar to abalone.\u000a\u000aALASKAN KING CRAB WRAPPED IN CUCUMBER\u000aTopped with red and black tobiko this was also very sweet and refreshing.\u000a\u000aLIVE SANTA BARBARA UNI WITH CHIARASHI RICE\u000aAlways a must when available, this time we weren't sharing, so we each got our own! Its THAT good....\u000a\u000aO-TORO TARTARE\u000aChef Eric took a nice fatty slab of O-Toro, made an exquisite tartare and topped it off with a generous portion of Italian caviar and Japanese gold leaf. My opu was crying tears of joy with every spoonful!\u000a\u000aDUO OF HAMA HAMA AND MIYAGI OYSTERS\u000aBoth oysters were delicious with the ponzu and wasabi tobiko. The Hama Hama Oysters had a nice kick with the addition of kimchi.\u000a\u000aThe passion and precision Chef Eric displays throughout this experience is totally unmatched IMHO...He goes into every detail as far as the source, the preparation\u000aof each component, and you are also educated along the way, and I have never seen a more personable Sushi Chef that engages with his guests which is a great reason he has a great following of devoted customers.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Duke of YSG, Kevin P. joined us for a bit, and I offered him some sake but unfortunately he was on the job, so that left me and Chef Eric to finish the bottle because Wifey was slightly buzzin' too. Don't know how many times we kanpai'd throughout the evening but we killed that bottle. People on the other end of the bar were having a sake bomb marathon, and we've never had a sake bomb, nor had we witnessed such a ritual, so the whole bar ends up having sake bombs! Chef Eric nicely orchestrated a total of 9 in a row and it was a cool spectacle to see! Our nigiri fest consisted of the following:\u000a\u000aHALIBUT NIGIRI\u000aFrom Jeju Island, South Korea. Very generous cut of halibut dabbed with a bit of Yuzu Koshi...Nice clean flavor.\u000a\u000aAJI NIGIRI\u000aPremium snapper from Tsukiji, Japan brushed with premium shoyu...absolutely delicious.\u000a\u000aSHIMA-AJI NIGIRI\u000aAlso from Tsukiji, brushed with premium shoyu topped with fresh wasabi...very delicate and tasty.\u000a\u000aKAZUNOKO\u000aHerring Roe in pressed form with what tasted like Saba(Mackerel). Rich, oily, and the crunch of the herring roe gave this a nice textural contrast\u000a\u000aJI-KINMEDAI NIGIRI\u000aThis had a soft texture very similar to Kampachi and we enjoyed this one as well\u000a\u000aHAMACHI NIGIRI\u000aWho doesn't love Hamachi? Simple, straightforward, and awesome.\u000a\u000aTRIO OF TORO NIGIRI\u000aWhat an awesome way to end our sushitarian feast with the prized Bluefin Tuna from Spain! a progression for toro starting with the Akami or loin, followed by Chu-Toro, the center of the belly, and finally O-Toro, the fattylicious underbelly finessed by fresh wasabi, Italian caviar, and Japanese gold leaf...Absolutely mindblowing!\u000a\u000aWe ended on a sweet note with a PLUM ICE CREAM TEMPURA, and once again thanked the Yummy Grill ohana for yet again another stellar evening....ALOHA!!!

VCapping off Wifey's birthday weekend, we visited the Yummy Grill ohana and decided to have Chef Eric surprise us with his creations once again. No Live Uni on the board this time :(:(:(, but still a wide selection of live and fresh selections. Our symphony of sushi consisted of the following:\u000a\u000aFRESH MOZUKU SEAWEED-Very refreshing with a blend of ponzu and tsunumono liquid and fresh ginger, great start.\u000a\u000aJI-KINMEDAI KAMA-The birthday girl's request, the nicely grilled head had tons of flavor and different textures going on- the plump collar and cheek meat, crispy skin and fins, and the juicy eyeball...man, that was good!\u000a\u000aLIVE OYSTERS-Nice, briny, and perfection in one slurp, topped with ponzu, and tobiko\u000a\u000aCLAM MISO SOUP-It was chilly outside so this hit the spot, and the addition of the live clams made it even sweeter\u000a\u000aLIVE ABALONE-Thinly sliced and topped with two kinds of caviar and a squeeze of lemon is all it took to enjoy the sweet crunchy abalone\u000a\u000aLIVE BOSTON SCALLOP-paired with dried miso and ume, sweet, clean, and fresh\u000a\u000aJI-KINMEDAI-Our nigiri set started with the lighter, delicate fish. Feasting on the head earlier, this was a great start to the nigiri action\u000a\u000aSHIMA-AJI-Brushed with aged shoyu and topped with battera kombu...delicious\u000a\u000aKANPACHI BELLY-Topped with jalapeno and a dot of sriracha...:9\u000a\u000aHAMACHI BELLY-Brushed with aged shoyu and kissed with wasabi...YUM!\u000a\u000aHALIBUT SALAD-Halibut "flowers" on a bed of mixed greens with ponzu...great ending before going into the richer fish\u000a\u000aSALMON CARPACCIO-Slightly torched on one side topped with crispy fried parsley and ponzu, always a good one\u000a\u000aSPANISH MACKEREL-Rich and oily, the fresh ginger and scallions were a nice accent\u000a\u000aSASHIMI PLATTER-We enjoyed a trio of Ahi, Toro, and Chu-Toro simply with some shoyu and fresh wasabi....lovely!\u000a\u000aLIVE SANTA BARBARA UNI-It wasn't on the board, but I was more than happy to devour one! Prepared with assorted caviar, chirashi rice and a quail egg, always a favorite!\u000a\u000aDUO OF SOFT SHELL CRAB ROLLS-One topped with tuna, avocado, and caviar, and the other topped with tuna and sweet crispy onions....totally grub\u000a\u000aANAGO-Oh so soft and sweet, I'd take this over Unagi any day. Smokiness of the bonito brought out the flavor of the sea eel even more\u000a\u000aPLUM ICE CREAM- The Yummy Grill ohana came around to sing happy birthday to Wifey, and it capped off another great evening. Not having it tempura style this time, we were able to enjoy the flavor more.\u000a\u000aAlways a great time with Eric and the gang, and can't wait until our next visit...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(28/100) "The Sushi Maestro"

VC'mon now, who hasn't grown up with Mickey D's? Yeah, we all loved them growing up, but slowly got more health conscious as we grew older....Still can't deny the addicting fries though, gotta have 'em once in the blue moon, and the Mc Rib has a cult following that can't wait until they serve it up again!\u000a\u000aMe? I like their food toys.  The Minions are the coolest things lately, and they just crack me up! I just had to add them to my other cool collectibles, the "transforming" Mickey D's food toys...remember those?\u000a\u000aI just wish they brought back the OG Apple Pie...I miss that deep fried goodness!!!\u000a\u000aALOHA!!!

VWifey was jonezing for one of those sloppy sundaes, so we dropped by Sammy's again. We also split a BBQ Chicken Pizza which was aight.\u000aI noticed the new desserts section and their doughnuts sounded good, so I got those which came with two different sauces. If a restaurant offers doughnuts for dessert, you'll more than likely end up disappointed and are better off at somewhere like Ronald's...ALOHA!!!

VA bunch of us decided to get a late night bite at Marnee Thai after the Yelp Elite Event. It's been a long while since we've dined here. With a new chef and new management, the food was pretty good and the service was excellent.\u000a\u000aWe ordered some Pad Thai and Chicken Green Curry(Heat level 1) and I still had the sniffles from each bite of curry. Pad Thai was excellent.  One of the waitresses said they didn't have sticky rice and mango, so no dessert for us, but the funniest thing was when we were outside the restaurant, Tien busted out his smuggled plate of Baklava from Stephanos....ALOHA!!!

Definitely a gardener's candy store, makes me wish my gardening skills were up to par with my cooking and baking skills!\u000a\u000aHuge selection, very organized to help you navigate your way around, workers are very knowledgeable and helpful, and their selection of animals scattered on the grounds of the nursery are COOL!\u000a\u000aHuge Koi pond with turtles and lots of neat exotic birds,and a great place to keep the kids entertained while you shop for seeds, plants, shrubs, etc....My favorite bird of them all would have to be the Toucan. He is such a character!\u000a\u000aStop in for any or all of your plant needs, and even if its outdoors, don't worry about the heat, their misters are on to cool you off while you shop.....ALOHA!!!

VAre you hung over and looking for a cure? Possibly the best bowl of Menudo exists here. For only $7.99 you get a GIANT bowl with all the fixins. So delicious and very filling, we only finished HALF the bowl!\u000a\u000aThe Chilaquiles is another star here. Simple, great tasting, and done right, not some wannabe, overpriced garbage you'd find in the Southwest area *cough* DW Bistro *cough* \u000a\u000aJust about every Latin Joint has their complementary chips and salsa...one of the best baskets may be found here as well. Tortilla rounds fried to order and piping hot with a salsa with no heat- tomato, onion, cilantro and oregano-delicious!\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, the horchata and the tortillas are not made from scratch, but we'll still return. Another puzzling thing is that there are barely any reviews for this business, and only one I know of (Jillian P.)..but they have a "People Love Us On Yelp sticker on the door!?!?...Yes, its in the Sunrise area,(Don't be scurrrred!) yes, it is in the last strip mall you come across driving up E Lake Mead before you're heading for the mountains, so quit your complaining if you want some good Mexican food and do like Rhianna says..."SHUT UP AND DRIVE!"...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013 (49/100) "The Hangover Cure"

VWe hit up this place after getting some Frost Bites(Nothing wrong with dessert before dinner, right?)\u000a \u000aIt doesn't look like anything from the outside, but when you enter, this place is JUMPIN!\u000aat least it was when we visited. Hostesses kindly greet you at the door, and by the looks of it, there seemed to be at least 80% (maybe 90) of Hendersonian regulars that hardly ever venture out of Hendertucky if they don't have to.\u000a\u000aFamily owned and operated, they are out of Buffalo, NY....Birthplace of the Buffalo Wings and have been a Henderson institution for over 20+ years. The plethora of menu items here are unbelieveable, but we came for two of their specialities-Pizza and Wings.\u000a\u000aThe Pizza was good, but a bit greasy, and the wings....they were just okay, I guess my expectations were higher after hearing that they were from Buffalo. Oh well...The Watermelon BBQ sauce was tasty and the service was great, so maybe we'll give Johnny Mac's another try....maybe...ALOHA!!!

The Super Nachos are super huge and tasty, and so is the Al Pastor...Now they need to open one up in our side of town...ALOHA!!!

VWOW!! Ronald's, you got some SERIOUS competition!\u000a\u000aTalk about perfect timing...we were the LAST customers at the Frost Bites trailer, we got the LAST cup of Banana Snow, and it was 8pm. I see in the distance, an OPEN light flashing at Friendly's Donut House. I said to myself  "Self, we're here and they're still open, so we might as well check it out?......LESSSSSSSGO!!!\u000a\u000aIt's 8pm, there's also a dude with his family enjoying their loot, but they were definite regulars because this guy was like Yoda in a Troy Polamalu Jersey nodding his head as he saw me peruse the FULL case snapping shots of donut goodness(at 8pm!?!?!) wifey and I are ready to place our order, I open my wallet, and I find A CRISP ONE DOLLAR BILL.......Nooooooo!!!\u000a\u000aFriendly's, like Ronald's is a cash only business. Luckily, the guy behind the counter mentioned that there was an ATM at Smith's. The guy in the jersey says very calmly "The Glazed is good.....The Glazed is good." He kinda read my mind because I like all kinds of donuts-cake, old fashioned, crullers, etc. but my absolute favorite is a warm yeast raised glazed donut. The worker adds with a smirk "The Maple Bars should be out by the time you get back." So I made like Usain Bolt and 50-yard dashed it to Smith's, and bolted back to see the guy placing the WARM maple bars in the case...:9\u000a\u000aWe HAD to get a Maple Bar, and also got another one of my favorites, Chocolate glazed Bavarian cream donut, a HUGE apple fritter, and a Cherry glazed French Cruller. On his way out, the guy in the Jersey reminds me-"Twist Glazed...Twist Glazed." and as he said, we got a Twist Glazed which was also warm and did not disappoint! It was also my  first time having a Maple Bar and what better way to try it than warm and freshly glazed?...MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH!!! Content with our sugar rush, the other goodies were boxed up and enjoyed for breakfast the next day. Hendersonians are very lucky to have this neighborhood gem!  ALOHA!!!

VAfter a grueling work week, this is the perfect pick-me up to help me finish off the weekend and to prepare me for the week ahead. They have services on the Sabbath, Sundays, and Wednesdays. They also have other branches throughout Las Vegas and online service as well. They have also added a service on Sunday en Espanol as well.\u000a\u000aThe worship team at CCC are an awesome bunch of very talented individuals who perform\u000avery uplifting, engaging, and sometimes even tear-jerking tunes all in the name of Our Father. Lead Pastor Jud Wilhite continues the service with his enlightening and sometimes even comedic messages that hits you and allows you to relate that message to everyday life and the things that surround us in this temporary world. They also provide Child Care for kiddies of all ages, so that us adults would get the full effect of each service. How sweet is that!?!?!\u000a\u000aCentral Christian's mottos, "Come as you are" and "Its okay to not be okay" are simple and straightforward-no matter where you've been, what you've done, or what you're going through at this moment, everyone is welcomed here...no dress code, no rules on race, color, or creed, stop in for a visit, it may be just the thing you need in your life.\u000a\u000a                                                "Living Life"\u000a                                             by Bonnie Mohr\u000a\u000aLife is not a race-but indeed a journey. Be honest. Work hard. Be Choosy.\u000a\u000aSay "thank you", "I love you", and "great job" to someone each day.\u000a\u000aGo to church, take time for prayer, The Lord giveth, and The Lord taketh.\u000a\u000aLet your handshake mean more than pen and paper.\u000a\u000aLove your life and what you've been given, it is not accidental-search for your purpose and do it as best you can.\u000a\u000aDreaming does matter. It allows you to become that which you aspire to be.\u000a\u000aLaugh often. Appreciate the little things in life and enjoy them. Some of the best things really are free.\u000a\u000aDo not worry, less wrinkles are more becoming. Forgive, it frees the soul.\u000a\u000aTake time for yourself-plan for longevity.\u000a\u000aRecognize the special people you've been blessed to know.\u000a\u000aLive for today, enjoy the moment......\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBe blessed...ALOHA!!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(86/365) "Down with the King!"

VYet another uplifting service to close out the year...Last year, it snowed inside..this year, it was Central meets Cirque Du Soleil meets Recycled Percussion with a "Centralized" version of "Do You Hear What I Hear?" complete with Tissue Acrobats hanging from the ceiling, singing Christmas favorites with the Central Worship Team\u000a(Sorry, no songs about snowmen, reindeer, or a man in a red suit)\u000a\u000aPastor Jud delivered a very heartwarming message, and we closed out the service with the tradition of singing "Silent Night". Can't wait to see what they have in store for next year....ALOHA!!!

Yes please! The one dreaded thing no one likes is that dreaded little kid kicking the back of your seat over, and over, and over. Luckily none of that on this flight back to the Bay Area.\u000a\u000aThe Staff are always great and very accomodating as well which makes for an even more pleasant flight...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(344/365) "Smooth Sailin'"

VThis is another one of those "Never knew we had one here" kinda things until we drove by a billboard advertising it. Located in North Las Vegas next to the Neon Museum, The LVNHM has some cool exhibits and is a great way to spend a day\u000awith kids and family.\u000a\u000aHere, you will find various rooms containing Dinosaurs and fossils talking about the prehistoric times, Nevada's wildlife species, Marine animals and even a \u000aknock-off of the petting tank at the Shark Reef Aquarium, but you can't pet them here. They do have feeding times where people can watch and learn about the species that are in the tank. I thought the Cave Fish were pretty cool, a species of fish that have NO EYES and travel by sound instead.\u000a\u000aThere are also rooms with All kinds of wildlife from around the world, a room of Ancient Egyptian times, a mummy named Smokey, and a replica of King Tut's Tomb.\u000aDownstairs, there's an Africa Exhibit and an Evolution exhibit-who believes we came from monkeys!?!?!?! Overall, a cool place to stop in, then you can also check out the Neon Museum next door...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(126/365) "History and Culture"

VThe Cashman Center is a great venue for things like craft shows, bridal spectaculars and even dance competitions...This time, it was the venue for the Grassroots Event with President Barack Obama. Las Vegas locals waited in anticipation to hear what the leader of our country had to say about this very important upcoming election, and his very strong possibility of four more years in office.\u000a\u000aIt was a pretty long wait(at least 2 hours) before the president arrived, and in the process, we were able to chat with actor Hawthorne James (Speed, The Five Heartbeats, The Color Purple, Amistad, etc.) which was pretty cool! The President basically repeated what he said at the Democratic National Convention in his short but sweet 30 minute speech, and before you know it, he was gone with the wind, off to his next stop....Also coming to the Cashman Center in October is the Lowrider Super Show, one of the nation's biggest Car Shows...BE THERE!!!....ALOHA!!!

VWent back for Happy Hour to try other items...This time we got the 12-wing platter(Lemon Pepper, Frank's Red Hot, and BBQ), Bits O Fish, a mini version of their Fish and Chips, Their Steamed Mussels which came in a flavorful tomato broth, and Their Irish Nachos...They were all pretty good,but the mussels were a little overdone. as always we finished off with their Sticky Toffee Pudding, always a great end to an Irish meal....ALOHA!!!

We also ordered a short stack of the sweet cream pancakes which alot of people rave about.\u000aThe grizz was okay, But the gobbler wasn't all that. Niether were the pancakes. Can you say IMITATION VANILLA EXTRACT OVERKILL????\u000a\u000aSorry, but the best pancakes in town still belong to DuPars and a close second to Blueberry Hill IMO.

VFinally! Mexican food with SOUL.....with 2 strikes(Casa Don Juan, and Las Islitas) I guess third time's the charm...\u000a\u000aLos Antojos does Mexican food typical of Mexico City and they do it pretty good! Inside is very modest with simple tables and chairs and pictures and signs of different dishes they offer. Sorry, you won't find Quesadillas that the general American public is familiar with, nor will you find Burritos here....you have been warned.\u000a\u000aWe ordered some Tacos-Tripa, Lengua, Suadero, Cochinita Pivil, and Mole de Pollo. We also got the Consomme Loco, Quesadilla de Rajas\u000aand a Huarache de Asada. I also got an Horchata-Homemade, not from the machine/instant.\u000a\u000aAll of the tacos were good, but the standout was the chicken mole, just like mole should taste. The Consomme Loco is a perfect example of simple food done right, DO get this if you ever dine here! Our first spoonful of this soup, the lady behind our counter saw our smiles and said "Como Su Casa"("Just like home") It did feel as if we were guests in her home as she and her husband always checked on us to see that everything was okay. The Quesadilla was different in a good way...deep fried masa stuffed with cheese and strips of poblano peppers with a crisp exterior. The Huarache was good, but the carne asada was a little tough. We shared a cup of Strawberries and Cream and a Peach Gelatina for dessert. Overall, a good dinner, and definitely worthy of a return visit. You never know if you'll run into Chef Alex Stratta-Yup, this is his spot for Mexican fare....ALOHA!!!

VJust about everyone raves about the sirloin special, now $7.99 for a bleh piece of meat, but there's also the $6.99 Fried Chicken special which is usually on the chef's board up front.\u000a\u000aWanted to try something different than my usual King Cut Prime Rib ($12.99 with either a beer or root beer) so I ordered the Fried Chicken special.\u000aIt is presented in a big basket with steak fries, cole slaw, and FOUR good sized pices of fried chicken.\u000a\u000a$6.99 for all this? Can't go wrong....You don't have to wait a minimum of 20 minutes, and you pay DOUBLE for THREE pieces of chicken at other soul food joints in town.\u000a\u000aCrisp exterior and juicy inside, including the breast which can be dry at times...another good tip is to ask the waitperson for some honey to drizzle onto each bite.....YUM! ...and they serve the real stuff, not the fructose corn syrup fast food stuff....skip the sirloin and give the chicken a shot...Oh, if you,re in the mood for BBQ, go elsewhere...they pre cook their chicken and boil their ribs and then, they heat it on the grill for smokiness, then they brush on the sauce. Been there, done that, never again....ALOHA!!!

We ordered a cheeseburger and come of their little bites;\u000a\u000aMussels, Salmon Tartare, Shrimp Shooters, Grilled Corn on the Cob, Fried Mushrooms....Sound good??? Unfortunately they Sounded better than they tasted, and some of their items just didn' fly with my palate.\u000a\u000aDon't think a return visit is in the future, or ever, with tons of other Happy Hour deals in town with even cheaper prices and much tastier food...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(13/365) "Not-so-Happy Hour"

VI am a fan of Whole (Paycheck) Foods even though I rarely hit up the prepared foods section, I love their huge selection of fresh produce, bulk foods, and  of course, their cheese selection, especially anything with truffles.\u000a\u000aThe seafood section can be hit or miss. This time, they didn't look so good though, lots of frozen stuff, and the oysters and black mussels were open which is a bad sign.\u000aTheir White Toque Escargot were pretty good. For about a buck a piece, each shell has a plump escargot stuffed with garlic-parsley butter.\u000a\u000aHere's a few tips to enjoy your escargot:\u000a\u000aGet a baguette, you need an edible sponge to get all that buttery goodness.\u000a\u000aPut a nice bed of uncooked rice in your baking dish and set the shells in carefully. this will keep the shells from rolling around and spilling out. Warm them just until the butter\u000astarts to bubble, about 10-15 minutes.\u000a\u000aCarefully pick a shell up(caution..HOT!) and dust off any rice stuck to the shell\u000a\u000aPour the butter onto a piece of baguette, then fish out the escargot with a toothpick or cocktail fork. This is seriously a better deal than what you pay for in restaurants...ALOHA!!!

VCame here for redemption the next day after being turned down by the mofos at Secret(ly Pathetic) Pizza. I've tried White Pizzas all around town, and the version served here is the best, IMO, even better than the Rocco's at Charleston.\u000a\u000aThe House White Pizza is KILLER! Mushrrooms and roasted garlic covered with mozzarella and sweet creamy ricotta topped with tomatoes, sauteed garlic spinach and red onions...What's not to love???\u000a \u000aMy Pizza only took 12 minutes and it was a sweet deal for $20. Oh, here's another Pro tip: Use your Yelp Check-in to get a free Cannoli...Another Pro tip? Ask for the shells and filling seperate if you're doing take-out(piping bag included) that way, you can fill them after enjoying your pizza and bite into a crunchy cannoli....ALOHA!!!

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(134/365) "Secret Spot in Summerlin"\u000a\u000aHad no idea this place existed!? A 24 hour late night grub spot by Desert Shores/The Lakes!?!? Thanks to Yelp, there is much more to be discovered after living here since 2004.\u000a\u000aSo just like Kilroy's down in Chinatown, they have a "buzz-in" entrance which makes you feel like you're entering some kinda speakeasy joint, but when you step inside, its filled with locals just having a good 'ol time and chatting it up with the staff.\u000aNow if you come here with health in mind, your pickings on the menu may be very slim to none.\u000a\u000aWent with a Burger(forgot the name) medium rare with sweet potato tots, and wifey ordered a French Dip(I think). Portions here are pretty hefty, but the downfall here is the ability to nail the temperatures for meat. We both requested medium rare and we both got medium to medium well. Maybe I'll order it rare the next time, if there is a next time? We shall see...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  3\u000a*Great service and huge portions, but don't expect restaurant style food

VThis is another place that the company eclipsed the food, IMO...Wifey and I split the Lamb Burger and Athens Fries which seems to be a favorite among lots of reviews.\u000a\u000aI also ordered a Falafel gyro because I haven't had a good Falafel in a while. Don't know if the size of our party was a concern, but when our food arrived, it looked good, but sadly, the taste fell short. The burger itself was pretty good, but the bun was pretty hard, a sign of it being toasted WAY ahead of time. Same with the Falafel, it had a thicker than usual crispy shell(little too long in the fryer?) and was just okay.\u000a\u000aThe Fat Greek serves up a much tastier Falafel Gyro, as well as the ones at Amena.\u000aYou want "crack" Fries? Head down to Greek Bistro in Henderson and taste them for yourself...ALOHA!!!

VOne person's trash is another person's treasure is something that comes to mind every time I step into an antique store and this is one antique store where you can find more treasure than trash. I just love the "thrill of the hunt" and the fact that you never know what you're gonna find(and take home) at every visit. On this day, Me and the wIfey decided to stop in before meeting up with other Yelpers for a day at the Village.\u000a\u000aThere's something for everyone here, and also things from waaaaay back when...The wifey loves to collect vintage hats, and I like to hunt for cool STAR WARS items and all kinds of food collectibles and memorabilia...\u000a\u000aAlso, if you're hungry after browsing the aisles, there's no need to get in your car and drive, because just a few steps away in the antique store off to the side is a tea room/cafe, where they serve tea sandwiches, variuos lunch items, and dessert. Their Chicken Salad-Dried Cranberry Sandwich is pretty Grub!\u000a\u000aOn this visit, there were a few cool things I came across-\u000a\u000aAn autographed water color of little Shirley Temple\u000a\u000aA 50's Style Dining Room Set\u000a\u000aVintage style pedal Cars\u000a\u000aOld School Coca-Cola Soda Machines\u000a\u000aA sealed, unopened Michael Jackson Thriller album\u000a\u000aOld school records and military stuff\u000a\u000aVarious toys and collectibles from the 70's, 80's and 90's\u000a\u000a\u000aStop in one day, you never know what you'll be able to find...ALOHA!!!!

VSurprising no one has reviewed this place....Great food, good service. \u000aReally helps if you can speak Spanish, but their speciality here is cuisine from Honduras, El Salvador , and there are some Mexican food item's always order the Casamiento, or marriage for breakfast-Beans and Rice, two eggs scrambled or sunny side up, chorizo, and fried plantains with sour cream for under $8 is worth it...Tortillas are made by hand, not out of a bag, the women who take your order are the same ones who cook your food...It is as if you were a guest in their home...Also good are their tamales and pupusas $1.50 each, you get full on 2 or 3 and it doesn't break your bank! Will post pictures on my next visit!

VWOW! This ain't Petco or Petsmart, Its way cooler than that. This place is a tad smaller but alot cleaner than Exotic Pets.\u000a\u000aYeah, they got birds, bunnies and reptiles, but the draw here is the Sugar Gliders, The very deadly selection of creepy crawlies for sale, and the three Monkies(None of them are for sale, but cool to look at) Kringle and Bella up front, and Tammy in the Back.\u000a\u000aLoooking at the Scorpions, Centepedes and Tarantulas gave me big time chicken skin in a creepy way, but I thought the Albino Python, and seeing the elusive nocturnal Sugar Glider was cool! The staff are all so cool and helpful too, ready to anwer any questions you may have. Another interesting note was that there were deadly critters on sale from places like Egypt and Vietnam, but none from our own backyard? One of the workers said that anything native to Las Vegas can't be caught and sold...interesting....\u000a\u000aAny time you're in the area, perhaps grubbing on a Cheeseburger at Dispensary Lounge, walk over to Pet Kingdom USA and have a looksee, you never know, you might come home with a new friend...ALOHA!!!

VStopped in my favorite pet store again in hopes of maybe catching a glimpse of a pocket porkster like Honey Boo Boo has, but no success...The guy behind the counter says that they randomly get 2-3 perhaps every other month, and people swap 'em up just as fast as Hostess Twinkies!\u000a\u000aI did get to see a purple frog that looked like Jabba The Hut and some new additions were Siamese Kittens and Shi-Tzu Pups. Did you know that the smaller the pinchers are on a scorpion, the DEADLIER they are??? Just a little factoid they'll run by you while checking out the creepy crawlies up front...ALOHA!!!

VLove these types of mom and pop establishments, which are very rare nowadays with all these food chains all around town....The couple at Geri's bought the business from Geri some years back and they've kept the tradition allive with straightforward, honest food like Geri did...My favorite is "The Works" cheesesteak with onions, peppers, and mushrooms...Their perogies, sweet potato fries, and onion rings make a nice addition to any cheesesteak, and to top it off, they have milkshakes which they blend with those old school blenders, which doubles as your drinking cup! Smooth, creamy and thick, your straw stands up, and for under $3, thats the most cheapest milkshake in town! They also make malts and egg creams, and if you don't see what you're looking for on the menu, they'll even try their best to accomodate you. Forthose of you who love Tastykakes from back East, they have a whole shelf of Tastykakes products.....try them out, you won't be dissappointed....ALOHA!!!

VLocated in the little plaza on Tropicana and Eastern, You can step back into time when you enter The Dispensary Lounge.\u000a\u000aYes there is a water wheel, but that's not all....old school lamps that barely keep the room lit, faux candles on the tables, and each booth sectioned off by cheesy fake Ivy crawling all over, mixed with people from all walks of life ranging from 21-70, throw in some live Jazz, and you got yourself a cool evening!\u000a\u000aThey have a pretty small drink list, and standard bar food, but the $3.95 1/2 pound steak burger is pretty solid. Cooked to your desired temperature, it is served on a hot toasted bun along with an ice cold slice of beefsteak tomato, green leaf lettuce, red onions and a fat pickle spear. Additional toppings range from $.50-$.75 (Bacon. American, Swiss, or Mozzarella cheese, Sauteed Mushrooms, caramelized onions, and jalapenos)\u000a\u000aThe size of their burgers are huge like Kilroy's, full of flavor, and still cheaper than most burgers around town even if you add a few toppings. Loaded with fries on the bottom of the basket, it is some good econo eats, and their killer honey mustard goes better with the fries than the plain old ketchup. Service could use a little help though. There was that one poor cocktail waitress taking care of ALL tables on the floor... I'd most definitely return for their burger!...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(196/365) "Old School Burger at Old School Prices"

VSorry John, your house looks very traditional, but thats about it.

Even worse,\u000athe spice, sweetness, and smokiness from the sauce tastes kinda off with a tanginess like a barbecue sauce!?!?!\u000a\u000aUnfinished entrees, and totally dissappointed, a strong fishy odor permeated the dining room from a fried fish that was being delivered to the table next to us(feel sorry for that next victim)\u000aIt was time for us to say adios for good....ALOHA!!!

VWent back to my stomping grounds for my omega fix, and what can I say, never dissappointing and always tasty....Started with the specials-fresh scallops, amberjack and super white tuna(Escolar), followed by more nigiri-hamachi belly, salmon, unagi amaebi, and my favorite, uni'\u000aside dishes-fried amaebi heads, AKA the best shrimp chip you'll ever have, fried calamari(softest in town!), baked mussels, hamachi kama, back to ahi poke nigiri, amd spicy tuna nigiri with raw quail egg(I swear it tastes like pepperoni!)  on to rolls- spider, pastel, and tiger, ending with tempura and green tea ice cream...for 24.95 at lunch? best deal in town:) 5 stars now, because they don't set a time limit, at least for us, because we've bcome familiar faces there, and we've also help bring in big time revenue for them....I think the longest we've lasted was about 2 1/2 hours!!!

Its ice cream sandwiched between two oatmeal cookies and entirely dipped in chocolate.\u000a\u000aMost grocery stores have Vanilla, but this Vons has Mint and Cappucino It's-Its which is even better!

VSo we went to check Hikari out as suggested by a co worker of mine...as a paying customer and a chef in the industry TASTE is EVERYTHING! my co-worker mentioned AYCE sashimi and raw oysters, so that is what i tried first. The sashimi was pretty decent. so we asked for two orders of oysters, thinking they were gonna come like nigiri(2 per order) because it takes time to shuck raw oysters....one of the chefs yells to the back"two dozen" oysters! My wife and I looked at each other thinking "we didn't say DOZEN!?" We really thought that they were being funny, but no more than 5-10 seconds later, two dozen are handed to us....BIG RED FLAG...There is nothing more simple than a perfectly shucked oyster, plump, full with all is juice, and most importantly, free from the second muscle that holds the oyster in place. These oysters were none of that with the sunken in "pre-shucked" look you would see in a buffet totally disguised by the green onions, ponzu, and hot sauce  Some were even stabbed in half by the oyster knife and still clung to the shell because of that muscle on the bottom. Being in a open kitchen atmosphere is great for the sushi chefs to be able to interact with the guest, but that doesn't mean you have to sacrifice the quality and integrity of your ingredients. so as the night progressed, we tried their uni, amaebi, super white tuna etc. all okay...I see Hamachi Kama on the menu and I prepare to order that after I finish their less than impressive Frallops, rubbery calamari, and Hikari express roll with tons of crab "filler", and their ghetto version of Dynamite. This Kid sitting next to me orders the collar and so I sit back to see what it looks like. Again, when I order Hamachi Kama, I expect to wait at least 10 minutes...NOT MORE THAN 1 MINUTE later, the kids order arrives!? again with the "Pre done, warmed up look. ANOTHER RED FLAG! I guess the sushi chefs rather save time for their comedic antics out front, and it shows. The kid had this grossed out, unappetizing look and his mom hands it back to the waitress saying "He didn't like it"...we finished the evening with some green tea ice cream and mango sorbet, which wasn't included with AYCE. If you want quantity over quality, this place is for you. also if you plan on throwing down on sashimi and sub-standard oysters, this seems to be their "hook" I noticed that there's also an event here tomorow night....have fun, and if there's future plans for another sushi social, at my stomping grounds(Sushi-Mon on Silverado Ranch andfMaryland Pkwy.) I'll be glad to meet up with all you fellow yelpers. Limited menu, dessert not included, and worst of all, pre-done food is a big no-no in my AYCE book....ALOHA!!!!

MEYER LEMONS! These are the best lemons ever, and at $2.00 for a bag of four huge lemons, that's a steal!\u000a\u000aAs I was whipping up dinner, I juiced those bad boys(24 ounces of juice just from 8 lemons!), cut the lemon peels up, blanched them, and candied them(Yuzu Soda ring a bell?) and VOILA! We had refreshing meyer lemon soda to go with our dinner.\u000a\u000aNow I don't have to worry about going to Cafe De Japon for their Yuzu Soda, I have meyer lemon lemonade and soda for days!(I'm sipping on some as I write this review!..:9)\u000aI'm gonna have to buy another bag to make preserved meyer lemons, a great ingredient to add to chicken or fish.....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(15/100) "My Meyer Lemon Encounter"

VThis is the "Real Deal Holyfield" of Custom burgers period. Don't waste your time trying to decide(ie, BLT, LBS, Smashburger......RU Kidding Me???????)\u000a\u000aHe has a great selection of beers and milkshakes to go with your custom burger as well... My last Creation was the kobe burger medium rare of course, on a toasted onion bun, caramelized onions,\u000acrumbled blue cheese, applewood smoked bacon and a fried egg....and as always a side of his Black Truffle Sauce to enjoy with each and every bite. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! Unless you Really wanna splurge, go for his Rossini burger with Foie Gras and Black Truffles(maybe one day......)\u000a\u000aOnion rings and sweet Potato Fries make a good compliment to the bugers as well....Trust me, if you want a good burger, this is where you want to go....ALOHA!!!

We haven't shopped here or dined at any other spot except for their sweet shop which wasn't that great either.\u000a\u000aNot too much to say about this casino, but they have a cool looking club if you're into that scene, and a new celebrified restaurant if you feel like splurging a little...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(328/365) "Oui,Oui, Faux Paris"

VI've dined here a few times but still no review???? Well, here it goes....Every time my friend (who is also a chef) comes to town, we always meet up here and we get our usuals. He gets his Steak Av Poivre, I get my Escargot app, and my Hanger Steak with Merlot Butter.\u000a\u000aOn this recent visit, we dined with another couple (who are also chefs)\u000aThey had never been here before, and when they asked for suggestions\u000a(and we all knew this was coming) Our waitress, thinking we were just your typical tourists naturally upsells the more pricier steaks to them, adding that the hanger steak is way more tougher, and she suggests the Filet Mignon instead...Our whole table just gave each other "the look"....Husband finally decides on a grilled chicken and veggies because he's trying to watch his red meat intake. His wife orders the Hanger Steak as well.\u000a\u000aEveryone enjoyed what they ordered, and when it came to desserts, we just let our waitress do her littlte dessert shpeel (even though we were gonna check out the pastry shop instead) If you could only see the expression on her face when she found out she was serving a table of chefs....Classic!...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(20/365) "Trying to con a Chef's Table"

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(182/365) "Birthday Brunch"\u000a\u000aIt's been quite a while since I've been here... Waaaay back when Olivier(Baguette Cafe) was still the manager here. 2005 B.Y.(Before Yelp) to be exact. A bunch of us came out to celebrate Terri R.'s birthday, and what a great time it was!\u000a\u000aI've only dined here for lunch and dinner, so I was excited to dine here for Sunday Brunch because breakfast/brunch is my favorite meal time. What I like about brunch is that you have both sweet and savory options available and the menu selections here did not disappoint! We started with a pastry assortment of a Blueberry Streusel Muffin, Apple Danish, Almond Croissant, and Pecan Sticky Bun. Each one had its own distinct flavor and was very good.\u000a\u000aI must add that our waiter Homero was a SUPERSTAR from beginning to end! The service provided by him and his team of runners and busers added to our stellar dining experience. Everyone's entrees looked delicious, and I went for the Corned Beef Hash which came with two eggs and brioche toast. Wifey got the popular Croque Madame which has been on the menu since day one(I helped open the flagship location in Yountville) the taste was the same, but I think the brioche slices have gotten thinner.\u000aMy Corned Beef hash was delicious and a very generous portion too. A very good choice if you choose to dine here for brunch.\u000a\u000a Towards the end of our meal, we were also surprised to see that checks were split(we had a party of 15) and no auto-gratuity wasn't on the bill which is totally unheard of these days, especially on the strip, I just hate auto-grat period, and we've all dealt the calculating BS when a restaurant doesn't honor split checks when it should be part of their job...no headaches on this day, and it was done with no problem. Thanks again Terri for organizing this fun and memorable day!  ALOHA!!! \u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  5

VAs they say, "You get what you pay for"  The $7.77 Steak Special is just that. A small side salad, and an entree of grilled shrimp skewers, a cheap quality striploin and real mashed potatoes.\u000a\u000aNot terribly bad, not ridiculously good...just A-OK...\u000a\u000aKinda reminds me of the Ellis Island Sirloin Special, smaller steak but with a grilled shrimp skewer instead of an ice cold beer...ALOHA!

VIts been quite awhile since Shoop's Burgers in the Antique Mall of America shut its doors. It was an old school burger joint that even served up hot dogs, shakes, malts, and even green river soda. Ever since then, there hasn't been anything like it here in town until the South Point Gourmet Food Truck Festival.\u000a\u000aThe Pie-N-Burger Truck from California served up one of the best bites of the night.\u000aa cheeseburger, simple, but done right- toasted bun, well seasoned fresh ground beef(not a pre-made perfect circle) absolutely delicious....so wanting to find that similar taste we searched for a local business and skipped all the chains and franchises which brought us to Tiffany's...\u000a\u000aBeing around for over 50 years and looking at the pictures, everything looked good.\u000aWe got the Tiffany and Wisconsin Burger, which the cook who made our food said were their sellers, but when he busted out the pre-made patties onto the flat top, we knew, that it wasn't gonna cut the mustard.\u000a\u000aWhile the atmosphere here is cool, the burgers are more about quantity, not quality...my search for an "old school" style burger continues.....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE(183/365) "Big Portion, Little Flavor"

VWe've seen Mystere a few times, and I even was part of the act one time!\u000a(The Part where the old man takes me to go have some bubbly with someone elses wife while her husband is looked up on stage)\u000aThis time, Carlos Mencia was in town, and wifey scored some tickets-COOL!\u000a\u000aI've been a huge fan of Carlos Mencia waaay before he was a headliner during the early HBO comedy days. I love his style of comedy which is a no-holds-barred approach with no filter at all. Simply put, If you can't take a joke, or the truth, then his shows are not for you. He will touch on various races, current events, politics, and everything in between.\u000a\u000a Like how celebrities are also getting on the weight loss band wagon, Mr. Mencia also shed some weight and looked alot healthier and people in the audience had to do a double take to be sure it was him....it sure was as soon as the jokes started coming!\u000a\u000aHe had the crowd going from beginning to end, from poking at different races, how he doesn't support the whole Quincenera tradition, to the last time America's economy was in good hands was when a president got impeached for a BJ, and even getting really personal, discussing his sexually charged parents, and being a victim of abuse in the catholic church.\u000a\u000aHe's come a long way from Honduras, and its great that he can leave the past behind him and move on and continue what he does best and at the same time being\u000agracious for his fans....Thanks for the laughs all these years Carlos!...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(207/365) "The Mind of Mencia"

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(145/365) "Ghost Town"\u000a\u000aAfter drinks at The Scarlet Bar, we decided to check out Ghostbar since we've never been, and took advantage of the free passes.\u000a\u000aSkipped the line and straight up to the club we went. The inside looks very classy, but strangely, almost no one was dancing. Totally dead inside, but the DJ played a good variety of songs though. The party was out on the sky lounge where everyone enjoyed\u000athe spectacular Vegas views and sipped cocktails. I don't know about you, but don't do well with heights, and that glass section of the floor doesn't help either!\u000a\u000aA split second downward glance, and I was done! We didn't consume any drinks,but had a good time enjoying the view, and after about half an hour, we went across to their other club, Moon.  ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  3

VCool little venue for checking out concerts. Came her to see UB40 for an awesome concert, and we recently returned to see Reggaeton artist\u000aDon Omar.\u000a\u000aWe stood in a very long line that stretched around more than half the casino floor. Guys were pimpin' their best threads and ladies were hoochiefied in their highest heels and skimpiest skirts....immediately that song from the movie Friday played in my mind("hood rat, hood rat hoochie mama!!!")\u000a\u000aOnce finally inside, the crowed waited at least 45 minutes before the opening act came on. Then came about an hour intermission before Don Omar came on. Luckily, the crowd wasn't restless at all and the concert was a blast, regardless if it was standing room only...ALOHA!!!

VWe came here recently for Social Media Day with a show put on by Steel Panther, and having attended other concerts before, I think its a cool place to go for a concert, but I prefer grabbing a table and enjoy a show while seated.\u000a\u000aBeing on the floor is cool, but standing room only? No thanks....plus the claustrophobic situation that follows?...Pass...Do yourself a favor and pay a little more for your own spacious seating area...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(315/365) "Sit Or Stand???"

VThis was plan B after Caf Zupas was closed(Yes, it was on a Sunday)\u000a\u000a Pretty much the same set up like Fresh Choice and all those other "soup and salad" joints...I like that this time we went, they were featuring "Tastes of the World" items featuring the Mediterranean regions. Keeps the food selection a little exciting and new.\u000a\u000aLots of drink choices to chose from as well, but I always go for the Strawberry Lemonade and flavored iced teas whenever we dine here. Service  is pretty awesome here, they're always bussing plates quickly, and even a manager was going around to each table offering freshly baked chocolate chip cookies! \u000a\u000aI love their selection of muffins and flatbreads too, but their pasta section could use some improvement. The dessert section is pretty minimal, but for the price, the overall spread at Sweet Tomatoes ain't bad at all.... 3.5 stars...ALOHA!!!

VYou never find pinball machines at arcades, laundromats, bars, or pizza parlors anymore. Thank goodness the owner of PHOF has a great passion for the preservation for pinball machines,a dying form of entertainment.\u000a\u000aThere are all kinds of pinball machines, old and new, and there's also a section of 80's arcade games, and other types of non-pinball games as well. Don't forget to check out the oldest machine from 1938 that still works. I liked the head-to-head pinball machine where two can play at the same time. This place has something for everyone of all ages(a grandma was having a blast playing with the dancing clown machine and a little girl was with her daddy playing on the Avatar pinball machine)\u000a\u000aMy favorite pinball machines were KISS, Guns N Roses, and of course Star Wars-look closely inside the machine...someone switched it to say 'Fart Wars"-Yeah, I had to do a double take....All the 80's arcade  games were awesome as well. one chocolate Yoo-Hoo and two and a half hours later, we worked up a hunger and were in search of some lunch...ALOHA!!!

VAlways a good time every time we stop by. This time, I was planning to play the cool looking Transformers pinball machine, but unfortunately the idiots playing the machine were on there even after we left.\u000a\u000aWe settled for our other favorite pinball machines and retro games, and we came across this old school game called Space Pilot, where using eye-hand coordination, you needed to fly the spaceship at the right height and speed, and hit the markers that light up one by one before time runs out. Needless to say, I sucked and didn't hit any markers, and wifey played it like a pro and opened a can of whoop-ass on me. \u000a\u000aNow we moved on to air hockey...Redemption? Nope, with a couple of careless errors, wifey schooled me yet again! Win some you lose some....in my case, I won none and lost both, but nevertheless, a fun time as always!....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(172/365) "Game Over"

This was also our first time trying the Turnip Cakes and Chicken Roll.\u000a\u000aRegardless of how busy they were, service was quick, efficient, and great.

VI remember these stores on just about EVERY street corner in Waikiki, and now we also have them scattered around the strip too.\u000a\u000aWhile we were waiting on our order of deep fried twinkies @ Mermaids, we were chatting with the lady about the whole Hostess ordeal and she tipped us off about maybe scoring some Hostess items "across the street"...I'm a big fan of food collectibles-from rare food toys, food and wine books and magazines, menus of places that have closed down, to old school Primo Beer with the old formula still in the bottles, etc.....\u000a\u000aWe went across the street not expecting to find anything, but low and behold, tucked away in the back-Zingers of every flavor, Ho-Ho's, and the last packages of Chocolate Cupcakes, and Sno-Balls. I grabbed one of every package to add to my collection. Who knows how long these are gonna last, but with the amount of preservatives in these things, probably a pretty long time. Is it the last of these iconoic items Americans grew up with??? We shall see...there are already talks about saving the popular Twinkie...ALOHA!!!

VCame here for the first time a few months ago to watch "Star Dancer Born Tonight", \u000aa dance competition featuring all-stars from "So You Think You Can Dance?" U.S. and China.\u000a\u000aKinda awkward that there's only one way in, and one way out, but luckily this wasn't a big concert which probably would have been worse. Seating is typical arena seats and the ushers are very nice in helping direct you to your seats.\u000a\u000aThere were different styles of dance displayed such as tap, belly dancing, lyrical, b-boying, popping, locking, krumping, and jazz. What I didn't understand(and what happened for most of the competition) was how different genres of dance were going to be scored equally? There seemed to be more lyrical dancers on both teams, but you would see Belly dance vs. Hip Hop, Lyrical vs. Krumping, and Tap vs. Lyrical??? Dancers Travis Wall and B-Boy Hok(Quest Crew) are the only familiar faces I saw, and when it came to their turns to battle, both Travis and Hok lost!?!? In the singles categories and also in pairs....fixed judging??? Who knows....\u000a\u000aAfter witnessing all of the dancing which was pretty cool, the competiton was close(according to the judges), but I felt like the Chinese came to compete and were more polished in their performances, where the Americans looked like they were treating this as more of an exhibition than a competition. This show was also being taped for broadcast in China, so with that being said, I'm sure you know who won....ALOHA!!!

Its\u000acool to be able get a taste of home here.\u000a\u000aYou can find cooking supplies and home accents here too...\u000aThe snacks and candy section ain't too shabby either.....Stop in when you have some time to kill, you never know what you're gonna get..ALOHA!!!

VStopped in after breakfast to pick up some Hawaiian goodies. The poke selection looked tempting, and so did the poi, but we just decided to get non-perishable things since we had other stops to make.\u000a\u000aAlways a fun time in this store, not only to check out the wierd and bizzare food items ilke haggis, duck balut and an English pudding called Spotted Dick,\u000athey also carry a wide assortment of home accents, cookware, kitchen gadgets, and a MASSAGING HULA HOOP!?!?!?!?!(Boy does that look like it would hurt BIG TIME!-See Photo)\u000a\u000aAndrew Zimmern would feel right at home here.....ALOHA!!!

As we're taken to our table, across the room, a wedding is going on!?!?!\u000a\u000aTotally felt like wedding crashers, and there was NO WAY we were gonna have a decent meal/conversationn with all these distractions.\u000a\u000aAs the wedding party got up to do the Electric Slide, we got up and headed for the door and headed next door for cover at China Mama.....ALOHA!!!

VBeen here about 4-5 times now for dinner and  have yet to review, so here it goes-\u000a\u000aThis is another restaurant that I've found that caters to Hawaiians because on our recent visit, our waitress just so happened to ask if I was from Hawaii because of our usual order of Crispy Kau Gee Min with Crispy Cake Noodle..."Pearl City" I reply...."I thought so" she says. "A lot of Hawaii people come here and always order cake noodle...I'm from Kaimuki side" she replies...The owners have been there for the past 11 years and their food has been consistent in all our visits there.\u000a\u000aWanting to try other things we got the dinner for two which consisted of two soups, two appetizers and two entrees..\u000a\u000aSylvia ordered Hot and Sour soup, fried shrimp, and ginger beef\u000a\u000aI got the won ton soup, fried won tons, and kung pao shrimp\u000a\u000anot thinking that everything is served FAMILY STYLE here, our table for two looked like a table for 6-8!!!!!\u000a\u000ano complaints though, we attacked what we could and had lunch for the next day....everything was tasty but the standouts for me were the won ton soup, kung pao shrimp, and of course, the crispy kau gee min with crispy cake noodle. Can't go wrong for $30... Packing up our leftovers, I mentioned to our waitress "Too bad you can't find good Manapua(Cha siu bao) here"\u000a\u000aShe slapped me on the shoulder saying 'We have Manapua AND Pork Hash!" I hadn't seen it on the menu, but its posted along the back of the restaurant along with other off the menu items, such as your ghetto style Malasadas(Fried Pilsbury Biscuit dough) so for any of  you looking for Manapua or Pork Hash, they serve it at Noodle Palace. Next time, I'll take an extra 5 minutes to read their other off the menu items and to avoid another possible slap....ALOHA!!!

VThis is another spot we checked out due to high yelp ratings...\u000aWe started out some Chowda and Fanny Bay Rocks which was tasty.\u000a\u000aNext, we shared the combination pan roast almost everyone raves about...\u000awhat you need to know before you order is they'll tack on a $5 sharing charge which is totally wack. It was a good glorified seafood bisque, but definitely not worth $20...Loaded is an understatement, there were pieces of seafood, but definitely not loaded.\u000a\u000aI'm glad we came though because now that I've seen Joe prepare it step by step and the ingredients that go in it, I can duplicate it my way, with no skimping on seafood and no sharing charge...ALOHA!!!

VVPN-Vero Pizza Napoletana,,,,,Thats what sets Settebello apart from all the other pizzerias in town. It is the stamp of approval given by the pizza making authority in Italy, and only a handful of establishments in the U.S. have been given this distinction, so if you come across any of these establishments sporting the VPN signage on their front door, you know its the real deal like you would find in Naples, All you pizza snobs stop comparing it to NY or Chicago style, because it doesn't even compare! They're trying to keep tradition and integrity by following the traditional pizza making ways as they do IN NAPLES! If you want Pepperoni or Pineapple, CALL DOMINOS!!!\u000a\u000aOkay, done with my rant...on to my review. Been going to Settebellos ever since they were first located on Valle Verde and Horizon Ridge. It was hidden away and not too many people knew about this place until they made the move to The District. The ingredients are top-notch, and ALL their pizzas are the BOMB! I've tried everything- Margherita, Carbonara, Ripieno, etc. and my favorite, The Settebello. The ONLY way to devour all this goodness is the minute it is placed in front of you and there's no better way to finish with an Affogatto,Double espresso with a scoop of gelato. Looking forward to return again soon,,,ALOHA!!!

Although its close to us, we rarely drop by because of other similar stores with similar items with a little more variety(HomeGoods, Rocket Fizz, International Marketplace, etc.)\u000a\u000aI'm always in the kitchen/foods section of the store because I never know what cool stuff I may find. I saw authentic Paella Pans from Spain, and am so happy that CPWM carries them again...Paella party for sure when the weather gets warmer!...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(8/100) "Paella Party!"

The Black Cod Lettuce Wraps were very delicious, I had to get two orders!\u000aSalmon Belly, Hamachi, and Unagi were pretty solid as well, but the memorable one for me was the New Zealand Snapper. Very Tasty!\u000a\u000aIf you're ever in the area, this is a great place to check out. For me though, I'll stick to my usual spots around town...ALOHA!!!

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(146/365) "No Moon Out Tonight"\u000a\u000aWow, guess we were lucky to check it out before they pulled a Gordon Ramsay and \u000a"shut it down"....\u000a\u000aPretty good song selection and vibe as it was more happening than Ghostbar which we had checked out just a few minutes before!  Odd...again, we just popped in for a looksee, hella tourists, go-go dancers shakin' it  and that was about it. They're probably gonna gut the place, switch up the vibe/theme and give it a new name as is the case with almost every other club on the strip.

VDriving down Decatur after picking up my Paella book, its lunch time and I see a little sign that says Fat Greek. I'm always down for some good Greek grub, so I pull into this strip mall area, and Its tucked away in the corner close to Food 4 Less.\u000a\u000aAs I step inside, this place is JUMPING for lunch! You can't help but notice the blue and white color scheme inside, and the staff are very hospitable people. So I decided to order take out, but I'll definitely plan on coming back with the wife so we can dine in. I couldn't decide whether I wanted a chicken gyro or a falafel gyro, so I did the most sensible thing...\u000a\u000aI got both! Problem solved, and I ASSUMED that they were the same usual size as all the other gyros I've eaten.....When I opened the take out containers to attack, my reaction was WOW!....These gyros are MASSIVE!\u000aTo give you an idea, one gyro is about equivalent to  two banh mi sandwiches from DAKAO, and they're a pretty good size. I ate the equivalent to four banh mi because I killed 'em both. \u000a\u000aThis is one of those"how could I have not known about this place after living here long enough?" deals...Well, that's why we have Yelp:)...ALOHA!!!

VRemoving 2 Stars.....1 for spotty service from the Greek waiter. Homeboy acted like he had a BIG stick up his behind... no customer service skills at all.\u000a\u000aWe shared the Avgolemono(Egg and Lemon Soup with chicken and rice)\u000agood flavor, came with warm pita bread, so far so good.\u000a\u000awifey orders a Chicken Gyro, I go with the Chicken Shawerma, and we both share the Athenian Fries. Fries were good, But I still prefer Greek Bistro's Greek Fries seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, and Zatar, served with a yogurt dip.\u000a\u000aBoth the Gyro and Shawerma  were made with chicken breast that was definitely grilled and sliced WAY AHEAD OF TIME, and was borderline room temp./cold( probably from lunch),\u000aand our pita bread was cold and tough! The pita that came with our soup was hotter! For dessert, the nice waitress (who got my to-go order in my first review) was much more informative about the menu and very personable. We get the Baklava and the Bugacha.(Greek puff pastry dessert filled with vanilla(or chocolate )pastry cream. Baklava was overly sweet, but the bugacha was crisp, warm, and not too sweet. Decent ending to our pretty disappointing meal. Bad first impression for the wifey and I felt worse after\u000a"hyping" this place up after my first visit. Hard to say if we'll be back...ALOHA!!!

VWe were in the area and I wanted to pick up a few items to duplicate Komol's Herbal Salad.\u000a\u000aI also picked up a bottle of Estrella Damm Inedit, the Beer from the folks at El Bulli that went with the Lobster and Citrus course at e' by Jose Andres. Its also cool to see that I could also get items from home like Wailua Soda, Rare Hawaiian Honey(pricey, but worth every penny!) and even Bubbie's Mochi Ice Cream.\u000a\u000aThe Cheese Selection here is pretty awesome here too. I always gotta get a wedge of one of my favorite cheeses, Sottocenere, a cheese LOADED with truffle goodness!\u000a\u000aYes, alot of things here are priced pretty steep, but on the other hand, you can't find some items elsewhere....Still a big fan, and still coming back!....ALOHA!!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(85/365) "Whole Paycheck"

VWe stopped in for a little snack and ordered the Mantra Masala Appetizer Sampler\u000aand a basket of Garlic Naan.\u000a\u000aDon't remember the names of the items  on the sampler, but it was Samosas, a crispy onion thing, and  a batter fried chicken Item. The first two were good, but the chicken was tough. The two chutneys that came with the sampler were delicious too.\u000a\u000aNot the best Indian food we've had, but seems like the only one in  the area. ALOHA!!!!

VThe closing down of Hostess prompted us to finally step foot in Mermaid's Casino after living here since 2004.\u000a\u000aCheap eats is one of the draws here, the fried oreos and twinkies in particular. We've always seen all this deep fried goodness at festivals and fairs but have never gotten around to trying them, so we figured we'd get in on the action of trying it for perhaps the first and last time since the Hostess outlet in town shut its doors, and all store shelves have been cleaned out of the signature Hostess items.\u000a\u000aThe staff behind the counter were even generous enough to sell me twinkies still in the wrapper and even grab me a box too.(Not to eat, more as a keepsake of American Pop Culture) We took our first bite, and it was dangerously good!\u000akinda like a funnel cake and twinkie in one and the cream filled center didn't taste overly sweet either. Now I can say I've tried a deep fried twinkie, but wouldn't attempt it again knowing that all this hydrogenated/processed stuff  really ain't good for you....ALOHA!!!

VSushi Wa?????? More like Sushi Wat da F---?????????????\u000aCame out for Teri K.'s UYE. It was great seeing familiar Yelp faces and also meeting new Yelp faces too.\u000a\u000aOur party sat on a bamboo "jungle inspired" table that would later serve as our bamboo"jail".....\u000a\u000aFoodwise, that's what gets this review 2 stars. Seafood wasn't as fresh as other reviewers say, especially the Uni. Most of the nigiri were okay, but the rolls sounded and looked better than they tasted. The green tea was actually a very pale "yellow"(SEE PHOTO) which was also dissappointing.VERY skimpy on the matcha powder....\u000a\u000aServicewise, Sushi WTF gets a BIG FAT ZERO!!!!! First, pretty boy goes and takes our orders, and royally screws up forgetting what some of our table ordered, then he obviously gives better service to the Korean speaking side of our table. This went on for most of the night.\u000a\u000aWhen it was time to pay the bill, pretty boy, had a temper tantrum because he didn't like that we each paid seperately which would mean individual transactions and more work for him, and gave attitude to a couple of people in our party. This is when we were held "hostage" at the bamboo jail.\u000a\u000aI began to feel like DeNiro and Walken in The Deer Hunter when they were held hostage in the bamboo cage. Over an hour later, the taller manager finally gets everything situated and we are no longer held prisoners\u000aand needless to say, I don't think anyone in our party will be returning....EVER! Sushi-Wa has just joined my S--t list of sushi joints!\u000aHopefully someone removes that Yelp sticker on their window...ALOHA!!!

VA pretty decent cup of coffee can be found here, and a sweet side room as you enter on your left is very spacious with an ample amount of tables and chairs perfect to hold a donut crawl which is what we did thanks to Michael U.'s quick thinking after our original designated venue was closed.\u000a\u000aYou can get your coffee done every which way here-Iced, blended, flavored, straight, seasonal blends and creations, you name it, they can do it. I was looking for something straightforward and simple, and nothing flavored, chilled, or blended.\u000a\u000aI went with a simple Cafe Au Lait and it was delicious! I didn't need to add anything, I just had to use it as a "chaser" after every bite of donut, and boy did we have A LOT of them!\u000aThe staff was very nice and even told us not to worry after we re-configured the room with the tables and chairs. We were totally lucky on this day...I could just imagine what a madhouse it could be when school is back in session.

I've never been to Mr. Tofu and I'm glad I finally got the chance.\u000a\u000aMy go-to item here is the Dolsot Bibimbap, just as good as Island Style's\u000aversion. talk about a hot meal, you'll have that from beginning to end\u000a\u000aTheir banchan selection is great, as well as the service. Thanks fellow Yelpers, this is one of the places where I agree with the 5 star rating. I loved it the first time, Went back the following weekend while everyone else was suckin' on mudbugs next door and had the place to ourselves. What did we order? You guessed it, Dolsot Bibimbap:).....ALOHA!!!

VWe dropped by again for the best Dolsot Bibimbap in town(Sorry Island Style, Mr.Tofu's got you beat.)\u000a\u000aThis time, we requested to have the rice extra crispy, and extra crispy is what we got to enjoy the yummy extra crunchy layer when you mix everything together with a nice helping of Cochujang:)\u000a\u000aI just love their ever changing assortment of banchan as well. this time we got to try some pickled eggplant, and pickled chili peppers, seeds and all, but no sign of any heat at all. They were so good, we got another round. \u000a\u000aWe will most definitely be back in no time...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(26/365) "Hottest Meal in Town"

VIn Search of soul food, we checked this place out. We've been to Kathy's a few times and were looking for other options. Kathy's does"Louisiana" style and M&M does"Mississippi" style...Lotta similarities, not too many differences.\u000a\u000aWe ordered the Fried Chicken and BBQ Shortribs. We had mac and cheese, potato salad, yams, stuffing, and fried okra for our sides.\u000a\u000aAs with Kathy's, the fried chicken alone takes 20 minutes, so these corn cakes couldn't have come at a better time. We got some punch and a muddy water, AKA Arnold Palmer(Lemonade/ice tea blend) to go with our corncakes. These were so addicting, I could have scarfed down four or five more, but we waited patiently for our Southern feast to arrive.\u000a\u000aThe Chicken was crisp and juicy, but a little on the salty side from possibly being over seasoned, the sides were okay, but not great, something was missing. Our BBQ Ribs had more bones, fat, and sauce, than actual meat.(Check my Pix)\u000a\u000afor dessert, we tried the banana pudding with nilla wafers, and the sweet potato pie. again, good, but not great.\u000a\u000aoverall, an okay experience, but not good enough to "make me wanna slap my momma!" ...ALOHA!!!

VStopped in since we were in the area and got a  banh mi. The bread was okay, but not as crunchy as my go to spot, Dakao. The goodies in the sandwich was half as much as I'm used to seeing, and whats worse is that it cost more too.\u000a\u000aThis place is okay, but I'd rather drive a few more miles to Chinatown if you know what I Mean. With a lot more variety and options to choose from, save yourself the disappointment and wait until tou get to Spring Mountain. You'll be glad you did...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(312/365) "All Bread, Barely Any Filler"

One of the Ben & Jerry's flavors have been resurrected  from the ice cream graveyard of Ben & Jerry's Flavors!!!!\u000a\u000aWhite Russian is a flavor I would always get whenever I had the chance after first discovering it while going to Culinary school in New York. 1994 was the last time I remember having White Russian after Ben & Jerry's decided to discontinue it...:(\u000a\u000aFast Forward 20 years later, We make it over to The District at Green Valley and ecstatic to hear that people have spoken, and requested to bring back White Russian, so it is back by popular demand at all of the scoop shops in various Las Vegas locations. Get a taste if you're in the area, It is sooooooo good!!!

VAnother spot thats close to us, we've also been to their other locations as well, we always come here to suck down some rocks with a cold brewski and we always order their Lamb Chops(or Lollipops as I like to call 'em) medium rare, served with their addicting Honey Basil Sauce.\u000a\u000aThey also have daily specials, and the day that we were there, they had a special on the fish tacos which were pretty tasty. Clam strips were decent too. good food, so-so atmosphere...Give Shucks a try and see what you think...ALOHA!!!

Next time I'll stick tothe raw oysters...ALOHA!!!

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(181/365) "Kids Do The Darndest Things!?!?"\u000a\u000aWhen I hear Victoria's Secret, I immediately think bras, panties, lingerie, you know? Women's stuff...I had no idea they had a teeny tiny section for men's fragrances!?\u000a\u000aWhile Wifey was checking out some stuff, I  just dabbled in the Men's cologne area \u000awhich had about three different scents. Of all three, I liked Very Sexy Platinum one the best. Who knows? I may just return to pick up a bottle one day. The service here is pretty good up until you get to the cashier. Ladies try to get you to sign up for a credit card which can be pretty annoying.\u000a\u000aTip for parents with kids too...be with your child at all times, otherwise they may risk serious injury from LYING DOWN ON THE FLOOR when people are shopping!?!?!?

VWe used to frequent this place when we lived in Hendertucky, way before spots like Thelma's, Penn's, and Great Greek existed.\u000a\u000aThis was plan B after Great Greek had closed up shop due to selling out of food!?!?!(that's what we were told) We shared an Avgolemono, Wifey got the Chicken Gyro with Greek Fries, and I decided to go with the owner's suggestion of the Moussaka.\u000a\u000aThe Avgolemono was okay, but we preferred Great Greek's version better. However, we preferred the Gyro and fries here, even though the portion was a bit smaller, Greek Bistro still gets our vote. The seasoned fries with the yogurt dip are so addicting! The Moussaka came with a side salad and was very delicious and quite filling.\u000a\u000aGreek Bistro is a great alternative if Great Greek is closed for the day and you're craving some Greek grindage...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(19/100) "Greek Grindz"

VAs a venue usually for sporting events and concerts, the Thomas and Mack Center was tranformed for an evening as a place of worship when Mega-Pastor Joel Osteen was in town for "A Night of Hope"\u000a\u000aIf you've ever seen his program on TV(Sundays, 9am on Lifetime), its just 30 minutes and is really a fraction of what really goes on. Joel Osteen also comes to Vegas once about every 7 years, so this was a great experience to see him live. Familiar faces were also in the crowd-George Wallace, Frank Marino, Sigfried and Roy, and the place was PACKED!\u000a\u000aThe evening began with our National Anthem with one of the best worship teams I've ever heard, and throughout the night, messages of hope, grace, and inspiration by Joel Osteen's wife Victoria, mother Dolores, and brother Paul, along with his own message about faith versus fear combined with great song services made this two and a half hour service awesome, inspirational, and unforgettable...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(32/100) "A Family Affair with the Osteens"

Hells Yeah!!\u000a\u000aBUT.....\u000a\u000aI didn't have my Costco Card with me-CRAP!\u000a\u000aI was Hella starving, and how was I gonna pass the Costco lady at the entrance????\u000a\u000aAfter some serious thinking I decided to tell a little white li.....I mean,\u000a"April Fool's"(Yes, this occured on April 1st)\u000a\u000a"I need to"RENEW" my membership " I said.\u000a\u000a"Right this way Hun," The lady slides open the fence and pointed me towards the membership area, right next to the food area.\u000a\u000aas soon as she got back to the entrance, I made a "slight  detour"\u000aand I ordered up a Costco Combo....and it hit the spot!.....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aP.S.

VI LOVE me some Mediterranean Cuisine, it reminds me of my time spent back east hanging out with my Greek, Persian, Spanish, and Turkish friends and first being exposed to new ingredients and tasty cuisines for the first time. It also reminded me of my time spent at the Wine Spectator Restaurant at The Culinary Institute of America at Greystone where the menu items we made covered flavors from the Mediterranean Regions, from Paella, Moussaka, Dolmades, Kofta, and Skordalia, to Avgolemono, Lavash, Taramosalatta, Spanokopita, and Baklava we did a little of everything. Also taking Cooking courses with Mediterranean food authority and chef Joyce Goldstein was a great bonus.\u000a\u000aWifey's not as big as a fan as I am, so I kinda had to sorta beg and plead and twist her arm to check out Yassou Greek Grill Cafe since we were close by...(It worked!)\u000aYassou was a good find! Perusing the menu, I see Taramosalatta, a dip made from cured fish roe, potatoes, lemon juice and olive oil. I love that stuff and I order it as a starter."Whoa!?!?!? you even pronounced it correctly!?!?! Great choice!" The guy behind the register says with a surprised look...(Refer to above paragraph)\u000a\u000aWe also shared a Lemon Herb Chicken Pita and a Souvlaki Combo. The Taramosalatta arrives and we dig in. Yassou's version was okay, but I'm used to a stronger taste of the cured roe, and I didn't really taste the potato in there, more like overkill on the olive oil. Every bite of the pita was delicious as was the combo, but the beef skewer was a tad on the dry side. Overall, a solid meal, and I still have to try out a few other spots that were highly yelped (Paymon's, Zaytoon, Parsley, Great Greek, etc.) ALOHA!!!

Total for all of our produce? Only $3.50!!!!\u000aOn our way out, I also grabbed some apple and pear cider.......okay, okay, and another order of doughnuts too,,,\u000a\u000aAlready planning my menu as I was picking them in the orchard, we totally enjoyed the fried green tomatoes, deep fried squash blossoms, and squash blossom quesadillas for dinner!!!!

VEasy Life Boba is the only place (for now) that serves up Fluffy Snow Ice(if you wanna call it that) in Las Vegas.\u000a\u000aI will happily WAIT for good food done right\u000a\u000aI will happily PAY for good food done right\u000a\u000aWhen you fail to execute what you're selling and charge me out the yin-yang on top of it?\u000a\u000aHouston, we have a problem....\u000a\u000aSnow Factory in Hawaii does snow Ice like it should be(CHECK MY REVIEW AND PICTURES TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE), Fluff Ice does their fluff like it should be...Just like cotton candy....Fluffy in appearance, and melts in your mouth.\u000aI understand where people have an issue with the service. Longer than necesary wait times because your attention span is with your friends that came in to chat while you're on the time clock and not with the customers? How bout more training to put the FLUFF back in your product?\u000a\u000aWe ordered 2 small Fluffy Snow and a Boba Milk Tea which came out to just under $16...(Sm. $ 5.25, Lg. $7.25, Jumbo $ 9.25....WTF??? For Snow ice????)\u000a\u000aWe tried Thai Fluffy Snow with rice cake, tapioca, and condensed milk and the thai tea flavor was barely there. We also got Strawberry with mochi, bananas, and lychee jelly and condensed milk which they forgot to put. The straw that broke the camel's back was the texture. It wasn't fluffy at all, probably because all the toppings crushed the fluffy texture, kinda like when you take a nicely made cotton candy and smash the air out of it... and worse of all it was already melting....in an air conditioned room!?!?!? Honestly, this version is closer to shave ice and NOWHERE NEAR Snow Ice. Might as well catch Snow Ono for some bomb-ass Shave Ice and still have some $$$ in your wallet, seriously.\u000a\u000aI had Fluff Ice at The Las Vegas Foodie Fest 3 times OUTDOORS and it didn't melt as fast!?!?!?\u000a\u000aYelpers, you have been warned, so if you go here to try it and come out disappointed, or thinking that its not all that, I don't blame you, you aren't getting snow ice like how it should be...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(234/365)-"Liquid Cotton Candy?

VThis is the first place we came for Pupusas when we first moved here 6 years ago and to this day we still pop in on occasion for a pupusa fix...\u000a\u000awe also tried their "cheeseless" nachos, carne asada, chicken encebollado, and their casamiento(Salvadoran Breakfast) which are pretty good as well. Their Pupusas are their "claim to fame" \u000akinda like a hot pocket but only a thousand times better, these bad boys are huge, addicting, and doesn't break the bank, even better when they're cooked nice and crisp with burnt oozing cheese around the edges.\u000a\u000aTheir horchata is my drink of choice, slightly diiferent from the mexican version(Salvadoran style is made with toasted rice) My wife always gets the ensalada, kinda like a pineapple agua fresca with bits of apple inside. Think its almost time to pay Las Pupusas another visit...ALOHA!!!

VSo we've always brought Dolce to Petsmart(Henderson) for his monthly grooming with no problems at all, and now we live in the northwest, boy was this location totally the opposite.....\u000a\u000aFor those of you who have seen and met Dolce, our lil' chewbacca,  he is a fur ball, but a very well-maintained fur ball. Anyway, this little snot Liz, has me sign the necessary papers and whatnot, lets me know when Dolce will be ready, etc. so when I leave Petsmart, the grooming place calls me after 5 minutes and Liz says "Oh, we just found out that Dolce's hair is all matted on the bottom because of his thick double coat, so he would have to be shaved, because he would be in pain if we tried to brush him out after his bath"\u000a\u000aAin't that a load of BS??????? So I head back in to take Dolce back  and leave totally upset because I knew damn well this liitle snot just didn't feel like doing the job she applied for....Nothing was wrong with Dolce's coat  because we brush him out at least once a week. That's cool, I don't need their "selective service" anyway...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aComing Up:\u000aBark Place Grooming Salon

VSorry Fat Greek, you look like the Skinny Greek compared to Kabob Korner's Super Gyro and the Chicken Gyro Pita which was what I ordered when we stopped in after Artifice.\u000a\u000aI  could barely grab my pita with both hands because this thing was super stuffed, I ended up using a knife and fork because it was too huge to pick up and take a bite. It was very tasty, and I'm looking forward to returning to try the Super Gyro...ALOHA!!!

Savory, sweet, cookies, cakes, and pastries...we tried a cream filled eclair looking pastry, and a picked up some of those thin almond cookies which were pretty good. We didn't have too much time, but I'd like to return to sample some other stuff.\u000a\u000aMaybe on the next visit...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(148/365) "Korean Style Goodies"

VNo relation to Penn and Teller, or UFC fighter BJ Penn, We finally made it to Penn's Thai House after church when we were in the area. We were reluctant at first because of wifey's first visit a few years back when we lived in the Hendertucky area where she popped in to get some take out and found the restaurant empty with a worker crashed out in one of the booths.\u000a\u000aMaybe they've switched owners or cleaned up their act because its been creating a little buzz on Yelp. We started off with the Thai style Beef Jerky which was pretty tasty. Thai Thai Iced Tea was perfectly refreshing too.\u000a\u000aNext came our Pad thai and Panang Curry. The Panang Curry was good with a slight kick, but a tad too sweet for my liking. I also wished some veggies were included. Our Pad Thai was also good, but was missing the crushed peanuts and lime like I'm used to seeing.This ain't LOS or Komol, but pretty solid food overall, and a plus if you're on this side of town...ALOHA!!!

VPart 3 of our evening ended up at the South Point Bowling Center. This is one of the nicer ones in town(The nicest being Red Rock IMO) Lots of lanes, good amount of seating, and relatively clean.\u000a\u000aThere were about 14 of us, and it came out to $10 a person for shoe rental and two games which wasn't bad at all. This was a great way to end our evening...fun, low key, and drama free! I'm not a competitive bowler, nor a good one, but I'm just happy to have scored over 100 both games!\u000a\u000aBeing open 24 hours is another plus here, so you can come knock 'em down any time of the day, or night.   ALOHA!!!

VWe finally got to try Rachel's Kitchen one afternoon, and we were quite pleased with our first visit.\u000a\u000aWe shared a BBQ Chicken Wrap, Protein Scramble and an Islander Smoothie. The portions were pretty good size, and the sweet potato fries that came with the wrap were done to perfection. Quality ingredients, no shortcuts here.\u000a\u000aThe smoothie was very refreshing and naturally sweet...a perfect complement to our lunch. The service was awesome, and workers were very helpful with any questions we had.\u000a\u000aDefinitely returning to try other items from their MASSIVE menu!

VThings happen for a reason....and on the way home from work, I stop by Dakao to get some Grilled Chicken and BBQ Beef banh mi for dinner, and the question always is...how many do I get? At first I ordered 4 banh mi, then this lady next to me says " you should buy 1 more and get 1 more free" pointing to their buy 5 get 1 free deal.\u000a\u000aAfter some thinking, i figure with 6, I could have 1 banh mi during the drive home because I can easily kill 4 of these bad boys in 1 sitting. So I go for the deal. As my order is being made, I see three different customers get baguettes, so I ask the lady "How much do you sell your baguettes"  "one dollar" She replies. I love their crusty, chewy baguttes and have never had an old or stale one in any of my visits here. Next time I make pasta, or a meat and cheese platter, I can grab a couple of loaves from here.\u000a\u000aOn the drive home, I come to a stoplight and as I proceed to take a bite out of my BBQ Beef banh mi, I see out of the corner of my eye a sign getting closer that says "ANYTHING HELPS"  If there is anything I hate, its to see a person\u000ago hungry. I didn't have any spare change, but I did have 6 hot banh mi. So quickly before the light turns green, I get this young mans attention, roll down my window, and I say 'Here you go brother, Take Care" Handing him a banh mi. "Thank You SO MUCH, I appreciate it!" He replied. Just the look on his face made me feel like I had won the lottery. I was happy knowing that he didn't have to go hungry for another night.\u000a\u000aThings REALLY DO happen for a reason......ALOHA!!!

Mornings here are a complete madhouse! line in the store, regulars picking up their usual, kinda like a Starbucks in the morning, but instead of coffee and pastries, its coffee and banh mi...\u000a\u000aLooking forward to try their version of Iced coffee which looked good and I'm sure alot better than Lee's "ICE with 3 sips of coffee" Also on another visit, grabbed baguettes to make some Panzanella(Bread Salad) and a cheese platter...at a buck each, they're cheap, and taste great!

VWe FINALLY made it to The Bagel Cafe in search of a breakfast spot we had never been to. Why the heck did it take us so long!?!?!? Better late than never, right?\u000a\u000aThis place was packed when we stepped inside, but luckily for us, a booth was waiting with our name on it which was great because I'm not much of a fan sitting at open tables in the middle of the dining room of a . Talk about selection here!!! People really look like they're reading the Sunday Paper! That's how extensive their menu is...our waitress checked back on three different occasions laughing because we were kinda overwhelmed on deciding what to get.\u000a\u000aI knew I wanted a bagel, and it'll almost always be an Everything Bagel with Nova Spread. \u000aWifey wanted a cup of their popular Matzo Ball soup(which was also a first for me, I think)\u000aand the Challah French Toast. Along with my bagel, I had to have a Potato Pancake with sour cream and apple sauce, and I've never had a Knish, so I added one of their meat and potato ones. The Matzo Ball Soup was very good, and my bagel was as I imagined-nicely toasted and chewy like a NY bagel. The Nova spread was pretty bomb too. The Potato Pancake was simple, straightforward, and delicious. Something in the flavor of the Knish was kinda foreign to me, and after 2-3 bites, I was done with that...At least I didn't knock it before I tried it! Wifey also failed to read that the soup came with a bagel, so she chose a Cinnamon-Raisin Bagel with cinnamon-raisin cream cheese which we enjoyed. The French Toast arrived and this plate looked like it came from Hash House A Go-Go!?\u000a\u000aBigger doesn't necessarily mean better IMO....all I could taste was egg, egg, and more egg. The challah wasn't soaked enough either. A little cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla extract does wonders! Overall, it was a great first visit. Tasty food, great service, and a great local spot to start your morning....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cu   4.25\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(37/365) "A Taste Of New York In The Desert"

VEN, you've certainly gone downhill ever since the Mon Group(Sushi Mon-Maryland Parkway, Sushi House Goyemon,Monta Ramen) let you go...yeah, you've kept things like potato corn and foie gras custard with cold noodles, but the quality is just not there, it's at RAKU(Chef Endo was one of the opening chefs)\u000a\u000aWe also shared the tempura dinner, robata dinner, and I was curious to try the Monkey Special after some food critic raved about it in the Las Vegas Weekly...Tempura was just like any other joint that serves tempura, the Robata dinner was good, with the exception of the Salmon and Chicken Breast-way too dried out.\u000a\u000aThe Monkey Special-tempura fried plantain slices topped with imitation crabmeat, tuna, and drizzled with yum yum sauce and unagi glaze had a pretty good flavor, but would have been even better if it would have had REAL crabmeat...What a shame...once, a cool place to enjoy awesome food, now, just okay for me...ALOHA!!!

VLike most food, you would have to have been raised on or grew up with it to really like or appreciate it...\u000a\u000aSuch is the case, with Jolibee's Fried Chicken. Just about every table had one, so the wifey and I decided to share a plate to see what all the hype was about, and I also got a peach pie because it really looked like how the old school deep fried apple pies Mc Donald's used to have waaaay back in the day(STILL searching for that to this day)\u000a\u000aHow was the chicken? The Colonel still kicks the Bee's A$$....IMHO\u000a\u000aHow was the pie? Close but no cigar....ALOHA!!!

VJun's is one of those many places that caters to Hawaiian transplants and is pretty decent for their Korean BBQ, just like home.\u000a\u000aYou can't go wrong with Jun's Special-Kalbi, Bugolgi, Meat Jun,BBQ Chicken and Mandoo. The option of Brown Rice is sweet too.\u000a\u000aThey're also generous on their banchan selections and even serve Hawaiian Sun Drinks.\u000a\u000aIf you're on this side of town, definitely give Jun's a try...ALOHA!!!

VThis was our first time here after living in Vegas for 7 years and we had a great time. Loved seeing the arts and crafts, as well as the people dressed up in costumes, kinda like an Electric Daisy Carnival block party. The Dancetronauts provided bangin' beats shortly after the burning of Unlucky Lucy, Sidewalk singers lined the streets hoping to make some green, and there was even a cipher on the street corner where poppers and b-boys were doing their thing.\u000a\u000aWhat is up with these groups of emo-ish looking kids shuffling like there's no tomorrow??? Everywhere the youngins' were, there was at least 2 or 3 kids looking like they were straight outta LMFAO's Party Rock Anthem video! Well, I can't hate on that, because when I was their age popping, uprocking, doing windmills and backspins,\u000aolder people would have the same reaction and think "What's that nonsense their doing on the ground???" At least they're staying out of touble. The classic cars and lowrider bikes were a cool sight to see, as well as the food selections from food trucks, to kettle corn, corn on the cob, and baked corn, there was something for everyone. We were headed for some street tacos at Taqueria El Pastorcito after the festivities, so we passed up the vendors here.\u000a\u000aOne thing we didn't pass up though is the vendor with  the HUMANGOUS smoked turkey legs. He was looking to get rid of them before nights end. Tasty caramelization on the outside, VERY juicy and smokey on the inside, best turkey legs ever...Better than Disneyland, The Renaissance Fair, or any other festival I've been to. If you wait until the last hours of First Friday, you can get 'em for just $5!!!!....ALOHA!!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(191/365) "First Timer at First Friday"

VWe returned to First Friday recently, and it was still pretty hot, amazingly we didn't eat any hot foods. It was just cool treats the whole time we were there! Sasapops, Pinkberry, and Snow Ono kept us cool as we checked out the cool artwork and came across an awesome group of cars in honor of 9/11...Thank goodness it'll cool down in a couple of months, so heat won't be such an issue, and people can enjoy First Friday better...ALOHA!!!!

VLast time we came here, dirt and gravel parking lots, and unpaved walkways.....fast forward 5 years later, this place has actually made a big improvement!\u000a\u000aBig paved parking lot, clean paved walkways, and now featuring entertainment on the big stage.\u000a\u000aYes, like every Swap Meet/outdoor market, aisles will seem repetitive at times, but its cool people watching, and browsing cool stuff while munching on roasted peanuts. Passing the Luchadore masks, Cow's Hoof Bottle Holders, and the guy roasting chiles and veggies so people can purchase them for soups and salsa, we come across a stand serving Cerveza Preperada, or Micheladas.\u000a\u000aWe've never tried one before, and this version was made with clamato, lime juice, and rimmed with carne asada seasoning. Lots of people were ordering this, so we thought we'd give it a try. For me, it was okay with an interesting taste, but not something I would order again.\u000a\u000aAll this walking worked up our appetite, so we called it a day at Broadacres\u000aand searched for a lunch spot....ALOHA!!!

VNow that the weather's getting warmer, its a great time make your way out to the Broadacres Marketplace and Events Center. Admission is $.50 on Fridays, $1.00 on Saturdays, and $1.50 on Sundays.\u000a\u000aWe come here at least once a year, and it kinda reminds me of the San Jose Flea Market but on a smaller scale. Its all about the thrill of the hunt here. Lookin' for some S@#t kickers? they got 'em....more BOOM in your system? they have those too. Ladies...need some junk in your trunk??? Levanta Pompis(Push up your A$$) AKA Booty Jeans are here for your Badonkadonk! For the Kiddies, they got toys galore and horse rides that are way cooler than the coin operated type rides, tons of power tools\u000avarious home accents, and cool art can also be found by Dave the Artist. Victoria's Secret? On sale here too.\u000a\u000aEntertainment varies week-to-week, and this time, Banda Rivera was onstage entertaining the crowd.\u000aFoodwise, there's something for everyone here...fresh and exotic produce like Cherimoya and Mamey Sapote can be found here. Snacks like Churros, Chicharrones, Takislocos, Cocolocos, and Mariscocos are a local favorite, and you can also get burgers, hot dogs BBQ, and even Thai food here. pick up some roasted chiles for soups and salsas from the gangster at the El Tostado stand(see photo, he's flashing a gang sign!) also stop by the peanut vendor with the five wheel barrows for a sample of some tasty roasted peanuts done in four different styles. Go early enough to avoid parking hassles and bail by noon before it gets too hot and you'll have wallked\u000aenough to work up an appetite for lunch...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(208/365) "Trash Or Treasures?"

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(173/365) "Takin' A Break At Broadacres"\u000a\u000aAwesome spot to find some cool deals, tasty treats, listen to live entertainment, and great people watching too!\u000a\u000aIts only $1.50 to get in on the weekends and if you've got enough patience, you can score certain items at dirt cheap prices that you may pay for double or triple outside.\u000aWith warmer temperatures, you can cool down with  Micheladas or aguas frescas, snack on a tasty Cocoloco, Churro, or Gordita. Guys, If you need to get your hair did, there's also a Barbershop inside.\u000a\u000aOne of my favorite things to get is the roasted peanuts here which are so cheap and very addicting. Taco Tijuana fans will be happy to know that they have a location in the events center too! I was also on the hunt for a burner for a paella pan that I'm still waiting to break in, but sadly, no luck....still a great place to spend the day!

VBerry Blendz is another great spot in our area.  Lots to choose from here, and their smoothie selections seem tempting, but I quickly narrowed it down to the Acai Bowl.\u000a\u000aIt was pretty good, but I just wish it had more strawberries and bananas instead of granola, but thats just my personal preference. Will definitely return to try their smoothie selections...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(38/100) "Jamba's Cousin"

VFlying in from Cancun, It was great to be back home in the US, and I was hungry as  usual after only having a $15 burger at Johnny Rockets at Cancun Airport 6 hours earlier...\u000a\u000aWe were planning to wait until we got to Las Vegas to grab a bite because we only had a 1 1/2 hour layover. I couldn't wait, so I walked around and came upon this place.\u000a\u000aafter browsing their menu, I decided on their Polish Sausage with onions and peppers...put some mustard on that bad boy and chowed down.\u000a\u000aIt was pretty good and I enjoyed the snap of the casing, the smokiness of the sausage and the sweetness of the onions and peppers.\u000a\u000aIts a good thing I got a quick bite because our 1 1/2 hour layover turned into 3 hours by the time we got to Vegas because of a mechanical problem detected before we took off causing everyone to de-plane, go to another gate at another terminal re-board, etc....ALOHA!!!

VChecked this place out due to the majority of high reviews on Yelp. It was pretty warm out, and we were looking to cool off, so we just ordered drinks and passed on the eats.\u000a\u000aWe are always up for trying new stuff, So Wifey ordered a Grape Slush kinda drink, and instead of going for an Avocado Boba Smoothie, one of my usuals, I ask for their most popular one, which the girl behind the counter says is their Peach Perfection, so I go with that. Wifey's Grape smoothie was disgustingly fake artificial tasting, and I had never had difficulty with a boba drink until now. \u000a\u000aThe peach smoothie part was okay, but when its boba drinks, I feel I enjoy them more when I order Asian/Tropical Fruit flavors(Taro, Avocado, Milk Tea, Coconut, Lychee, Mango, etc.), and I enjoy citrus, berry, and stone fruit flavors(Orange, Strawberry, Blueberry, Peach, etc.) more when I'm in the mood for Jamba Juice or Tropical Smoothie Cafe...just a personal preference, I guess\u000a\u000aThose boba straws are big for a reason, but getting those pearls up the straw was like getting Augustus Gloop up that pipe in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory! They cooked the pearls a tad too much and they expanded a few millimeters too much.My cheeks were getting sore and I felt like I was going blue in the face like Violet Beauregard!\u000a\u000aNeedless to say, the trash cans looked hungry, so we fed them, and we continued our search to cool off....No. 1 Boba and Icy Juicy still get my boba vote...ALOHA!!!

VWe've been wanting to try this spot for the longest time, and I must say, We were very impressed!\u000a\u000aAfter reading mixed reviews by a few of my friends on Yelp and watching the ATC video with Rosemary and the rest of the staff, we decided to give ATC a shot and decide for ourselves. As we enter, Rosemary and another Bulgarian gentleman (didn't get his name) is there to greet us.\u000a\u000aWe mentioned that it was our first time there, and as she mentions in the video, they are known for their deep dish pizza, so our lunch was already decided. She also said that the 50-year old oven they use and the Pizza Maker came from Chicago. How Much more authentic can you get? We entrusted Rosemary who has been there over 5 years and is a local from Chicago as well, and went with her suggestions- no more than 5 toppings, and we went with what she suggested:\u000aSuasage, Pepperoni, Ricotta, Garlic, and the MUST HAVE Hot Giardinera Peppers. Already knowing about the 45 minute wait, Rosemary Suggested the Fried Ravioli which was a great starter.Crisp outside, creamy Ricotta inside and a chiffonade of basil sprinkled on top, went very well with the warm marinara.\u000a\u000aOur pizza arrives, and Rosemary serves up our first slices. First bite, flavor explosions in my mouth! The SWEET hand crushed tomatoes, creamy ricotta, meaty sausage, whole roasted garlic cloves, crispy pepperoni, and the mild heat of the giardinera all worked together in harmony with the crisp, buttery crust...this is the only way I'll have my stuffed pizza...Rosie's way! Now THAT'S  Amore!!!!....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(282/365) "Chi-Town Pie"

VCool little shop to stop by and grab a few sweets if you're in the area. I've tried a few of Payard's sweets which are pretty good, and the Macarons are like Doritos...you can never just have one.\u000a\u000aAs Payard is a pastry legend, he can also hold his own on the savory side. I have yet to try some of his offerings, and sit down and dine there. Looks like a future Sunday Brunch spot soon!...ALOHA!!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(310/365) "Sweet & Savory"

VCame here for Sunday Brunch and it was packed because it was Mother's Day, and the only available seats were at the bar, so we were sat up there. This is another place that feels like home and the staff are always friendly and welcoming\u000a\u000aI will be totally honest and say that I prefer sticking to the Sunday Brunch offerings and not so much their AYCE Sushi items. Flat out, the quality is just not as fresh as it should be, and I could really tell the difference as I have consumed a few thousand pieces here in Vegas alone.(True story!!!) That first order of nigiri was our last, and I just told the Chef that we were\u000asticking to the brunch stuff.\u000a\u000aHe didn't seem too enthused about it, but hey, I ain't taking that kind of risk. I can't believe others at the bar eating sushi didn't detect that pretty sketchy quality. Anyway, back to the brunch items. We killed a good number of items from the whole list of offerings, like\u000a\u000aIsland Sushi Roll\u000a008 Roll\u000aRed Velvet Pancakes X4\u000aHawaiian Sweet Bread French Toast X2\u000aEgg in a Basket with Bacon\u000aKim Chee Clam Dip with Malassada Chips\u000aTempura Green Beans with Wasabi Nori Ranch\u000aCold Ginger Chicken with Cilantro Pesto\u000aChicken Curry Salad on malassada Chip\u000aKim Chee and Lup Cheong Fried Rice\u000aGrilled Mongolian Beef Tips\u000aCrispy Pork Belly Bun\u000aGreen Tea Tiramisu\u000aVanilla Creme Brulee\u000aCocoa Puff\u000aMalassada with Passionfruit Cream\u000aCucumber and Melon Granita\u000a\u000aAll plates are tapas portions, and you can order as little or as many as you like.\u000aSadly, the Cocoa Puff and Malassada kina come up short and I goitta wait to go home for the real deal at Leonard's and Liliha....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(261/365) "Sunday Brunch Bash"

VBest Frozen Yogurt in town....none of these other imposters(U-Swirl, Golden Spoon, Pink Berry, Yogurtland,etc...) even come close to the quality of Red Mango. Red Mango uses the finest quality Ingredients, and not powders like some of these wannabe yogurt shops...My favorite is their Tangomonium piled high with fresh strawberries, pineapple, and mango. Their hibiscus tea is Bomb too. If you enjoy building your own and choosing from endless powder based flavors, \u000ago ahead, knock yourselves out....If you want somthing more healthy, nutritious, and 100 times better for the kids, this is the only place to go...ALOHA!!!

Not only do they play Rock en Espanol, but they also throw in some Depeche Mode and Beastie Boys among others, which is cool and keeps the crowd happy. 4 stars for the band alone...\u000a\u000aother than that, everything else aint all that unless you enjoy the meat market/douchey/guidoesque vibe.....ALOHA!!!

VFinally got to try this place and I've definitely become a fan!  We got some kinda flatbread with cheese to start which was good, we also ordered the homemade lemonade that I really enjoyed because the owner Amir blends mint into the lemonade which totally tasted like a mojito without the alcohol.\u000awe also ordered the combo plate(Falafel, Hummus, Beef Shawerma, Chicken Shawerma, and a side salad) \u000a\u000aWe also shared the Shnetzel Plate which came with fries and a side salad\u000a\u000aWe definitely enjoyed the Falafel, Pita, Hummus, and salad, but the Beef and Chicken Shawerma were kinda dry and not like other shawerma I've enjoyed before. Unfortunately for the Shnetzel.....dry too. Their sweets were pretty good and we bought more pita and falafel mix to cook up at home.\u000a\u000aWe'll be back, but  probably just to stock up on more falafel and pita...ALOHA!!!

VWhat better way to kick off the New Year by reviewing another local business!?\u000aAlso, since Yelp only allows you to rate 1-5stars and nothing in between, I've come up with a "Shaka-Meter" where it allows 0-10 Shakas ..\u005cuuu/...and everything in between!\u000a\u000aSo we were in the area and have always passed Great Links, but this time, we stopped in for a bite. Locally owned and run, staff makes you feel at home. We split the Vegas Chili Dog and I got the Pastrami Cheeseburger. Wifey got a Bacon Cheeseburger and  we both got some delicious Death Valley Root Beer on tap! Woooohooo!!!\u000a\u000aThe burgers were okay, just too well done for my taste, but the star was the Vegas Chili Dog. I love the snap you get from each bite! We plan to return, but unless they cook burgers to a desired temperature, I'll just go down the hot dog side of the menu, or maybe even choose from the wide variety of menu items they have.   ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka-Meter: \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuu   3.5\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(1/365) "Wassup Dog!?!?"

VHaven't had Retro for a long time, so I decided to swing by and do a little "taste test".\u000aThere are many cupcake shops here in town, and Retro is a popular favorite among locals.\u000a\u000aWe tried the Maple Bacon, Coffee and Doughnuts, Cotton Candy, and Milk & Cookies.\u000aThese have cool names and all, but the buttercream tends to be on the overly sweet side,(at least for me) and on a couple of the cupcakes, it wasn't as moist as I was expecting. Totally still a fan though, and I love the fact that they are in my hood! ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(323/365) "Retro Rocks!"

VCame here for a quick bite and shared the Bruschetta Sampler, Bisteca Salad, and a Fettuccine dish that was a couple minutes shy of al dente...\u000a\u000aLuckily the Italian peach tea helped me wash the pasta down. The dessert tray didn't look appetizing, so we passed on the sweets.\u000a\u000aNext time we're in the area, I'd rather dine at Yard House instead...ALOHA!!!

VCame here after avoiding the chaos next door at Cafe Moda. We ordered\u000aWonton Soup, the Stir Fried Beef, and the Shanghai Dumplings as suggested by our waitress.\u000a\u000aThe wonton soup was okay, and the beef was good, but got overly sweet with every bite. The dumplings are flavorful, but greasy as well.\u000aOverall, just okay for me, as there are other joints in the area that serve up food that's just as tasty. Too much hype? Maybe.....Would I come back? Not so sure.....ALOHA!!!

VWifey received a tip from a co-worker on this place, so we thought of giving this place a try instead of stopping at Mario's for our Catfish/Turkey Neck fix which is close by.\u000a\u000aThis is a really tight spot filled with two and four tops, so coming here with five or more people will probably end up in a longer wait than usual. We split the Big Breakfast of Chicken(or your choice of Fried Catfish) and Waffles, two eggs, and grits(first grits topping is free) and we also split The Rich Boy(AKA Shrimp Po' Boy) which came with 8 crisp, juicy shrimp, lettuce, tomato, and their special sauce on a toasted hoagie roll.\u000a\u000aThe chicken was good(all chicken wings) but I still like the fried chicken from Kathy's\u000aand the waffle was so-so. I have yet to find a good place in Vegas that has solid chicken and waffles(still have to try Skinnyfats' version) but the Rich Boy was very delicious and I'd return for that sandwich again. \u000a\u000aGive Gritz Caf a go, and see if its good enough to slap yo' momma!    ALOHA!!!

VWent in on a Tuesday night with high expectations after yelpers and co-workers raved about this place.....\u000a\u000aWe decided to sit up at the bar and check out the action up close. We were greeted by the two sushi chefs that night. One of them was Guy, soft spoken, looked like a local Hawaiian dude, and the other chef was this Japanese dude\u000awith hair parted in the center and a mole dead center of his forehead. From here on out, he'll be known as "JD"(Japanese dude)\u000a\u000aSo for round 1, we order some nigiri- hamachi, salmon, uni, garlic tuna, and unagi. Our orders come up, but we still have no plates, chopsticks, wasabi, or ginger....."My bad, " says a server" I'll get you some right away" Finally when we get squared away with our attack gear, we dig in.  All the seafood tasted fresh and good but THE SUSHI RICE WAS AL DENTE?!?!?!?!\u000a\u000aPasta and Risotto yes, but not sushi rice!!!!!  Most reviews on this place highlight their "minimal rice and more seafood" ratio, especially the nigiri sushi, but what good is it if the rice isn't done right? \u000a\u000aPeople also seem to be thrilled at the fact that you can order anything on the menu except for sashimi, but why would you pay for AYCE sushi and get filled up on  a salad, bento box, or noodles? \u000a\u000aAlready off to a sketchy start, we decide to order some side dishes and wait until the batch of crappy rice is done, so  we order some shrimp and vegetable tempura, baked mussels, and I ask about hamachi kama(Grilled yellowtail collar) and the waitress informs me that they do have it, but its not included in AYCE.....WTH???????\u000a\u000athe sides were okay, but we came here to get our sushi on. By this time there was a different batch of rice, so we order a couple of different half rolls- the volcano, jojo's poki roll, and the helmet roll.\u000aThe Volcano was tasty, the helmet was okay, but the poki roll wasn't\u000apoki at all, just a mix of diced tuna, onion and ocean salad?!?!?!WTH?????\u000a\u000aAt this point, my tea cup is ice cold and takes me forever to flag two different workers just to get a refill of hot green tea, which they also charge $2.75, while its complimentary at other sushi bars.\u000a\u000aI'm also starting to build a barrcade of plates between me and the lady eating next to me, hoping it doesn't go TIMBER! like a chopped tree, but  the sushi keeps coming, this time from JD.\u000a\u000awe order more nigiri and some handrolls-amaebi, fresh scallop, ikura, white tuna, and the baked fantasy roll...We also ask JD if he can do a tempura broccoli and avocado hand roll for Sylvia, and my favorite salmon skin hand roll for me. So JD hands a poorly constructed handroll to Sylvia looking like its ready to fall apart before even taking a bite, and my salmon skin hand roll is dripping unagi sauce from the bottom. Maybe he needs to go get lessons from Jin and Ynot from Blue Fin or Jesse and Jimbo from Sin City on how to make a proper hand roll because JD's skills are pretty lacking, or maybe its his stale sense of humor that had other patrons saying "what did he say?"... Not a very personable dude who had a lot of people lost in translation. After the hideous handrolls, we(actually, I) continue with more nigiri, repeating orders of hamachi, salmon, scallop, white tuna and unagi...\u000a\u000aWhile the wifey has tapped out and wanting to try something different, I decided to put JD to the test.....at this time, he's assuming I'm ready for dessert....\u000a\u000aJD: "Dessert ?"\u000a\u000aMe: "nope, Sushi"\u000a\u000aJD:"Still!?!?!?"\u000a\u000aMe: "Yup, All you can eat, right?" "What do you suggest?" "do you have any special items or creations you like to make?"\u000a\u000aJD:"Nigiri, or Roll?"\u000a\u000aMe:"You're the sushi chef, I'll leave it up to you....Surprise me"\u000a\u000aMost sushi chefs like the idea of a challenge, surprising customers\u000awith their custom creations, but with JD, it was like pulling teeth, and instead of rising to the challenge, he had these additional remarks...\u000a\u000aJD:(pointing to me and telling Sylvia)\u000a"This guy, no limit, huh?"\u000a"Just like Kobayashi" (former competitive eating champion)\u000a"Man, we lose money tonight"\u000a\u000aSo after all his ranting, what was his "surprise????"\u000aHe hands me an order of tuna nigiri-WEAK!!!!!\u000aUnimpressed by his antics, I order a tempura fried ice cream for dessert.   \u000aMeanwhile, he's scraping all the fatty goodness of the Tuna skin and throws it in the garbage.\u000awhips up about 3 orders of negitoro looking sushi....hands one order to the guys watching sports....hands the second order to the couple to his right , and hands the third order to the couple on his left...completely passes me up...pretty childish....He probably watched my time like a hawk, and/or didn't want to lose any more money.\u000aLike he watched my time, I watched his every little move behind the bar.\u000aOne of the couples asked "Wow, what was that you just gave us, it was delicious!\u000aJD goes back to the trash can, retrieves the piece of tuna skin, shows them, drops it back in the trash then takes a sip of wine..YUCK! Luckily I was on dessert...ALOHA!

V45 cent wings on tuesdays???yes please!!!! Salt and vinegar is my favorite for the dry wings, and Garlic Parm and Asian Zing for the wet. Mango Habanero used to be  another one of our selections, but lately, we can't even finish the order. They must've jacked up the Habanero and put less mango,.....Hmmmmmmmm....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000a(YELP 365 CHALLENGE-38/365) "Buffaloes have wings!?!?"

VWe hurried next door cause we were hella hungry and needed to get away from the dirty mop bucket smell.\u000a\u000aThe concept is cool here-customized burgers and shakes with tons of choices to have it your way with one exception. If you like pink in your meat, that ain't gonna happen. \u000aMedium is the lowest they can go. The beef itself was good though, but the bun was very questionable-very nicely toasted but cold???\u000a\u000aGet your free 1/2 Bob(half fries, half onion rings) using your Yelp Check-in.\u000aI got two words for you...Dispensary Lounge...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(325/365) "Custom Burgs and Shakes"

VWe gathered here for El Nino's birthday bash and this is most definitely one of Vegas' FORMER best kept secrets...\u000a\u000awe kinda-sorta took over the bar area(2 big tables) during Happy Hour(6pm)-and we pretty much closed the place down(9:30-10ish) so we definitely took advantage of the 50% off tapas from 6-8pm and 75% off from 8-close and 50% off steak entrees.\u000a\u000awe started off with some Bacon Wrapped Dates and a Buratta and Heirloom Tomato Salad tapas special of the evening. I didn't partake in any of their hand crafted cocktails either because I'm more of a beer and wine person that'll have an occasional mojito or sangria, but my drink of choice this evening was H2O on the rocks with a twist of lemon.\u000a\u000aAs 8pm drew near, we placed our orders. I got repeat orders of the dates and the Buratta special again cause they were both bomb diggits! I was eyeing the bone-in Ribeye for my entree, but seeing that Tony and Paolo were chowin down on the ribeyes, I had to get their feedback, which was "okay"....no sale for me, so instead, I chose the 8oz. Filet Mignon\u000awith Mac and Cheese and Broccolini. Wifey ordered a 12oz slab of Prime Rib with Mashed Potatoes and Asparagus. Nins decided to stick with tapas and pulled a "one of everything" kinda deal...while waiting for our entrees, Nins' tapas orders started crowding the table, so we did the right thing and"helped him out" so they wouldn't get cold. Faves for me were the bacon wrapped dates, buratta special, and surprisingly the stuffed piquillo peppers....then,what has got to be one of the bomb ass bread baskets in town arrive(and dissappear within minutes) Herb and Cheese Lavash,Honey Pecan, Soft Pretzel, and a "Nipply" soft roll, I'd gladly pay for the next basket...yes they're that good.\u000a\u000aThe house salad was tasty and refreshing too. the portion size could have easily passed for an entree.The balsamic vinaigrette was perfectly balanced and that "mystery tasting ingredient" in the salad turned out to be the green, non-functional garnish that usually gets pushed to the side-good old parsley. Our entrees arrived, and the wifey's prime rib was HUGE and looked good, but unfortunately was a little more rare than medium rare, and fell a little short on taste. My little 8oz. filet showed that big things do come in little packages. Although way smaller than the prime rib, it was huge on taste and quality-LIKE BUTTA!!! and the cajun crust on top and the perfct doneness that I requested was spot on. At the end of our meal, our server, who was also our bartender, saw that the prime rib was still there took it upon himself and made sure the wifey was pleased with her meal. What does he do? Comes back with another filet mignon...talk about service!\u000a\u000aMost definitely a place to hit up if you're ever in the area. Great food, awesome service, and definitely saves you some green...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(2/365) Happy Birthday Nins!

VThis is an update that happened just THREE days after the Trick R' Yelp Elite event...\u000a\u000aAfter a stellar evening by the kitchen and service staff where they put out a killer spread(See Trick R' Yelp reviews) We went back on Saturday evening\u000afor Happy Hour assuming we were in for another great evening since we've always had awesome experiences during our five previous visits at Twin Creeks...\u000a\u000aOn this night however, the kitchen staff and our server and her food runners\u000aCOMPLETELY SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!\u000a\u000a-Kitchen crew sent out our Bacon Wrapped Dates without crumbled blue cheese...to the cook in charge of putting that dish together, the chef expiditing all the plates before leaving the kitchen, and our sarcastic server(who was bitchy all night after we sent the dates back to be properly done)...ALL OF YOU couldn't see that there was something missing? you only serve hundreds of those every week!?!?!?\u000a\u000aSound like I'm making a big deal out of it? tables around us didn't have blue cheese on their dates either, (they were first time diners). So we order another round of tapas and our orders get delivered to ANOTHER TABLE!?!?\u000a\u000aWe order the Seafood Parpadelle to share, which comes with a salad AND their bomb-ass bread basket. Our salad goes to another table, back to the kitchen, then finally to our table...The mussels in the parpadelle were borderline jerky, just like those I've had at Firefly on Sahara(NASTY!)\u000aOur server's excuse for the mess ups?..."Everyone is tweaked out on Red Bulls by this time of the week...Sorry!"\u000aand that bread basket????Never made it to our table....Minus 1 Star for the sucky food that night, minus 1 star for the sucky and sarcastic service we recieved...ALOHA!!!

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(183/365) "Hangin' Tough With The Wifey"\u000a\u000aWe've attended a few events here and most recently, for the New Kids on the Block Concert. Yes, I was one of the 10% of males that attended. It was crazy inside!\u000a\u000aWe had pretty good seating but for people seated at the very left or right, they had a crappy side view of the show. It was hilarious to see die hard fans rockin' the 80's look with high hair, florescent clothes, and decked out in NKOTB gear. Seated in section 104, we had a perfect spot for the show. NKOTB performed their more recent hits mixed in with hits of other stars, and of course their hits of the 80s which totally brought me back to my high school years. Surprisingly, the age range for attendees were in the teens to 50-somethings!\u000a\u000aFelt sorry for the women who dragged their men out for the concert because there were a few men in my area that either sat down or stood the entire time with arms crossed with a "too cool for the New Kids" look instead of enjoying the moment with their significant other. Overall, a pretty cool show full with interaction from the New Kids, eye candy for the ladies, and tons of flashy lighting, pyrotechnics, and confetti to complete the evening. ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuu  3.5

VThe newest of all the LVAC locations, this one is the biggest, cleanest and has the most updated equipment.\u000a\u000aIt can get pretty crowded and parking can also be a hassle, so its best to avoid peak hours.\u000aIts not too bad if you work out early in the morning, or after 8pm when the crowds tend to die down.\u000a\u000aClasses here are also great, but arrive early, especially for Zumba classes, because they do get packed!...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(153/365) "Rock Your Body"

VGot there at  1:30am and there were only two other couples...Seems like the chef brought with him a few of the popular items they serve at EN, but the food and the quality of ingredients were outstanding. Recently,Raku had a little write up in this month's GQ Magazine by Alan Richman who is a big time food critic, so with Raku being one of his"Restaurants in the country to dine at" says ALOT..If you're not a fan of tofu, this place will make you love it! Homade tofu is presented in various ways on the menu, but we got the Agedashi  special with ikura and nameko mushrooms which ROCKED! other items we ordered were: Sashimi salad, Oden with meat guts(intestine) and soft fish cake, from the Robata grill,Kobe Beef Skewers, Kobe Beef Outside Skirt with Garlic, Potato with Corn(from EN), and Lamb Chop(perfect medium rare). Our waitress made a mistake, so the deep fried cutlet(tonkatsu) was on the house.I had to get my Foie Gras fix, so I got  the Foie Gras with Udon Noodle soup(I get two when we dine at EN) Desserts we got were the Fluffy Cheesecake(another one from EN),Brown Sugar Bubbly Pudding\u000awhich is actually either a baked or steamed custard topped off with cold frothy milk, and Meltin' Creamy Chocolate Cake, which is your standard liquid center/chocolate lava cake.Didn't check out the restroom, it was 3am and we had closed the restaurant down. We'll do that when we come back for more Kobe Beef, Uni, Tofu, Foie Gras, and all that other good stuff!

VLong overdue for an update, iits been well over a year since we've dined here.\u000aThis time, instead of sit down dining with a full menu, it was more like a cocktail reception\u000awith signature bites and bottomless sake and asahi for 4 hours straight!\u000a\u000aThe dining area has also expanded  with a couple of tables suited for bigger parties, as well as a couple of private dining rooms which is big enough to fit 4-6 people.\u000a\u000aAlso added to the expansion is another bathroom, so there's not one, but two cool bathrooms to check out! The first one has an artifiical grass entrance with an artificial tree and flowers with birds chirping, and the second bathroom has an underwater theme to it complete with a fish tank and high tech toilet with optioinal " cheek warmer" should it come in contact with the toilet seat.(See photos....)\u000a\u000aPlanning to return in the future to check out Chef Endo's Omakase tasting....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(89/365) "RAKUholic Relapse"

VWhoa!? This place has definitely cleaned up...it doesn't look run down anymore and the dirtiness and stench yelpers have mentioned are pretty much under control here.\u000a\u000aThe produce area is alot more clean and organized, I even spied some Taro Leaves for any future cravings of Lau Lau I may have, and the seafood and butcher section is still packed with people shopping for their daily/weekly dinner. Although it is not my choice for Asian markets,(I prefer 168 and Greenland) its good to know that Ranch 99 is another option.\u000a\u000aCheck it out if you're in the area...its not as bad as the outdated reviews mention.

VI eagerly awaited this evening as we were having dinner with great friends who also happened to be repeat diners here, and one of them were celebrating a birthday.\u000a\u000aI chose the six-course prix-fixe menu and believe me, it is A LOT of food! I'm not going into every little detail about the food, but just more notes regarding our overall experience. We started with an amuse bouche of Beet Veloute with Buratta. Clean, refreshing, great way to awaken the palate of the courses ahead.\u000a\u000aThe bread cart lived up to the hype where we first received an assortment as suggested by Yann, the person who is in charge of the bread, cheese and mignardise carts. The bread selections were warm, pillowy and tasty, but the star to me was the butter from Brittany,France. Seriously THE BEST butter I have tasted! My next course of the Foie Gras and Artichoke Salad was good, but more of a tease with three paper-thin slices that left me wanting more. My Hot Appetizer of the Soft Egg with Comte Sauce and Iberico Ham was the bomb bite of the evening that was also topped with a gang of shaved White Truffle....:9 So good, I didn't want this one to end.\u000a\u000a We had no more bread, we didn't want to fill up on bread, and I sure as hell wasn't gonna let that butter go to waste, so we asked Yann If we could just have the breads that weren't in our first assortment. He has a woman assisting in the dining room put together the bread assortment, and she comes back WITH THE SAME BREADS and they are more stone cold than Steve Austin!? She said that they only warm up the first round,(FYI) eating too much warm bread can lead to indigestion(or something along those lines) and that the chef rather we have space to enjoy other courses. After her lecture at our table, we repeated that we weren't trying to fill up on bread and just wanted to taste the two or three types that we didn't get. "Oh, we ran out of those" she replies. Um, newsflash, last time I checked, no Michelin 3-Star establishment  86s ANYTHING(86-kitchen lingo when you run out of something) Her demeanor definitely put a damper on the rest of our evening. We were one of the last tables of the evening, and when one of the ladies in our party passed the bread cart, those breads that she claimed they were out of were indeed there...\u000a\u000aHot Entrees came next. first the Sea Bass, then the Veal Chop. The Sea Bass was exceptional whereas the Veal Chop was okay. The Cheese course was another highlight where I chose a nice blue, a very ripe Camembert, Comte, Reblochon, and Pont l'eveque served with a raisin walnut bread. \u000a\u000aThe grand finale of desserts was next, where I enjoyed my Sugar Sphere with Yogurt and Blueberry Sorbet. We also had a cake brought out for the birthday boy which was a Vaccherin Glace with vanilla ice cream and raspberry sorbet which happened to be one of the better desserts on our table along with the creme brulee. Our table collectively must've had at least half of the offerings on the mignardise cart which were good, but not memorable....Sometimes, less is more.\u000a\u000aFrom reading other reviews, it seems like couples received better service, as opposed to bigger parties(there were six of us). Not even a baked item to take home as other reviews also stated...maybe they ran out of that too? I doubt my review will make any difference, and keep in mind...this is what our party experienced, so if this is still on your bucket list, go for it!\u000a\u000aGlad I can finally take this off the bucket list and for the most part, the evening was very much enjoyed with  good food, great company and the very professional, top notch service from Yann beginning to end...3.5 Stars    ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/   \u005cuuu/   \u005cuuu/   \u005cuu    3.5\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(12/365) "3 from Michelin, 3.5 From Me"

Not even my glass of Newcastle would convince me to go up and act a fool...\u000a\u000aAfter a while, Ife was the only brave soul to belt out a tune, and she did a mighty fine job! we all chatted it up the rest of the evening until the wee hours of the morning.\u000a\u000aLooking for a place to chill and throw back a few?

VWe stopped in to belt out some tunes after a great dinner with friends. It looks cool and inviting when you first step inside with works of art of Tupac, Biggie, and Snoop, with a little bar out front and k-pop on the TV screens.\u000a\u000aWhen you step in the rooms though, its bare bones and dark with not a lot of good English song selections and/or up to date hits. The remote seems to be on its last legs, and it kinda throws you off when you're trying to listen to someone sing a Michael Buble tune while following the lyrics but have Drake and Lil' Wayne with a Hoochie Mama on the screen!? Light up tambourines are available while you're singing with your group and a free bottle of (Arrowhead) water is given to you with your Yelp Check-In. \u000a\u000aThere are better spots around town, like the low-key XO Karaoke on Maryland where seating and song selection are much better, and you can bring food inside your room, as long as you buy drinks from her...Oh, she'll even pour some complimentary Soju too!

VChecked out Blue Fin a couple of weeks ago, and everything we ordered was awesome!\u000a\u000awe came in right at dinner time(3pm) no wait, greeted by Chef Jin and his wife, I was already luvin' the mom and pop vibe...\u000a\u000aWe started off with some nigiri-salmon, hamachi belly, super white tuna, unagi, snapper, ikura, and amaebi WITH the fried heads! Other places you have to request it.\u000a\u000aOne very noticeable detail is in the rice...Chef Jin seasons his rice like you're supposed to, and his cuts of fish on the nigiri are thick, not skimpy at all... that's a first in all of my AYCE experiences...\u000a\u000anext, we moved on to some of his side dishes, well more like first and second courses...his portions are VERY generous!  You could have made a complete meal out of his soft shell crab or Hamachi Kama! His baked mussels are presented in an escargot dish which has an upscale look,and we were also curious about  his"Japanese Stuffing" which is your Dynamite, but instead of a shell, he presents it in the form of a seafood bruschetta, and the olive oil and salt in the bread just give it another flavor dimension that makes sense.\u000a\u000aI was getting full but there was so much more I wanted to try...we ordered half rolls of the blue fin special, wet dream, the mexican and tokyo express....each and every bite was EXCELLENT!\u000a\u000aAs always(at least for me) there's always room for dessert, so we finished off with mango mochi ice cream, tempura ice cream(DOUBLE the size of Sushi Mon's), and green tea ice cream.\u000a\u000aGreat service, no wait, and very tasty food, which is also visually appealing. Chef Jin also wins on presentation points...We're in the process of moving, so pix will be posted laterSo looking forward to some Omega action with fellow Yelpers tomorrow@ Blue Fin's 2-Year Anniversary......ALOHA!!!

I forgot who else???\u000a\u000aThe night started with an Amuse Bouche of what the chefs call Adios Happy Hour- A mound of  seasoned sushi rice speckled with diced tuna atop a fried shiso(perilla or beefsteak)leaf, topped with a fried quail egg, garnished with kaiware(radish)sprouts, and drizzled with truffle oil........YUMMMMMMMY!!!!!!!!\u000a\u000aAn instant hit with everyone by seeing all the clean plates, we were ready for more omega action! various types of nigiri and rolls start arriving....again denied Uni, so I double up on the amaebi with the best shrimp chips EVER!(The fried heads with all that "head love")\u000a\u000aAs everyone is chowing down, I have my mind set on a couple of off the menu chefs specials that ARE NOT included in the AYCE price...\u000aSo I order the Truffled Sashimi and the Chirashi, and while I wait and chat with the other yelpers\u000a\u000a5 minutes later, my orders arrive-Truffled Sashimi with thick slices of  maguro, salmon, hamachi belly, super white tuna, and a couple of pieces of shrimp, all drizzled with truffle oil...JUST LIKE BUTTA!!!!!!!\u000a\u000aThe Chirashi is a bigger cousin of the amuse bouche, about 3-4 times bigger, but instead of the fried egg and shiso leaf, covered with more tuna, salmon, hamachi belly, shrimp and tamago, topped with red and green tobiko caviar, my wife's new favorite thing at Blue Fin.\u000a\u000aNot even close to tapping out yet, I try the johnny johnny, sweetheart ,and get a taste of other rolls and nigiri getting passed around my way...I wind down with more hamachi belly, super white tuna, and unagi, and finally end with strawberry, green tea, and mango mochi ice cream\u000a\u000aoverall, a great evening indeed....great service, awesome food and cool people.......Sushi Mon, you've got competition!.....ALOHA!!!

VLowering my rating to 1 star solely because of the service we got from Jin's IGNORANT wife.\u000a\u000aMy wife and I were the ONLY ONES there for lunch\u000a\u000aWe did AYCE as usual, did some nigiri, tried specials, tried different rolls, and we enjoyed the Chirashi(off the menu) so much, from attending Lisa L's UYE, we asked if we could order it...Jin wasn't there, but the other chef, Ynot was. we showed him the picture told him about the Yelp event,etc. so he checked with Jin's wife if it was possible.\u000a\u000aThis is what she said:\u000a\u000a"Oh, this takes longer to prepare and this is for VIP people only."\u000aI couldn't help but mumble to my wife, "F--K ME, I guess we're not considered VIP".\u000a\u000aWe were willing to pay\u000awe were willing to wait\u000aWE WERE THE ONLY ONES THERE\u000a\u000aChef Ynot sensed that we were pissed and disgusted, our orders stopped, and we just couldn't believe she had the nerve to say what she said...SERVICE IS PART OF THE DINING EXPERIENCE!\u000a\u000aimmediately chef Ynot made a roll on the fly and named it the Sylvia \u000aRoll. Thanks, but too little too late. As a business owner, every customer should be treated as a "VIP"\u000a\u000aWe finished the roll, thanked Chef Ynot and walked right out the door.\u000aThats the last time we'll ever go there....Thank goodness for Wayne's, Sushi Mon, and Sin City, Places where we're ALWAYS treated like VIPS....ALOHA!!!

VCame here for Warren P.'s All-Star Lechon UYE and feast on some "Hawaiian inspired" grindz.....The lechon itself was okay...\u000a\u000aOne of the cooks sliced me of a big honkin' piece of crispy skin, and I saw that no one was touching the pig's feet, so I asked for the ENTIRE front leg/foot :) the top half was very meaty and tasted more like Chinese-style roast pork, but from the kneecap down, it was totally inedible, just bone and tough skin. The ahi and tako poke were good, as was the lomi salmon and the 3 bowls of poi I had.\u000a\u000aDessert was kinda sad...no haupia, and slim pickin' on the rest of the sweets. The company was better than the food.Guess I'll stick to Island Flavor next time I'm in the mood for some Hawaiian grindz....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(12/365) "Here, piggy piggy!!!"

VWoo Che is one of the many choices you have in town when it comes to all-you-can-eat gluttony.\u000a\u000aThey have a pretty killer spread here of Items you can choose to bring back and grill at your table, but if you're the type that just likes to scarf down food and not have to wait for it to cook, then they have a variety of cooked items here as well.\u000a\u000aAs other reviews mention, service here can be spotty at times, and do not come in here all dressed up for a night on the town because the food smells will permeate your clothes (and hair) its not even funny...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(311/365) "Smell-o-vision....See, taste, and SMELL!!!"

VThis is one of the many reviews that got away ....until now, heh heh... \u000aI like the vibe and atmosphere of FTR and its cool to go with a bunch of people. They also have a great selection of drinks and some even come in souvenir cups made by local artists\u000a\u000aBUT...\u000a\u000aI agree with Mario S. on the uncomfortable wooden seats FTR has, and if you're claustrophobic, this place can get pretty packed. Secondhand smoke is pretty bad here on top of their tiny parking lot outside.\u000aFood isn't served here, so you also have to think of food options afterwards, like Herbs & Rye's Reverse Happy Hour which is what we did...ALOHA!!!

VIf it wasn't for Yelp, I would've never known this place exsisted...Well, better late then never, right?\u000a\u000aMahalo Andy T. for hosting a UYE at Wayne's. What a great time it was!\u000aMy wife and I got there a liitle earlier than the meet up time which was 6:30. We peek in and see that Wayne and his wife Heidi are still setting up for dinner(and all us Yelpers took the whole back of the dining room)\u000a\u000a"Welcome to Wayne's" says Wayne. I mention that we're with the Yelp party, and he notices that I'm sporting a Sasabune shirt( one of the top sushi spots on Oahu) so from perfect english, the pidgin starts flowing and we "talk story"\u000a\u000aWayne: "What Brah? you from da islands too?\u000a\u000aMe: "Yup, Pearl City"\u000a\u000aWayne: "Ho, I live on da odda side of da mountains...Kahalu'u"\u000a\u000aMe: "Right on brah..."\u000a\u000aThen the usual "How long you been in Vegas, where you work, what you do, etc. He also proceeds to show me the HUGE lobster he caught and Sole(pronounced Soh-leh) the Samoan crab that he used \u000ato keep in his salt water tank....Then he busts out a photo of the Biggest Blue pincher Crab I've ever seen, just as big as the girl in the photo! He says" Das' from Molokai....I would've kept someting li' dat in my tank."  At this point I feel as if I were talking to an uncle. a couple of minutes later, Andy and Lily show up and the rest of the yelpers slowly trickle in.\u000a\u000aAs a group we all decided on the Chef's "Omakase" and decided to let Wayne take our tastebuds on a ride...\u000a\u000a1) "Da Buggah Ono"-(English: This is quite tasty)\u000aDeep fried roll with no rice\u000a\u000a2)Miso Butterfish(AKA Black Cod)-Could've had TWO plates of this....JUST LIKE BUTTA!\u000a\u000a3)Hamachi Jalapeno- melted in your mouth with a nice heat\u000a\u000a4)Wayne Bo roll- Wayne's rainbow roll\u000a\u000a5)Shiso Horny, She love you long time- The shiso gave this roll an interesting flavor combination\u000a\u000a6)"What Brah, Beef???"-(English: "Excuse me, wanna fight?)\u000aBeef tenderloin and Wayne's Ginger sauce....YUM!\u000a\u000a7)Death Roll (As requested by Andy) SPICY ASS HABANERO TUNA ROLL!!!-  I could only eat 2 pieces, a few of the yelpers were in pain and downing packets of sugar, fanning themselves, and all the leftovers went to Judd, Matt, and Tony. Wayne is not responsible for those who wish to partake in this roll, and his menu states under the Death Roll (Kissu Your Assu Sayonara!!!)\u000a\u000a8)Cajun Ahi Salad-Tony requested this last one, a favorite among regulars....very tasty and the creamy dressing helped cool everyones tastebuds\u000a\u000aThroughout the evening, we were treated to some karaoke action by Wayne and Heidi, and DO THEY HAVE PIPES!?!?!?!?!?\u000aWayne sang renditions of "You are Everything" and "Too Much Heaven"\u000aand Heidi sang renditions of "Don't Know Why" and "Black Velvet"\u000a\u000aWayne and Heidi were even nice enough to give us the 411 on their love story and how they met (AWWWW!)\u000a\u000aOverall, a very memorable UYE (We practically closed the place down)\u000aand for being a person who usually just frequents AYCE sushi Joints, this is one spot I don't mind coming back to.\u000a\u000aUpon leaving, Wayne tells me, "What you doing Saturday???? It's my birthday....We gonna have Hawaiian Food...Come by" Didn't have to tell me twice....Of course I attended Wayne's 50th Birthday Bash, but that'll be in another review....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000a\u000a**FYI**-Wayne's current location will be in operation for about 3 more months(he'll be shutting down lunch service as well)\u000a\u000aHe is currently looking for a future spot to open, maybe around Oakey and Western

VSo Saturday rolls around and I attend Wayne's 50th Birthday Bash. it was mix of friends and family who attended, and what a great time it was.(On the other side of the Sushi Bar)\u000a\u000aCouple nights ago we feasted on sushi, now this time, I got to come back and feast on Wayne's local grindz....Yes, the birthday boy catered his own party too.\u000a\u000aThe guests viewed a family video of Wayne and his family and friends, then we got to feast on Wayne's local style buffet consisting of  Kalua Pig and Cabbage, Teriyaki Chicken, Kalbi, Spicy Ahi Poke, and Raw Crab Poke. It was so Onolicious, I had 2 rounds of all that goodness!\u000a\u000aSake started flowing, and Karaoke tunes were being sung...\u000aWhile all that was going on, Wayne's son Jesse was running the Sushi bar. I was totally tempted for some sushi as well, but I'll wait\u000auntil we return to Wayne's...didn't stay too much longer,because I had to work early the next day...\u000a\u000aProps to Wayne and Heidi for another stellar evening...ALOHA!!!

The ladies looked busy, but still greeted us and at the same time, a whole group of kids came in for a bite after soccer practice. Next thing you know, the soccer coach is taking our order!?!?\u000a\u000aHe happens to be the husband/owner with his wife(and also works the evening shift at Fat Boy) who is busy busting out the kids orders, and her other worker is also family, and its also her birthday, so everyone starts singing Happy Birthday which truly brightens her day. I just love businesses that display a strong sense of family/community on top of serving up good, honest food.\u000a\u000aI went with the owners suggestion of their popular Pastrami Boyger, and Wifey went with a Bacon Cheese Boyger, and we shared an order of fat Chencho  Fries. \u000aThe fries were good, but not something I'd order again. The burgers alone are what I'd return for. They don't have crazy toppings and add-ons like the trendier burger joints, their burger meat is well seasoned and fresh, never frozen, and burger buns are delivered fresh daily. The price points for their items are crazy cheap too!\u000aWent back the following weekend and tried their Guacamole Boyger and that was just as good!\u000a\u000aOther reviews cap on their location but hey, they seem to be doing fine right where they're at, and being in business for five years, they must be doing something right!? I base my restaurant reviews on two things: FOOD and SERVICE atmosphere and location aren't an issue for me. It shouldn't be for you either, if you're looking for solid burgers and great service. Their Pizza and Wings looked good too, so we'll definitely be back. Check them out if you haven't yet.  ALOHA!!!

VTwo words....KANAK ATTACK! Thats what happens when you put away one of Island Flavors' MASSIVE plate lunches!\u000a\u000adrove by Friday for their Lau Lau Plate hoping they didn't run out, and I was just in the nick of time because when I was done with my order, there were only 3 orders left\u000a\u000athe Lau Lau itself almost covered the whole plate! No complaints though, that's my kinda portion:)\u000a\u000aThe Poke and Lomi were also good but the Haupia was a little bit on the solid rubbery side(ease up on the cornstarch!)\u000a\u000aI'll definitely be back to try more of their grinds....ALOHA!!!

VWe came, we ate, we conquered.......well, we tried! A mix of familiar faces and a couple of first-time UYE'ers and even one that was in town for business from Cali...The food as always was very delicious, and aside from a hiccup with someones order, service overall was good.\u000a\u000aalmost everyone had doggie bags due to their massive portions, but a few of us had to have dessert...I had a couple bites of the kona coffee mud pie and made the mistake of turning my back and it "mysteriously"\u000adisappeared...The bread pudding was comfort food at its finest, and so was the haupia cake.\u000a\u000aMahalo to all of those in attendance and also to the gang at Island Flavor\u000afor a great evening...ALOHA!!!

VWe haven't been back ever since my "Kanak Attack" UYE, so we decided to pay another visit for some onolicious grindz.\u000a"Wow! the counter space is gone, place looks more open" I told wifey...Aunty behind the register says "Yeah, Small Kine, Small Kine"...meaning yes, we made a few changes and the place looks a little different. Just love it when I hear local transplants talking pidgin to da max(NOT the bird!) and KCCN is playing on the stereo. Makes me feel I've never left home.\u000a\u000aperusing the specials, I come across something that is only found on Maui(up until now) Guri Guri(pronounced goodie goodie) which is basically sherbet. I asked Aunty if its made, or if they got it from Maui, and she says "Nice try bruddah, I not gonna tell you!" LOL!!!!..they offer Strawberry and Blue Vanilla and for $4 it comes in a half-pound size poke container...That's dessert, but back to the food....\u000a\u000aWe got The Fried Rice Omelette and Furikake Shrimp and they were Onolicious as usual. Can't go wrong with any of the food here, just come with an appetite because one entree could seriously feed two people.\u000a\u000aStill wanting dessert, we were gonna get the Haupia Cake but it wasn't on the menu.\u000awhat they did have was a Haupia Ice Cream Pie, so we tried that and also got a Strawberry Guri Guri. The Pie was okay, but not as good as a cake and the Guri Guri was good, but slightly harder from being prepacked. Service here is always great, everyone checks up on you and always making you feel welcome...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(5/100) "Get Your Guri Guri Here!"

V*********************************Review # 800**********************************************\u000a\u000aPoke(po-keh, NOT po-key) is another one of those local Hawaiian specialties that is near and dear to my heart. Back in high school while other friends were working retail or flipping burgers at fast food joints, I got a job with another friend at a local fishmarket.\u000a\u000aOf course, it had its pros and cons-I knew nothing about cooking at the time, and we did just the grunt work of preparing the taro leaves and de-boning and cutting up pork butts to prepare for the ladies in the morning who would prepare Kalua Pig and Lau Lau, and clean bunches of green bananas so the boss could make his kick-ass Pasteles. Yeah, we would itch like hell from the taro leaves and reek  of the fishmarket when we got home, but at that time, it was all about having money to go out and kick it with friends and live it up like the teenagers we were.\u000a\u000aDuring my time here, the boss even had enough trust in me to teach me how to make his different kinds of poke preparations and before you know it, I didn't have to do all that grunt work anymore. I ran the cash register and took care of preparing the different types of poke. The best compliment I got was when a little lady who's a regular came to get her usual fix of Ahi Limu Poke, then she asked for the boss... Crap! I thought I was gonna be in trouble for screwing her order up! The boss wasn't around and he was at his other location in town, so after I told her, she replied "Oh, this tastes exactly like how he makes his poke" That made my day, and I was sweating bullets for nothing!\u000a\u000aPoke Express is one place that stirs up all those memories every time we stop in to feed our poke addiction. Owners Alison and Darren have brought the tastes of home to the 9th Island, and have created a huge fan base of local transplants and poke lovers as well!\u000a\u000aThere is also a variety local goodies and home accents on the back shelves, shirts, stickers, and hats up front and even a freezer section of local specialities you can purchase. Inside is very clean, and Iove that I feel like I'm home, especially hearing all the talking in pidgin from other local customers and even the owners themselves.\u000a\u000aIngredients are fresh as can be here and there are endless combinations of poke that they make on the spot. Undecided what to get? Ask for a sample! Our favorites right now are the Spicy Ahi, Ahi Limu, Ahi Shoyu, and Limu Tako Poke. Haven't seen Raw Crab, but if and when they do have it, I may just get some of that as well. The location is perfect, as it is on our side of town, and also a couple of doors down from another tasty local joint (808 Mixed Plate) The perfect accompaniment to poke? Go next door to the liquor store and get an ICE COLD BEER!  I bet you thought I was gonna say rice!?!?! SUCKA!!!! .......... :p      ALOHA!!!

VOne of our few "chain" establishments we go to once in a while...\u000a\u000awe always love their paradise passion iced tea and they have a pretty addicting bread basket.....Lately they've added small plates/tapas to their already huge and sometimes confusing menu, and their beet salad was pretty good.\u000a\u000aOne thing you'd never think would end up on a Cheesecake Factory Menu would be asian steamed bun sandwiches which they have renamed "Vietnamese Tacos" and Indian fry bread which they call "The Navajo"\u000aWe ordered both items since we wanted to try their newer items and stay away from the usual burger or salad.\u000a\u000aBoth these items were quite tasty and the steamed bun"tacos" are exactly the kind that Bachi Burger serves up, but the difference is that you get 3 steamed buns at half the price of what Bachi Burger charges, and they serve 2 per order\u000a\u000aThe indian fry bread was bomb too. My wife made a good choice and she enjoyed it as well. After chowing down on their Chicken Bellagio special and\u000asharing a banana cheesecake for dessert, we were happy campers....ALOHA!!!

VCame back for dinner because we're big fans of the small plate menu, which allows us to try lots of different things.\u000a\u000aOn this visit, we grubbed on our usual Vietnamese Tacos(AKA Bao), Samosas, Beet Salad, Pear and Blue Cheese Flatbread, and tried a new item, Roasted Shishito Peppers, which was a VERY generous serving. How generous? 45 peppers! (Ichiza gives you even less per order) As always, everything was great and very filling. \u000a\u000aStop in and try their small plates, you don't know what you're missing out on!....ALOHA!!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(82/365) "Tapas at the Factory"

VGot into the line at 6:45ish, finally sat down at about 9pm. This place was PACKED. Like other new places, it takes some time to work out the kinks, so I went to each station to see what selections Studio B had to offer.I didn't run into any problems like the first reviewer had, but I did notice no signs over any of the food items. Lucky for me, I'm in the food business, so I knew the majority of selections that were put out. What do you do when you don't know what something is? ASK! DUH!? thats what the person in that food station is there for. Maybe that was the purpose of no signage? Maybe they want it to be more interactive? Who knows? IT DOESN"T HURT TO ASK. There was your usual carving stations featuring whole roasted fish, turkey, prime rib and salmon,etc, Italian section with pizza, pasta and salads, Asian side with stir-fry, noodles,etc. and of couse, your crab legs on the weekend. The Pad Thai and Paella were decent,considering you dont usually find these at a buffet, the prime rib was a litlle over done for my liking, but the raw seafood section was pretty good, so the rest of my dinner was sashimi, salmon and hamachi nigiri, and oysters on the half shell. Another cool thing is that they have a bar where you can get all-you-can-drink wines by the glass, beers and root beer on tap, and it comes with your meal, which I've never seen in a buffet(They also have complimentary soft drink stands scattered throughout the casino floor, how cool is that?) Now for dessert...I have to say that it is the best dessert selection I've seen in a buffet, thanks to the man in charge, Pastry Chef Jean-Claude Canestrier MOF, World Pastry Champion(Formerly from Paris Hotel) Crepes made to order, hot out-of-the-oven chocolate chip cookies and liquid center chocolate cakes, flan, panna cotta, raspberry macaroon, white chocolate cheesecake, lemon meringue tarts, cannoli, eclairs,mango-coconut cake, and a selection of gelatos and sorbettos, this place was pretty good. Walked by Baby Cakes(Their Patisserie) and All of the desserts in the showcase were GONE....Oh well, there's always next time!

VI've always been wanting to stop in to try one of their Coney Dogs and finally got the chance. Patti was very nice and helped make my choices fairly easy "We are known for our Coney Dogs" she says...I've never heard of a Loose Burger either, so I was curious about that-its just like a burger, but not in patty form, but in cooked ground beef form.\u000a\u000a I decided on a combo dog and burger which is topped with chili, more beef, cheese, and onions and I got a peach Faygo which tasted great. The only other place I've ever seen these sodas are at The Lunch Box, but DMC carries more flavors. \u000a\u000aCool little joint if you're in the area to grab a quick bite...ALOHA!!!

VYour Typical Station Casino Buffet set up....nice decor, but slim pickings on the food items...same food items were placed at the BBQ and carving stations, salad bar was pretty mediocre, and a lot of food items had that "sitting on the buffet line too long and needed to be changed out" look. \u000a\u000aOf all the Station Casinos, the ones at Green Valley Ranch and Red Rock are your better bets. don't waste your time with the others...ALOHA!!!

VThe only thing authentic about this restaurant and its sister properties are the fresh tortillas being made by little abuelita(grandma) as you enter...\u000a\u000a"gringofied" is the type of so-called Mexican food they serve here. Not Gourmet, not Traditional, and definitely not Authentic...Las Vegas has an abundance of mexican restaurants that serve up more soulful, traditional, and FLAVORFUL food......\u000a\u000aFideo was not anything but bland tomato water with little skinny noodles...pretty blah\u000a\u000aIf you consider yourselves authentic, then Horchatta would be made from scratch, not from the ready made stuff you serve out of the machines....NASTY!\u000a\u000aeverything we ordered had no salt or spice....chille rellenos were bland, beef tacos lacked major salt and flavoring.......\u000a\u000afor all of Lindos items containing chicken, chunk chicken FROM THE CAN is used, WHAT"S UP WITH THAT?????\u000a\u000aI'm all about good food done right, but the awful karaoke-like cover band songs blairing out of the speakers told you even more that this isn't authentic at all......La Bamba??? Guantanamera???WTH?????\u000a\u000awe didn't finish our food(and I can put away some major food) and of course didn't need a box to take our leftovers....what a fourth of July it was....definitely fireworks outside, but definitely not in the food....Hey Las Vegans, do yourselves a favor and go to Chevy's if you want more flavorful, decent "americanized" comida.\u000a\u000aGoing back to the awful karaokefied music, a Mariachi band would have been better instead of that awful sounding man with his keyboard you hired for the 4th of July....\u000a\u000aVamos a volver???(Will we return???)\u000a\u000aNUNCA!!!!(NEVER!!!!).....ALOHA!!!!

VI vowed to never return here, but ever since they removed the "Lindo", the quality of the food seems to have gotten much better.\u000a\u000aSunday Brunch is a good example. Went to Jade's UYE and met up with some of the gang, and for $13.95 all you can eat AND drink? Not too shabby! Fresh Tortillas to enjoy with the great spread- Huevos Mexicanas, Rice, Beans, Fajitas, Bacon, Menudo, Gallo Al Cognac, Shrimp Ceviche, Chips, Salsa, and Guacamole, Fruit Salad and Pan Dulce....Something for everyone! The AYCD selections were pretty good too-Horchata(not homemade), Mimosas, Margaritas...totally a great deal, and something that everyone should try at least once.\u000a\u000aGood times with the gang yet again....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(37/100) "Mimosas, Menudo, and Margaritas, Oh My!"

VI always hit up the cookbook section any time we're here to see what I can add to my library of cookbooks\u000a. This time, I hit the motherlode and got a complete series from 1968 which featured the following volumes:\u000a\u000aAmerican Cooking:The Eastern Heartland\u000aAmerican Cooking:Creole and Acadian\u000aAmerican Cooking:The Northwest\u000aAmerican Cooking:New England\u000aWines and Spirits\u000aThe Cooking of Italy\u000aThe Cooking of China\u000aThe Cooking of Provincial France\u000aA Quintet of Cuisines\u000a\u000aI was particularly interested in the American cooking volumes because I love reading and researching about American Regional Cuisines and from time to time, I also like to execute some recipes and give an updated twist to it. On the other hand, I couldn't just get a few from the set, so I bought 'em all!\u000aI also grabbed an herb cookbook and didn't pay much either...Each book was only $1.99 but there was a "Buy 4 books, get 1 free" deal, so I really lucked out!\u000aYou never know what you'll find here at Savers!....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(74/100) "Poppin' Books, Not Tags..."

VOne of my favorite asian stores in town aside from Greenland and SF...\u000a\u000aTried a couple of breads and pastries from Desir Bakery as well, and they were reasonably priced. They have a pretty wide variety of fruits and vegetables, and even the more exotic stuff(Thai Basil, Golden Kiwi, Durian) you don't see in Smith's, Albertson's, Fresh and Easy,etc...\u000a\u000aI usually shop here for asian condiments, on occasion, meats,asian fruits and veggies, and most often their fish and Dungeoness Crab....I like the fact that most Asian markets in town will also clean and cook your fish up for you at no additional charge.\u000a\u000aI do avoid the food/deli area though....to me, the food just never looks appetizing there, more like a health hazard to be avoided with that area being open and attracting flies......yikes!\u000a\u000aTheir candy/snack section is pretty cool too, and its almost time for the lady who runs the Roasted Chestnut Stand outside....can't wait....ALOHA!!!!

VStopped by to grab some ingredients for dinner with the wifey. I love the fresh  produce and aromatics available here-fresh, great quality, and very cheap!\u000a\u000aI wanted to make something quick and easy for our "cooking classes" for the next couple days together....I picked up some mussels, veggies and aromatics. I've also become addicted to the Sweet Roti at Big Wong's, so I picked some of those up(Its called Puff Paratha in the freezer section) with some Avocado ice cream and tropical fruits for dessert...\u000a\u000aSo for our first night, we whipped up some Mussels in Thai Style Coconut Broth over Rice Noodles and Sweet Roti with Tropical Fruits and Avocado Ice Cream.\u000aThe next evening, we cooked up some Veggie Panang Curry which was absolutely Tasty! I love being able to get everything in one place, enjoying restaurant quality food at home, and most of all not paying an arm and a leg for it!\u000a\u000aA crab feed may be in the near future...Dungeness Crab for $3.99 a pound? Sure!...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(123/365) "Home Cookin"

VAt any family gathering, food is usually involved, and I usually contribute a couple of things....this year however, I was in the driver's seat and responsible for most of the food. On top of that, time and energy was definitely not on my side. Only having New Years Eve off, and family in town, I knew I was already spending half the day getting the ingredients and cooking for our NYE dinner...I was thinking variety, quick and simple to put together, and more importantly, YUMMY!. Thank goodness Wifey went out and got things the day before to add to our dinner-Cheeses and Arancini from Trader Joe's, and Pupusas from Rincon Catratcho.\u000a\u000a168 is one of my three "go to" markets...the other two being Greenland and Cardenas because they're all relatively close to each other, have great items, and are on my way home. So my brother-in-law is a huge fan of duck, so immediately I thought Crispy Duck Bao! So I hustle to the deli side only to see an EMPTY warmer\u000awhere the ducks are usually hanging and a long line of people. In a state of panic, I asked "Are you sold out of Ducks?"..."11 O' Clock" he says...(it was 10:30am) Whew! we got time....so like Supermarket Sweep, I'm gathering all my stuff and planning the menu "on the fly" in my head- steamed buns, mushrooms, cilantro. scallions, chiles, ginger, hoisin, unagi(for sushi)  mussels to bake like all the sushi joints do. The plan was to make fried rice omelettes for breakfast, so I got some kamaboko, lup cheong, and char siu which are must haves in my fried rice.\u000aThai style spinach wraps are quick and easy, so I picked up ingredients for that as well, but the spinach leaves were tiny, so I got my duck and a slab of char siu, payed for the items, and off to Greenland we were.....ALOHA!!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(141/365) "Supermarket Sweep"

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(153/365) "The 411 on 168"\u000a\u000aStill one of my favorite Asian markets to shop at, I love that I am able to get everything I\u000aneed in one store. Many a home cooked meals came from ingredients here, and this time, Chicken Panang Curry was on the menu at Chez Nelson's. The produce selection is always plentiful, fresh, and cheap here, and their deli section has cleaned up and serves up very tasty Items too.\u000a\u000aThe bakery section also serves up some killer sweets(love their Taro Cake and Portuguese Egg Tarts! ;9) breads, and other savory snacks as well. I grabbed a bottle of Singha to go with dinner(love STILL getting carded for alcohol!) and I was on my way.\u000aStop in if you're ever in the area, and keep an eye out for when the price per pound for Live Dungeness Crab drops to under $5.99 for a killer crab feast!

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(155/365) "Hand Job"\u000a\u000aI am no expert on Ethiopian Cuisine,but when the chance arrived to meet up with The D's(David and Debbie) who have dined here on more than one occasion, I decided to give it another go. David's sister and her husband also joined us, so with our party of 5, the best thing to do with their 13 item menu was go with the meat sampler and the vegetarian sampler so we could try a variety of things. We also got one of their Tibs offerings as well.\u000a\u000aWe also tried an Ethiopian beer which was pretty good ,and I guess Ethiopians take their coffee seriously as we were sat next to the area where the coffee ceremony takes place which would have been interesting to see, but we were the only diners and we came for the food, not the coffee. I love the opportunity to be able to eat with  your hands and this is one of the few places in town where your hands are the silverware. \u000a\u000aOur meal arrives on a huge silver platter and our waiter also disperses the Tibs in small piles onto the platter so that it is accessible to everyone. The smell of the Injera reminded me right away of San Francisco Sourdough and it also does have a slight tang to it due to the fermentation process the Injera batter goes through before being steamed. I loved the flavors of each item I sampled,(Lentils, Collard Greens, Green Beans, Lamb, a Beef Jerky type item, a smoked meat one, etc.) but my favorites were the Lamb, Tibs, and Spicy Lentils. The salad was nothing special with Italian dressing on top, and the cheese looked like Feta, but tasted more like a Queso Fresco. The prices here are very cheap too.  Came out to $10/person, tip included.  Can't wait to come back!  ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  4

VStopped in before the St. Patty's Day Parade started and I ask the lady "what must I try since its my first time here?"\u000a\u000a"Definitely the danish and since it St. Patty's Day, the Whiskey cake" So I ordered a Cheese Danish, Bear Claw, and a Whiskey Cake. Waiting for my order, I snap some photos to go along with my review which is cool since there wasn't anyone in line.\u000a\u000aThe same lady getting my order hands me a key lime tart-"here you go, the chef just made these, so you can be our taste tester"-SWEET!!!\u000a\u000aThe Key Lime Tart was very tart and tangy, and not overly sweet, and the Whiskey Cake was good with just the right amount of booziness.\u000a\u000aMy absolute favorites here are Chef Flemming's Danish selections. You can taste and see the passion, soul, and dedication in each danish. \u000a\u000aHis laminated doughs** are absolute perfection!-SEE BEAR CLAW PIC!\u000a(The lamination process consists of a prepared dough and butter which is "locked in" and goes through a series of folds and turns creating fine layers of dough and butter. When baked, the butter melts, separates the layers of dough, and creates steam causing the dough to rise and create light, flaky pastry layers. Examples are Puff pastry, Croissants, and of course, Danish.)\u000aYou should be able to taste and feel the crunchiness and flakiness of a properly made danish. If it tastes and/or feels "cakey" or 'bready", it ain't a good danish...for the price he charges, its a steal and definitely is just as good as the spots on the strip. Can't wait to return and try the rest of his danish assortment....ALOHA!!!

VOkay, this is two updates in one..We were in the area so I kinda twisted my wifey's arm cause I was jonezing for a Bear Claw and a Cheese Danish....it was already 3pm, so I know my chances were slim, as they've been known to run out early in the day.\u000aso as I enter, I immediately scan the area where the danish are and they're out of Bear Claws:(, but wait, there is one Last Cheese Danish that has my name on it! Along with that, I also get a Cherry, Apricot, and Blueberry Danish, and boy were they all YUMMY!\u000a\u000aOn my most recent visit, It was earlier in the day, about 11:30am, and they had already sold out of Cheese Danishes-NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!\u000aThey did however, have Bear Claws, so I got one of those, Blueberry Danish, and an apricot Danish...I had never had a Whoopie Pie either,\u000aso as I'm eyeing that(and holding up the line) lady asks," see something else you like?"\u000a\u000a"Never had a Whoopie Pie before...Chocolate or Banana?"  Lady replies "there are nice chunks of banana inside our Banana Whoopie Pie"  so Banana it is....Can't wait to come back for another Banana Whoopie Pie, and I'll come way earlier before they run out of Cheese Danishes...ALOHA!!!

VFRESH PASTA?????? CAN'T BEAT IT!!!!\u000a\u000aStopped in after a movie and we were in the area looking for some pasta action. the trusty Yelp App directed us here and it was good to see that fellow Yelpers rate this place pretty solid.\u000a\u000aAtmosphere was cozy and inviting, and from what I saw, you could purchase items and ingrediednts to cook up at home. Didn't have time to check out the deli case up front because it was an hour before closing, so we had to get our grub on...\u000aWe started of with the Escargot appetizer, and I liked the way it was presented on crostini so it could soak up all that buttery, garlicky goodness and definitely keep those Twilight vampires away.\u000a\u000aThere was this solo diner who seemed to be a regular moaning and groaning, mumbling to himself after each bite....I was thinking "Gee, this place is that good, thank goodness he didn't do a "When Harry Met Sally" moment(Meg Ryan, Coffee Shop, Remember????) I did a quick looksee what the hubbub was all about, and he was enjoying the Veal Special which came with potatoes, but I wanted me some pasta! (Menu Items change DAILY...) We decide to split the Chicken Parmigana since that came with pasta. So our waiter Tracy brings out two bowls of pasta and the plate containing the HUGE piece of chicken(They don't skimp on portions here either!) then, a waitress comes out with our other half of the order! WOW! two big breasteses!?!?!  Each bite was juicy and perfectly done, and so was the pasta.\u000a\u000aTracy always made sure we were taken care of, and towards the end of our meal, we ordered a Cannoli and a couple of Cappucinos to cap it off...as we're waiting, we're talking story with Tracy, and he asks, "Are you guys from Hawaii?" So I nod my head, he nods his, and at the same time, we both say "Pearl City"...SWEET, another homeboy!...Our Cannoli arrives, and Tracy also added a piece of Kahlua Pound Cake and berries.....its cool to have that "Hawaiian hook-up"...If that wasn't generous enough, He hands us a loaf of Ciabatta to take home..Mahalo Tracy!!!\u000a\u000aGreat food, awesome service, and we will most definitely be back......maybe for that Veal Special????....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(119/365) " Fresh Pasta Made Here"

VBack again for Pizza night(Wednesdays) Chef Marc fires up the oven in front of his restaurant outside and makes pizzas for patrons until about 9pm, or until he runs out.\u000a\u000aThis really is a hot spot for locals who want some kick-ass Italian food without the strip prices, let alone having to drive to the strip. We went to take a peek at the pizza action. Chef Marc was pumpin' out pizzas with one of his chefs and at the same time, bumpin' some Bob Marley on the sound system, just having a blast. "This is my fun night" he said. He was also excited and anxious about next Thursday's UYE, he was full of excitement and can't wait to share his "treat"...\u000a\u000aWe enter the restaurant and the dining room is PACKED!  There is one spot in the center lounge area, so we decided to dine there, which was actually comfy and perfect.\u000a\u000aOriginally, we were just coming in for pizza and beer, BUT I saw a grilled octopus appetizer on tonights menu, as well as his Ricci De Mare(Sea Urchin Linguini) so naturally, we ordered those items as well.\u000a\u000aThe octopus itself was really tender and delicious, unfortunately it was just a few pieces accompanied by a salad of apples, carrots, and celery. Chef Marc's pizzas are 11 inches, and range from $12-$15, and he adheres strictly to thhe VPN standards(like Settebello). We went simple and got the Margherita, and it was very delicious and definitely ranks up there with Settebello and Due Forni.  \u000a\u000aNow his Uni Linguini...nothing more to say other than FANTABULOUS!!!!!!! Fresh linguini with garlic, chili flakes, evoo, parsley and lemon combined with nice pieces of uni...absolute perfection! It actually brought out the sweetness of the uni, and even wifey was lovin' every bite. Now I'm gonna have to go to Greenland to get some so I can duplicate it at home:) If you plan on dining here on Wednesday nights, arrive early. We left just before 8pm and they were down to 5 pizzas left. \u000a\u000a**RECOMMENDATIONS**\u000a\u000aAny of Chef Marc's pasta dishes or entrees\u000a\u000aPizzas(Wednesday nights)\u000a\u000a\u000aALSO:\u000a\u000aUYE-"Steppin' Out": MANGIA! with Chef Marc\u000a\u000aThursday, February 2, 7:30pm\u000a\u000aSpecial Chef's Choice 5-course Tasting Menu, $50\u000a\u000a***10 SPOTS LEFT!!!***\u000a\u000aALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(156/365) " Pizza Night at Parma"

VWhat a great way to cap off our fun filled weekend! Friday's VIP treatment @ Lily and The Bank on June 1st(Our Anniversary), and the next day,  A Chef's Tasting @ Parma\u000aCreated by Chef Marc!\u000a\u000aChef Marc had other commitments that evening, but the kitchen crew and servers Ciro, Tracy, and Amber made it all happen as they always do! We enjoyed the following for our Anniversary Dinner:\u000a\u000aFIRST COURSE:FRESH BUFFALO MOZZARELLA CAPRESE SALAD\u000a\u000aFresh creamy mozzarella, market fresh Heirloom Tomatoes with basil and balsamic vinegar...excellent start. The Garlic Ciabatta with the nutty olive oil and balsamic was also ADDICTING, Ciro had to remind us there were 4 more courses to go!\u000a\u000aPAN SEARED SCALLOP, SQUID INK RISOTTO, AND UNI HOLLANDAISE\u000a\u000aGreat to see this one again! Easily the favorite dish of MANGIA!!! Round 2. a plump, sweet U-10 sea scallop from Boston paired with squid ink and uni???Total perfection, nuff' said!!!\u000a\u000aJIDORI CHICKEN WITH FINGERLING POTATOES ON TOTSOI GREENS\u000a\u000aOrganic Jidori chicken paired with roasted fingerling potatoes on totsoi greens from the farmer's market, perfectly executed and no complaints here!\u000a\u000a BISHOP'S HATS WITH A MASCARPONE TRUFFLE CREAM SAUCE\u000a\u000aCiro asked Amber to get us more bread( I thought he said to chill on the bread?)\u000a"Believe me, you're gonna need it for this one" ...The wild mushroom filled pasta was perfectly al dente, as with all of Chef Marc's pasta dishes, and the sauce was awesome, and thats where the bread came in...we wiped  our plates clean! "See, I told you huh?" Ciro says as he clears our table for our next course...by this time,\u000awifey is close to tapping out, and our entrees arrive.\u000a\u000aSEARED PEPPER AHI WITH RED WINE REDUCTION\u000a\u000aPaired with creamy mashed potatoes and broccolini, its as if you were eating a steak, and it was perfect rare to medium rare.we were stuffed to the gills and I even tried to summon the Goyemonstah to  finish off wifey's entree and was able to finsh most, but not all of it...a valiant effort though!\u000a\u000aDESSERTS\u000aAs if it wasn't enough already, Rum Cake and Tiramisu were brought to our table, and mysteriously, we had room for dessert and they were gone before you know it!\u000a\u000aAs our night came to a close, Ciro presented us  with our "marriage license" as he said, which was actually a signed dinner menu by Chef Marc which is our tradition for each Anniversary. Big Mahalos to Chef Marc and Team Parma for a great evening and we will see you again for MANGIA!!!-Round 3!....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(276/365) "MANGIA!!!-Round 2.5"

VWe've been to Parma a handful of times- Lunch, Dinner, and for my MANGIA! series.\u000aThis time though, Parma was a lifesaver. I had everything I needed to assemble  the Tiramisu for Vanessa's birthday except for the Ladyfingers.\u000a\u000aWe popped in after shopping at TJ and I grabbed a couple of packs of Ladyfingers($5.99/pack) and I was all set to go. I set up all the ingredients and equipment I needed and wifey lent me a helping hand and busted out the coffee syrup to soak the ladyfingers. We went to Yonaka for Christina and Arvin's UYE, and when we got home, I made the mascarpone filling, assembled the tiramisu quickly, and called it a night.\u000a\u000aNot only did I have enough for the party, I made another smaller Tiramisu for me and wifey to enjoy at home...:)\u000a\u000aThanks again Parma!.....ALOHA!!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(56/100) "Mission Accomplished"

VMy craving for Indian food comes once in a blue moon, and finally that blue moon was shining so bright!....Nah, just kidding, but as far as I can remember, the last times we've had Indian food was the CMYEs at Namaste and Mint, Walking to India Masala after helping set up for the first Nerdy Dancing and most recently, apps at Mantra Masala which was okay.\u000a\u000aThis called for a visit that was long overdue, so we scrolled down the list and picked the highest rated place in town which was Mt. Everest. At $10.99 for a lunch buffet of a pretty good spread that would please just about any palate:\u000a\u000aBasmati and Sweet Rice, Jhukuni Aloo, Vegetable Samosas, Punjabi Kadi, Palak Paneer, Mattar Paneer, Gajar Halwa, Chicken Curry, Goat Curry, Chili Chicken, Chicken Makhani, Tandoori Chicken, Salad Bar, Assorted Chutneys, Naan, and Rice Pudding. I tried every offering once, then went back for seconds and thirds of my favorites, the sweet rice, goat curry, punjabi kadi, and both paneer dishes. Honestly one of the best lunch deals in town.\u000a\u000aService was great, water glasses and our naan basket was replenished quickly, and you can watch and listen to some Bollywood action while enjoying your meal. Looking forward to returning, and this time, no need to wait for that blue moon!.....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuu  4.5\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(38/365) "Bomb Bites And Bollywood Beats"

VWe popped in for a snacky-snack before seeing Zarkana and American Fish has some of the tastiest happy hour bites around.\u000aServed tapas style, all happy hour selections are $5 and drinks are $4-$7\u000aWe shared the Lobster Roll, Fish and Chips, Shrimp and Grits, and Tuna Tartare.\u000a\u000aThe Lobster Roll(more like a slice of brioche) had nice chunks of lobster meat with just enough mayo to bind, a touch of citrus, and topped with chervil which added a nice flavor, the Fish and Chips were nice and crisp on the outside, and soft and flaky on the inside, went very well with the caper-filled tartar sauce. Loved the splash of malt vinegar on the chips as well. The shrimp were very plump and flavorful, and the grits were nice, buttery and cheesey. The crisp rice, micro greens, and wasabi tobiko with the tartare was an explosion of flavors and textures in every bite. Order an ice cold PBR and you get to keep the koozie! Looking to return for\u000adinner as well as trying other HH bites and sweets...ALOHA!!!

VThe Broth is BOMB!!! the service is great, and their summer rolls are awesome because they grill the shrimp and pork, so when you bite into it, you have the char of the grill, warmth of the shrimp and pork, and the coolness of the mint, vermicelli, and lettuce all in one....For all of you hardcore "Phonatics" They offer a challenge...finish a HUGE bowl of Pho, equivalent to 3 XL bowls in 1 hour and its free, OR they'll take your picture and post it on their wall of shame and you''l have to pay $25.00. I can only polish of one of the XL bowls, so I'll save myself the embarassment.\u000a\u000aOh, for all of you Oxtail Soup lovers out there in Yelpland, Pho 87 is the only joint in town that I know offers an OXTAIL PHO! Gotta try that on my next visit....ALOHA!!!

Vwent back a couple of weeks ago and had their chicken pho which was killer with big chunks of chicken breast and toasted shallots which infused the clear broth and made it more flavorful. my wife chose the oxtail pho which was very dissapointing. The oxtail had NO TASTE WHATSOEVER! Tasted like boiled beef in plain water-Nasty! How are you gonna waste a pretty pricey meat like that? They do fresh fruit bobas though(Like #1 Boba) had the coconut which was good with all the bits of young coconut meat....for the very daring, she also does a Durian one too. (pass on that one) Better step it up to get your star back....ALOHA!!!

VWe came across this park a little after we had a little Thrifty's action which is also nearby. Its a neat little park where you could bring your pooch and the family as there are beautiful fields and walkways, a kiddie water activity area, tennis and volleyball areas, and a beautiful waterfall filled with assorted migrating birds and water animals- Mallard and Muscovy Ducks, Turtles, and Canadian Geese were just a few we spotted.\u000a\u000aI do wish that the City and County would do something about the debris in the water though, and maybe hire a couple of toy cops(maybe they were on a doughnut break or something?) to prevent people from feeding the animals which will hurt them in the long run. There is even a sign in front saying not to feed them, but these parents don't care and give their kids bread or other types of human food not suited for these creatures....I just wish there was  a stricter enforcement of these rules, because not everyone sees or understands these rules, which could mess with these birds' migratory process year after year.\u000a\u000aPeople, enjoy the facilities that have been generously provided for our enjoyment...Do not abuse them!...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(43/100) "Duck, Duck Goose"

VAfter getting our Zumba on, I wanted a smoothie to cool down, so using the trusty Yelp App,\u000awe found this location.\u000a\u000aWe were even more thrilled to see a 24 HOUR DRIVE THRU!!!! We also had good service despite many other reviews mentioning not-so-good service.\u000a\u000aMy Hawaiian Breeze sure did hit the spot, and 10% off from showing your LVAC membership card is an added bonus!....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(154/365) "Thirst Aid Station"

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(108/365) "Blast From The Past"\u000a\u000aWe stopped in for a bite after getting cut next door at Hi-Rollers. HPSF is Drugstore/Pharmacy/Diner run by a couple of gentleman, and as you step inside, it is as if you went back in time to the 50's and 60's. It is very spacious with dining booths as well as counter dining if you wish to do so. \u000a\u000aPerusing the menu, it seems like a lot of choices on paper, but they seemed to be out of a few selections as we were inquiring on certain menu items and descriptions.\u000aWifey and I narrowed it down and we split a Cowboy Burger with a couple of shakes.\u000aShe got a Strawberry Shake and I went with the Watusi Whopper. FYI, all burgers, sandwiches, and items that are usually made with meat are not. Every item is vegetarian, and they use veggie meat from Morning Star.\u000a\u000aThe burger and fries were pretty good even though nothing is made in-house, and the shakes were not as thick as I prefer, but decent. Service was good, and price point is reasonable. Stop in if you're in the area and give these guys a try! ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cu  3.25

VWe really don't shop at F&E...Well, we never used to shop at F&E, but all of that has changed for one item..... POG.\u000a\u000aNo, not the milkcap game of the 90's(I still have my collection btw!), the juice I grew up with as a kid.If you're from Hawaii, you know what I'm talkin' about. Yes, this ain't 100% healthy passion-orange guava juice, but it's that nostalgic flavor that local Hawaiians know and love.\u000a\u000aSince this location is minutes from our house, I popped in to grab some butter and a few other things to make my dough for my Jawaiian Meat Pies for David's Potluck UYE. My hands were full, and I was kinda speedwalking on my way to the checkout stand when I passed the juice area and I turned to look, my eyes almost popped out of their sockets, my feet stopped abruptly, and all my butter went flying forward! I had to do a double take and make sure I was seeing "POG" through the glass with that familiar looking Poglodyte(The little Yellow Mascot) with a big smile flashing the Shaka sign at me...I was SO HAPPY!\u000a\u000aI told a worker about the damaged goods and she went and got new boxes of butter for me-what service! I grabbed a couple of bottles of POG and surprised Wifey when I got home. Now its just one less item I have to wait to enjoy when I go back home...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(60/100) "POG...Finally in the 702!"

VAre there any decent Soul Food restaurants in Vegas??? I've slowly lost any remaining hope after stopping in at EllaEm's. SOUL is something that our food most definitely was missing that evening\u000a\u000aWhen we arrived, the restaurant was very clean and looked more inviting than other soul food spots we've dined at(Kathy's, M&M)even the items on the menu looked very appetizing....Looks were definitely deceiving here because after our waitress assured us that everything was delicious, wifey asked "are your ribs juicy and fall-off-the-bone?"\u000a"Oh yeah" she replied with a smile...about 10 seconds later, wifey sees liver and onions on the menu and she excitedly orders that instead.\u000a"Oh, you know what? that's the only item we don't have" waitress says....\u000aGee, thanks for the "heads up" on what you're out of.\u000a\u000aSo she orders the Ribs with 3 sides-mashed potatoes, yams, and mac and cheese and I go with one of their house specialities, Chicken and Waffles. While waiting for our order, we hear BEEP, BEEP, BEEP at least 4-5 times...yes,  that dreadful sound of the microwave was a definite"Oh hell's no!" moment....The cornbread comes out first, but not in huge squares as pictured in the menu, but more like 3-inch circles, 1/2 inch high....WTH? 4 and 5 star reviews????Really????\u000a\u000aSome dude named Pedro was the only cook in the kitchen and I know for a fact, he didn't even take the time nor the patience to turn out tasty Soul Food....makes you wonder how much truth there is to the EllaEm's story and its two patriarchs, Ella Rea Gray, and Aem Upachak(photo of story included)\u000a\u000aAll of the sides and the waffles were definitely nuked,which made the waffles tough and spongy and the ribs were tough, dried out and not juicy at all. We won't be  coming back here...ever. Serving food like that is totally doing the two matriarchs a great injustice...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(25/365) "No soul at all"

VAlthough I am an LVAC member, we decided to have a looksee and got the 3 day pass. After checking out the animals at The Farm, we hurried down for the Zumba class at 10 am.\u000a\u000aWe met up with Arvin C., Christina W, and David S. and Zumba'd for 60 minutes straight. A few things I liked were that there was space to get your groove on. You didn't feel  claustrophobic like a can of sardines and the instructor had steps you could pick up fairly easily although I looked like a rookie standing beside all of the regulars in the class. The song selection was also great and we definitely worked up an appetite for lunch!\u000a\u000aLooking for a place to shake your booty? print out the free three day pass and get your Zumba on here, you may end up becoming a member at this Clean, spacious 24 Hour Fitness Sport!

VAfter hearing Misti and Bobby Y. rave about this place, We finally got to try Namaste during Misti's CMYE in conjunction with the CAC...\u000a\u000aWe shared a Table with fellow Yelpers Tony, Judd, and Lynn. Usually the buffet is only served during lunch hours, but they made an exception for this event.\u000a\u000aIf you haven't been to Namaste within the last 3 months, I STRONGLY suggest you do so...The food was outstanding! They have changed ownership and the person running the show now is Melque (pronounced "milky") Rodriguez. She and her cooks are natives from Goa,\u000aand besides being the owner, she is also a professional singer, and your friendly hostess and server.\u000a\u000aThe buffet had quite a few meat and vegetarian options-saag paneer, veggie samosas, veggie biriyani, tandoori chicken, chicken vindaloo, butter chicken, ghana chat, yellow dal,navratham korma, the list goes on and on.\u000a\u000aafter a good couple rounds, I was happily stuffed and we'll definitely be back to try other items on the menu...ALOHA!!!

VGave Jolibee yet another try at this location, and I'm convinced that I'm not a fan of the overly hyped Chicken Joy. Definitely no joy anywhere on that plate.\u000a\u000aI guess if I grew up on this stuff, it would be a different story. The place is clean, and the service was good, but this Filipino fast food does not appeal to me at all. Yes, this ain't  much of a Yelp approved business, but I'm sure the Filipino community will keep Jolibee from closing up shop.\u000a\u000aThe only thing that may draw me back are their pies, which are the closest thing to Mickey D's old school Apple Pies...ALOHA!!!

VRetro, Vintage, Throwback ,Old-School sodas, candies, toys and more is what Rocket Fizz  is....\u000aIf you want that "kid in the candy store" feeling, stop in and you'll see what I mean.\u000a\u000aYou can't help but feel nostalgic with a big smile while checking out this soda pop and candy shop...vintage signage on every wall, salt water taffy in the back corner, gadgets and trick toys you played with as a kid, sodas from all over the country, and even some imports too.\u000a\u000aZozz candies with the fizzy middle, Wax Lips and Fangs, Big League Chew, Pop Rocks, Abba-Zabba, Bubble Gum "Cigarettes"....all that and more can be found here.\u000a\u000aWe decided to get a six-pack. The more you buy, the cheaper it is per bottle. The wifey chose Green River, Simpson Springs Orange(Creamsicle in a bottle). She also loves cola, but couldn't decide between Virgil's and Moxie Elixir, the oldest cola they have.\u000a\u000a"Would you like to try them?" the owner asked. She had never tasted Moxie either, so we do a head-to-head tasting, Moxie vs. Virgil's.\u000a(Free soda tastings are Wednesdays, 5-8pm and Saturdays, 1-3pm)\u000a\u000aThe Moxie had the taste of cola and prunes followed by a slightly medicinal aftertaste-weird....Virgils had the taste of true cola so we went with Virgil's.\u000a\u000aI'm not big on cola but I do love a good root Beer and old school cream soda, so my choices were the Sioux City Sarsaparilla-"the Grand Daddy of Root Beers",and the Olde Brooklyn Cream Soda. my third pick was some random(Derr's Orange-Pineapple) soda that totally bombed.

VWe dropped by in hopes of finding Atkinson's Peanut Butter Bars(we first tried them From Honey Salt's candy bowl ) and after searching a few minutes, we found it. \u000a\u000aI was also bummed that stores didn't carry Peanut Butter Twix anymore, but now I'm happy that they can also be found at Rocket Fizz.. On our way out, wifey grabbed an RC Cola and I tried a Key Lime Pie soda which was pretty good.\u000a\u000aIf you're searching for a candy or soda pop you grew up with and can no longer find, there's a good chance you'll find it here. If only Now and Later would bring back their bubble gum flavored taffy, and If Tidal Wave Gum came back to life...The Green Apple was my favorite!......ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(3/100) "  Our Retro Return"

VWe stopped by again for Leticia's 1-year anniversary, and this time she had the street closed off block party style. Food and fun for the whole family!\u000a\u000aThere were fun and games for the kids, a mexican candy tent, alcohol tent for the adults, and tasty food by Leticia and her team. All kinds of entertainment filled the night. From Zumba dancers, line dancing, and\u000asome cultural entertainment from Rancho High School Ballet Folklorico, and Chapparal High School's Mariachi Band. Another group was planning to play Rock en Espanol, but it was getting late, and we bailed when they were dealing with sound check issues. all in all, a good night out with the wife.\u000a\u000aCongrats on 1 year Leticia! May you be around for many more years to come, and hopefully take over all the Lindo locations in Vegas.....ALOHA!!!

VPretty solid tacos...the star is the Al Pastor here, paired with pineapple makes a great combination! I also ordered their Lengua, Carne Asada, and Tripas(intestine) fried up crispy with a squeeze of lime and salsa....Addicting! Bummer that the Horchata was instant, and not from scratch.\u000a\u000aLos Parados also serves up other specialities like Menudo, and Tortas Ahogadas which gives me an excuse to return.\u000a\u000aLos Parados gets my vote for Al Pastor and Tripas, but for Carne Asada and Lengua, Los Tacos (also on Sahara, next to Island Style) has the best...ALOHA!!!!

VAwesome place to pick up ingredients-Beautiful produce, great selection of marinated meats and banchan and they even cater to us transplanted 808ers with an island foods section with Hawaiian Sun drinks, local style snacks and candies.\u000a\u000aI'm also thrilled that there is fresh uni available in the seafood section at half the price you would pay for uni nigiri at a sushi bar\u000a\u000aAfter shopping, you could sit down at the food court an feast on some tasty Korean grub. My favorite thing so far is the Bibimdaemyeun(#2)\u000aat Island Style. Russell's wife runs this location while he runs the Sahara location.\u000a\u000aOverall, one of my favorite Asian supermarkets along with 168 and SF\u000adown the street....ALOHA!!!

VThis was Plan B after we weren't able to get some bao action...Lots of high marks on Yelp, so we were eager to try Wendy's.\u000a\u000aLike others have mentioned, clean great service, etc, and the menu items looked good\u000aso we asked our waitress for suggestions and favorites. We ordered the following according to her recommendations:\u000a\u000aSeafood Noodle Soup- pretty standard, okay tasting, and egg noodles were good, but the noodle/broth ratio was off. I was fishing for more noodles in my big bowl of broth.\u000aShanghai Dumplings-One bite of this left a weird aftertaste in the filling. I really wanted to enjoy this, I tried another one, and I was done. We were more grossed out by the fat that solidified on the vinegar dipping sauce a few minutes later.\u000a\u000aWe made the mistake of trying the baked spaghetti which was overly sweet like the Jolibee version which I also don't care for, also with a wierd aftertaste. By the end of our lunch, we were filled more from their delicious hot Jasmine Tea...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(145/365) "Where's the Noodles???"

Wifey gets the same with a Coke...5 minutes later, more customers start coming at 5 minute intervals, and before you know it, there's a line out the door! Talk about perfect timing....Breakfast arrives, and it hits the spot-Crisp outside, fluffy inside, and their secret sauce which is basically a sweetened eggless mayo, ties everything in beautifully...glad we came in before the rush!

VOkay, all week I've been trying to figure out where I wanted to dine out for my birthday, and finally at 3:30pm I decide...Tapas and Paella sounds good, we've been to Firefly a good amount of times, their tapas are good, but their Paella is served to you in A BOWL and nothing really outstanding about it. I'm also one to really shy away from the "brand-name, Celebrity Chef" establishments, but somehow had a good feeling on this one, so my wife had made reservations for 8 pm at Julian Serrano.\u000a\u000aAt the entrance we are greeted by the hostesses and as we are led to our table, you can't help but notice the architecture, accents, and color scheme of JS....Lots of modern touches with colors of orange, gold, and purple.\u000aI'm no HGTV/Design Pro, but I kinda liked the set up and found it inviting without being too over the top. As we pass the kitchen, I see\u000aa good friend, Chef Nathan at the pass. I also remembered that my other friends Jin and Wally worked here, but were both off.\u000a\u000aNathan comes out and greets me and my wife, and offers his recommendations on a few of the menu items. We're both hungry, in the mood for some killer tapas and paella, and what better way to kick it off with a few of the Chef's selections? So we sit back, relax and await our food filled journey through Spain.\u000a\u000aFirst up, the Tuna Raspberry Skewer-The meatiness of the ahi tuna, nuttyness of the sesame seeds and pistachios, and the slight fruity tartness of the molecular raspberry blended very well together...off to a great start!\u000a\u000aNext, we feasted on the Fresh Calamari a la Plancha with lemon, parsley, and extra virgin olive oil. Easily one of the best calamari dishes I ever tasted. Baby squid cooked to perfection and melt-in-your-mouth delicious!\u000a\u000aChef Nathan sends out  an order of the Pintxo de Morcilla, a Spanish blood sausage, and for all you fellow Filipinos out in Yelpland, this is the Spanish version of Diniguan. The sweetness of the tomato and onion compote on the toasted crouton complemented each and every bite\u000a\u000aOrdering a Paella Valenciana ahead of time, we also order some Red Sangria which was pretty powerful and refreshing at the same time. Wanting to try more tapas, we go ahead and order a second wave before our Paella arrives. Apparently our waiter has never met me or know my ability level when I am in attack mode at the dinner table. He not only had a look of disbelief on his face when I mentioned our orders of the Mixed Seafood Ceviche, Crema y Risotto, Lobster and Molecular Pineapple Skewers, Stuffed Dates, and The Traditional Chicken Croquettas. He had to stop bussing our table, put down our dishes back on our table and write it all down. Apparently, I drained all his memory power, but thats what happens when you assume we will have had enough food when our paella arrives:)\u000a\u000aChef Nathan mentioned  that they had hired a cook from Peru who takes care of the ceviche action and Peruvians make some of the tastiest ceviches ever! Just the perfect heat and acidity mixed  into chunks of fish and octopus served with crisp taro chips, very cool and refreshing.\u000a\u000aThe Lobster and Molecular Pineapple skewers were quite tasty with an asian accent as well, definitely a must try.\u000a\u000aThe Crema y Risotto was the star of the tapas. The risotto was cooked perfectly al dente, the earthy meatiness of the mushrooms paired well as always with the truffle oil, cream, and cheese, and transformed my wife into a risotto lover.\u000a\u000aThe Julian Serrano version of Stuffed Dates have a crispy exterior and is paired with a piquillo pepper sauce with a good kick. Addicting.\u000a\u000aThe Croquettas were simple and straight forward. Creamy bechamel with a hint of nutmeg with chunks of chicken encased in a panko crust-YUM!\u000a\u000aHere comes the Paella!  The Valenciana comes loaded with tasty morsels of rabbit, chorizo that is made in house, green beans, peas, peppers and a very fragrant saffron rice. The rabbit was very moist and flavorful and the chorizo had a nice smokiness that we both enjoyed.the saffron rice was bomb too, with that crispy crust you get when your paella is finished in the oven just before serving.\u000a\u000aAs we're looking over the dessert menu, My wife is eyeing the Churros con Chocolate  and WHADDAYA KNOW? Chef Nathan sends out an order:) Crisp exterior, soft inside, and the chocolate dipping sauce is spiked with chili, leaving you with a good heat which is not too overpowering and left us no choice but to devour the chocolate sauce by the spoonful after our churro supply was gone\u000a\u000aOverall, one of my new favorite dining experiences ever. I really don't agree with all these 1 and 2 star reviews that JS has gotten.\u000aNathan, you and your crew ROCK, and the service was outstanding! Hopefully Jin and Wally will be there when we return!\u000a\u000aI know tons of Yelpers rave about Firefly, but if you want the real deal Holyfield, Check out Julian Serrano. You'll be glad you did...ALOHA!!!

VBack again celebrating my sister's boyfriend's birthday, we picked them up from the airport and returned to Julian Serrano anticipating a great dinner by Chef Nathan and his crew.\u000a\u000aWe got our usuals-Calamari a la plancha, mixed seafood ceviche, risotto, stuffed dates, red sangria,etc. meanwhile, we placed an order for paella valenciana, knowing it takes 35 minutes to prepare...our waiter tries to persuade us to order a paella for four, but we kindly decline, so it'll allow us to order more tapas.\u000a\u000aRound two, we get the raspberry tuna skewers, flat iron steak , pan con manchego, and chorizo con huevos y papa which were all tasty. Finishing up round two, Our waiter busts out the DESSERT MENUS!?\u000a\u000aWe remind him of our Paella Valenciana and homeboy FORGOT TO PLACE THE ORDER! Luckily for him, we were all in a good mood, so his mistake didn't ruin our evening, and it was chef Nathan to the rescue again, sending out an order of croquettas and tuna tiradito to hold us over.\u000aThe Paella was tasty as usual, and gone in a matter of minutes...\u000a\u000aThe best part of the night was when we didn't order desserts because we had Rudy's cake coming...Complete with a firework candle, that cake was the center of attention in the dining room. All you could see was a big smile from ear to ear, and Rudy repeatedly saying "That's frickin' bad-ass!"\u000a\u000aThat cake looked and tasted great...most of all, it made Rudy's night a memorable one as well. After soaking it all in, and beginning to get teary-eyed, He leans over to Lorena and says,\u000a"I'm 29 years old, and I've never gotten a birthday cake."\u000a\u000aWell, there's always a first for everything, and I'm glad I got to give him that moment he'll remember forever.....ALOHA!!!

VWalked down to Herbs and Rye after Island style for  Happy Hour and this place was packed.\u000a\u000aPretty good food, and great hand crafted drinks....the bone in ribeye was solid as was the sweet potato tater tots, but the desserts were a slight dissappointment.\u000a\u000aThe Chocolate Lava Cake wasn't even flowing and the "fresh batch" of doughnuts were straight up Pilsbury Biscuits that you can get at the grocery store(AKA Ghetto Malassadas as known by us Hawaiians)\u000a\u000ago for the food and drinks, but I would think twice on the dessert...ALOHA!!!

VCame here after we had some tiki drinks at Frankie's. Kinda slim pickins for HH, but we were hella hungry. I got the bone in Kansas Steak, wifey got the Wedge Salad, and we split the Steak and Arugula Flatbread with Truffle Vinaigrette(not on HH menu, but we got it anyway). We also shared the Sweet Potato Tots and Truffle Mac and Cheese with fellow Yelpers at our table\u000a\u000aSteak was a perfect medium rare and the truffley goodnes of the flatbread was tasty, so was the wifey's salad...I love blue cheese dressing that "sticks" to your food and doesn't flow like a bad mess.\u000athe sides were okay, not something I'd order again, just like their desserts...ALOHA!!!

VAfter Misti Y.'s Hall Monitor CMYE, a few of us decided to walk across to the Riviera for some India Masala action. Its location is kinda odd being part of a food court than a free standing restaurant.\u000a\u000aTheir menu is pretty extensive, offering curries, dosas, and vegetarian items as well. I split the Tandoori grill Combo with the wifey and the portions were pretty generous, but the price ($15) was pretty steep for a food court entree\u000a\u000aTaste is everything and every bite was delicious as was the naan and chutneys that came with our order. we don't frequent Indian dining spots as much (because my stomach is craving Goyemon most of the time)\u000abut I'd like to return to try their other items...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(15/365) "Namaste!"

VWhen in Chinatown, 168 and Greenland are my usual stops, but SFLVS will now be added to my grocery shopping rotation!\u000a\u000aHUGE produce section, Oodles of all kinds of noodles, rice, teas, and so many other cool things I've never seen or heard of! Be adventurous and check out each aisle...I've been able to hunt down Pinipig(pounded rice flakes) here which is an essential ingredient in Halo-Halo(Thanks for NOTHING estupid seapood city!)\u000a\u000aLive Mudbugs, Catfish, Tilapia, and Dungeness Crab are just a few things they have available at their seafood section and there's also a food court inside to get your grub on afterwards. If you're not that hungry and just want a little snacky snack, they have Balut up at the cash register-YUM!(NOT!!!)  ALOHA!!!

VCame back to the Cosmo recently...Not to swim, go clubbing, or grab a slice of \u000aSecret(ly pathetic) Pizza-Yeah, I am not a fan of that place(read my review!)\u000a\u000aThis time, we secretly gathered by Wicked Spoon to go up to one of the rooms with the wrap around balcony.We all patiently waited for the Birthday Girl(Vanessa N.) to arrive and we surprised the heck out of her! \u000a\u000aThis room had sweet amenities and enough space to chat up a storm, feast on some Pan Asian, and even play hide and seek!(Ask David and Santiago!) The balcony gave you a great view of the strip and you could also lounge outside and grab some fresh air.\u000a\u000aThe bedroom was more like a chat room of sorts where we reflected on the first time we had met one another and all the good times we had at various Yelp events,and even the future events that are yet to come....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(57100) "Surprised!"

VWe returned this time to the pool to see Henry Churches,err....Enrique Iglesias in concert.(Thanks Regina!!!) The pool area was packed, but we found space towards the back, pretty far from the stage, but it was all good.\u000a\u000aNot a personal fan of Mr. Iglesias, but it was a good time listening to him perform live. He sang all his great hits, and instead of pulling your typical groupie chick on stage, a dude, and a little girls night was made as they were lucky fans that got to join him on stage.\u000a\u000aAfter a DJ number and more hits, a confetti shower signified the end of the show. luckily we were close to the doors leading downstairs to avoid the huge crowd.  ALOHA!!!

VThis is another hidden gem in the Sunrise area, and now that I've been to every La Flor De Michoacan in town, I must say that this is my favorite one, because its a restaurant and ice cream shop in one! Not only do they offer Ice cream, sorbet, and agua fresca...\u000a\u000aPizza, Burgers, Chicken Wings, and Fries? They have those here...\u000a\u000aChicago Dogs, and Mexican style street dogs? They have these here too...\u000a\u000aSalvadoran and Oaxacan specialities? They have these here too....\u000a\u000aSmoothies, Frappes, and Boba Teas....BOBA TEAS!?!?!? Yup, they sell these too!\u000a\u000aThis location is clean and spacious, and you can even play Ms. Pac Man or watch TV here! Not only do they have all the flavors of the Charleston location, they have sweets and imported snacks from Mexico, and Chamoy sorbet, which is a tart sauce used on some of LFMs creations. Believe it or not, they even have a flavor named William Levy,(He's the one shmoozing poolside with the M&M, and a Dancing with the Stars finalist) after the "Latin Brad Pitt" LOL!!!! How's that for a unique flavor!?!?\u000aThe Ice creams, sorbets and snacks offered here are so plentiful, you could seriously have a meal and dessert in one sitting, and not feel cramped up like the other locations.\u000a\u000aI finally decided on my usual Pine Nut and Cajeta, and wifey got Pine Nut and Rice Pudding. Always a cool bonus with the free toppings. As we were enjoying our ice cream, one of the workers were nice enough to give us a sample of some Pastel de Queso(Mexican Cheesecake) which was dense, rich, and smooth. I can't wait to return to try their hot dogs, Oaxacan specialities, and of course, more ice cream!....ALOHA!!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(51/100) "Tricked Out Sweet Shop"

VBack again, this time to try their savory items (and more ice cream of course!)\u000a\u000aWe were intrigued by the Tlayuda, a Oaxacan speciallity that looked like a pizza-Baked tortilla, black beans, cheese, onion lettuce, tomato, and avocado topped with a piece of carne asada, and chorizo. We also wanted to try one of their Hot Dogs. They had a Chicago style one, one called the Titanic, and another one called Chupale Pichon which means(according to the urban dictionary) "Suck my d**k"...Now why would you name it that when kids come in here too? Kinda awkward if a kid asks his parent for that!?!? Oh well...\u000a\u000aOf the two items we got, the Titanic Hot Dog was the better one with bacon, onions, avocado, and sour cream. I'd probably get this again.The Tlayuda had good taste, but the tortilla had a stale texture instead of a nice crunch I was expecting.\u000aNot something I'd order again. Our ice cream treats kinda made up for it in the end...whew!   ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(78/100) "Street Dogs and Sweets"

VAfter shopping around during the Yelp Local Cash Mob Event, there were about 12 yelpers remaining from from the original 20-25 shoppers and we all met up at Grimaldi's for the after party.\u000a\u000aWe all recieved a $5 gift card to use towards any additional purchase towards additional food and alcohol. The pizzas and cannolis we pigged out on were compliments of Grimaldi's.\u000a\u000aWe shared a small house salad while we were waiting for the pizzas and it was pretty huge for a small! The pizzas came out and we had 5 large pizzas-2 Cheese, 1 Sausage, 1 Pepperoni, and 1 White. This is not my favorite kinda pizza, but it was pretty decent. I personally prefer a more thicker, chewy crust like NY or Neapolitan style. Toppings were also pretty good, and my favorite one was the White Pizza.(Rocco's House White still gets my vote though). One of the managers later came out with a tray of Cannolis and said "don't be shy", so everyone had about 2 or 3 and there were still leftovers!\u000a\u000aService was awesome, and it was a great way to cap off a day of shopping local...ALOHA!!!

VBoba City Cafe is my favorite place in town. I prefer this place to #1 Boba Tea.\u000a\u000aBoba City's drinks are much more flavorful and consistent every time I've stopped in. The owners are very friendly and hospitable, and each time I've gone, I've gotten to try a little sample of a fresh fruit smoothie. This time, it was pineapple, AND IT WAS GOOOOOOD!\u000a\u000aBoba City also uses fresh fruit in their drinks, and their portion sizes are pretty good too. I always get a large, but I still think its too small!\u000a\u000aHaven't tried any of their savory food items or interesting ice cream flavors(Durian Gelato!?) But I finally got to try  some Delimanjoo, a bite sized cream filled cake that is totally addicting! \u000a\u000aIn the mood for boba? This is where its at...ALOHA!!!

VLet me just say that I don't frequent Starbucks or the other big coffee chains on a daily basis however, I love a good cup of coffee especially when I know its from Colorado River Coffee Roasters. I was first turned on to CRCR by good friend and former owner of Bread and Butter Chris Herrin. A few months later while dining at Eat in downtown, I enjoyed that same delicious smooth cuppa joe,(unfortunatey, both B&B and Eat no longer use them) and knowing that they were in Boulder City, I knew one of these days I HAD TO go straight to the source.\u000a\u000aPulling up to their storefront, it looks like nothing from the outside but as you enter, the smell of roasting coffee beans hit you like WOW!!! We met Don and Erik Anderson who are responsible for making some of the most delicious coffee you will have ever tasted(if you haven't yet). They were even nice enough to give us a little behind the scenes tour and explain their delicate roasting process using state of the art equipment (infrared heat, not open fire) and even offered tips on how to enjoy their product in the best possible way. We decided to grab a bag of one of Eirk's favorite blends-Bolivia: Amor De Dios, a 12 ounce bag for $10. If you're looking for a specific characteristic, flavor, etc. they have other blends available and Erik will be more than happy to point you in the right direction.\u000a\u000aIf you haven't had a taste of Colorado River Coffee Roasters, places like Grouchy John's, Great Harvest Bread Company, and Sambalatte have their own blends from CRCR that they serve up. You may also purchase coffee from CRCR online which will be delivered right to your doorstep, or better yet, take a drive to Boulder City and go straight to the source and get an even fresher product!\u000a\u000aHere are some helpful tips that Erik and Don suggested:\u000a\u000aCOFFEE: DO NOT grind the beans fine...a coarse grind is suggested\u000a\u000aWATER: DO NOT boil your water!... 200 degrees Farenheit... no higher!\u000a\u000aEQUIPMENT: No fancy equipment/gadgets here- a FRENCH PRESS is their weapon of choice, and how Erik and Don enjoy the fruits of their labor....\u000a\u000aDOSAGE: Start with an equal ratio of 1 gram beans to 1 gram water and steep for \u000a4 minutes...if it isn't strong enough, increase the beans to your liking\u000a\u000aSTORAGE: Store beans in a cool, dark place....DO NOT refrigerate or freeze!!!\u000a\u000aBEST BY: Enjoy within 1 MONTH of purchase\u000a\u000a\u000aErik and Don have also been chosen as one of the top seeded companies to compete later this year on the National level in Seattle with the best in the country.\u000aBest of luck to Erik and Don who have single handedly put Nevada on the coffee map, and forget the big chains....BUY LOCAL!!!!    ALOHA!!!

VThe Company and decor  here were better than the food and service...bottom line.\u000a\u000aWe stopped in for lunch with a bunch of yelpers and I decided to go with the Shortrib Enchilada.  It was good, but a little skimpy on the portion, and priced pretty high for what you get. I guess when you got Rick Bayless attached to a restaurant, then its justified? Nope, not for me\u000a\u000aThe sevice was pretty bad, and left a bad impression too...don't tell us you CANNOT split checks when your dumba$$ just split some checks within our party!\u000a18% auto gratuity??? one of the stupidest policies ever created....never a fan, especially when a server knows that's already "locked in" whether mistakes are made or not. They totally didn't deserve it.\u000a\u000aI'll stick to local mom and pop joints and even the streets, where they serve up Mexican food with SOUL....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(77/100) "All Show, No Go"

We shared the Beef Chow Fun and The Garlic Chicken. Looking for a quick hot meal that's filling?

VI would always hit up Tower Records in search of music, movies, and collectibles, and sadly when the whole TR empire went belly up, that was the beginning of the end for these media stores. Fye is one of the last standing stores along with ZIA of its kind.\u000a\u000aPeople still come in here, but its more just to browse or buy clothing of their favorite artist or celebrity. who needs CDs and DVDs when we have the internet and Pandora, right? Too bad businesses like these are slowly disappearing. Check 'em out while you can, it'll soon become a thing of the past...ALOHA !!!

Vgood place...just don't let them get you with their fresh fruit hook. They should rephrase their business motto to "With your health in mind, we use fresh fruits and C&H cane sugar in your drinks" \u000a\u000aYes they're definitely way above the "powdered" operations, but each and every boba drink served is with C&H cane sugar. The stacks of bags are there as you walk in and no, its not there just for decoration.\u000a(see my photos...)\u000a\u000aboba was okay, but borderline mushy. looking at other reviews, they seem to have an issue with the consistency of their product....Best in town? Hmmmmmm, I'll have to return to decide....ALOHA!!!

VYEAH BABY! a boba tea joint that finally serves a 32 oz boba drink!!!\u000a\u000aWe stopped in for a drinky drink since we haven't had boba drinks for a while. its cool to see that N1B has gotten a little facelift with new pictures outside and an updated menu inside. the ladies inside are nice and are willing to even make a custom flavor off the menu.\u000a\u000aI included a few pictures on the sneak tip to avoid being put on blast like others have...whew! mission accomplished! Boba drinks are also categorized-milk teas, smoothies, mixed(more than one flavor) and now hot boba teas are available, but only in 24 oz. size....The hot coconut boba tea is bomb!!!\u000a\u000aI broke away from my usual flavors(Taro and Avocado) and decided to try the Coconut-Lychee Boba smoothie, 32oz. of course, so yummy with bits of lychee jelly mixed in,and wifey ordered her special concoction-Chocolate, Strawberry, and Banana Boba Smoothie. First, the ladies had a look of confusion, then started clowning wifey's order, and finally gave the nod of approval after they all tasted the "Sylvia Special"...See, don't knock it 'til you try it:) \u000a\u000aNow the question is.....Will it last the drive home????ALOHA!!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(146/365) "Supersize It!"

VReturned yet again wanting to try a different flavor, so this time, I went the American smoothie route and ordered a peanut butter and banana boba and wifey got a watermelon smoothie with lychee jelly which was very good and refreshing.\u000a\u000aMine on the other hand was good, but I think I'll skip the peanut butter and stick to Asian fruits and ingredients when it come s to a boba smoothie...just my personal preference. The boba here is alwas warm with a nice chewiness, and the service has been great...yes, we'll definitely be back!...ALOHA!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(171/365) " Bobalicious Goodness"

V2 updates in one...\u000a\u000aWe were in the area, and I decided to take Mom and Pop to my favorite Boba joint. I always rotate between Avocado, Taro, and Lychee-Coconut, so I got a Lychee-Coconut, and Mom and Pop shared an Avocado boba smoothie.\u000a\u000aThey didn't know what to expect, because according to their boba  experiences in Hawaii, they were not impressed. After their first taste, they were hooked and before you know it, it was all gone! As we left, Mom thanked the lady and added "This is better than what we get in Hawaii!" I gotta agree, on my trips back home, I haven't come across boba drinks that even come close...\u000a\u000aWe returned again during the Chinese New Year Festival and this time, the line was out the door! Luckily we were able to grab a table among all the chaos.\u000aWhile we were enjoying our boba smoothies, a stomach-twisting stench filled the air, and I see this mom and her baby boy in line about 2 feet away from our table\u000aand immediately, I put two and two together and falsely accused this baby of crapping his diaper...Boy, was I WRONG!!! Dude, I honestly thought it was the baby because I couldn't see anything else going on up front because it was PACKED! Guilty by association? My bad!!!\u000a\u000aA few LOOONG minutes later, the lady behind the counter shouts "Durian Smoothies!?!? A lady comes up and grabs two Durian boba smoothies **barf sound**\u000aPoor person she kissed or talked to after she enjoyed her smoothie...EEEEWWW!\u000aALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(61/100) "Du-durian...The Dirty Diaper Fruit"

VFinally got to stop in and see what all the Yelpers were talking about....Sin City, along with Sushi Mon on Silverado Ranch and Maryland are my Favorites for AYCE joints.....Fresh seafood, awesome service from Jesse(Wayne's son) Jimbo, and Milton\u000aand NO LONG WAIT(like it can be @ Sushi Mon) was even nicer!\u000a\u000aWe sat up at the bar and met up with Jesse...Immediately we get introduced to the rest of the Sin City Staff and not even 5 minutes later, we are given a plate of marinated baby tako(octopus) which was very tasty and was devoured in 5 minutes...Sin City offers a pretty extensive menu from your familiar nigiri action to sushi rolls and sides, and while browsing the menu, Jesse says, "you can order off the menu, or we can just feed you" COOL!!! Omakase style????We're DOWN!!!\u000a\u000aSo the boys start off by sending out some rolls(no half roll options here)\u000aTiger\u000aWet Dream\u000aVolcano\u000aAfter Round 1, the sides start coming\u000aBaked Greenshell Mussels\u000aAgedashi Tofu\u000aJesse's Oyster Shooters\u000aNext, we move on to some Nigiri action\u000aUni(the best looking "tongues" I've seen and tasted!)\u000aHamachi\u000aSaba\u000aIkura\u000aHotate\u000aNow for some Hand Rolls...\u000aSalmon Skin(Chicharron)-so good, one of my new favorites\u000aNo Name-fried calamari, tuna, avocado, crab, masago and eel sauce\u000aDessert Time...\u000aRed Bean Mochi Ice Cream\u000aTempura Banana with Vanilla Ice Cream\u000a\u000aOverall, great first time at Sin City....We'll definitely be back...ALOHA!!!

VOkay, we've been here about 2 or 3 more times since my last review and its always been consistent as far as the food and service goes...what's very cool is that you are not on a 60 minute time frame to eat all the sushi you can, Jesse and da boyz like to "talk story" and that makes you feel more appreciated as a customer and you don't feel that they're watching you and the time so that they can turn tables and make as much money as possible.\u000a\u000aWe took my sister and her boyfriend this time, and Jesse hooked it up as usual and we all had a great time.\u000a\u000aNothing negative to say about this place, and I love their "you can order from the menu, or we can just feed you" style of all you can eat as well...\u000aLooking forward to seeing all you fellow Yelpers Tuesday night....ALOHA!!!

V*100th Yelp review*\u000a\u000aHere's another Hawaiian-owned business that is run by local girl and good friend, Carolyn Portuondo.\u000a\u000aCaked Las Vegas is located right next door to Sushi-Mon on Silverado Ranch and Maryland Parkway in Green Valley.\u000a\u000aCarolyn and her team will meet all your needs from desserts and cupcakes, to wedding cakes and custom sculpted cakes.\u000aSo my sister Lorena and her boyfriend Rudy were flying down for his birthday, and I was thinking of something to get him.\u000a\u000aKnowing he was a soccer fanatic, I thought how about a soccer ball cake? That would totally make his day! I dropped by Caked to see Carolyn\u000aabout Rudy's cake and gave her the actual soccer ball she was going to reproduce in cake form and on my way out I couldn't resist but to pick up some cupcakes to take home and share with Sylvia, so of course, I got the Haupia, Guava, Lilikoi, Nutella, and Pumpkin, one of her seasonal specials.\u000a\u000a\u000aEach cupcake was delicious!(had to get 2 Haupia-ate 1 on the way home:P)\u000aSoft, moist and full of flavor, all of them were ONOLICIOUS!!!!\u000a\u000aand so was Rudy's cake! Mahalo Carolyn for also delivering the cake to Julian Serrano...Believe me, ALL eyes were on his cake and it definitely\u000awas a birthday for him to remember.....Check out my update for Julian Serrano for Pix of Rudy's cake....ALOHA!!!

V3 stars because they were serving a VERY VERY limited menu....(They closed down on June 18th and are moving to a location in Chinatown-Good Luck!) no sushi, and 3/4 of their menu wasn't available...we settled for the quail eggs, chicken yakitori, shishito peppers, short ribs(nothing but fat...),butter potato,(don't know why we paid for a MICROWAVED potato) Okinawan Pancake, tempura purple sweet potatoes, and grilled corn which was the best thing of all the items we ordered, Oh, the Monkfish liver was pretty dissappointing as well...not even close to Ichiza, Raku, or En...ALOHA!!!

Not a bad deal at all!\u000aThe Spazmatics have done a pretty good job at covering 80s hits for the past six years, from Depeche Mode, Devo, Kenny Loggins, Billy Idol, Salt N Pepa, and many many more! You can even look the part and dress up in your 80s best! It's great to see people just having a great time dancing the night away to one of the best decades ever, and even the music during intermission was awesome! We even got to the dance floor for a few songs and had a complete blast!\u000a\u000aWe left before the Prom King and Queen were crowned, but we heard later that Ty and Lore whooped some A$$ and didn't have to flash some cougar hooha to win...TME(too much exposure) fer' sure dude, like TOTALLY!

VSo I did make it down to Atomic #7 on opening day, but so bummed I missed out on the CYME event (Sorry Misti! We were SLAMMED @ Jean-Philippe Patisserie) As you step in, you see the staff all dressed in lab coats and safety glasses, kinda like science lab class...Anyway, I wanted to see the liquid nitrogen action, which only happens when you do the create your own ice cream, so I ordered a super nova scoop of the bananas foster Ice cream with no other mix ins because I was told that it was pretty powerful in flavor. My wife ordered a hot chocolate pudding. So they go to work on our order, the pudding is steaming away, and the liquid nitrogen is on full blast, and abuot 8-10 minutes later, they are delivered to us. As much as I was looking for my tastebuds to sing, it just fell short...very minimal taste of banana, and the pudding was okay...seemed like deja vu of Bachi Burger, Awesome sounding concept falling short on the execution. As with every new establishment, it just needs a little fine tuning, then they'll be okay.....ALOHA!

VI May have finally found my new favorite breakfast place!!!! After disappointments at the Cracked Egg and the highly overrated Babycakes Cafe, Du-Par's, thank you for setting up shop in Vegas!\u000a\u000aTucked away in the Golden Gate Casino at the Fremont Street Experience, Du-Pars has occupied this spot since March, and on our first visit, this place was pretty packed. I instantly loved the old school diner feel, staff dressed in old school diner attire, Pies and Pastries made in house, so far so good...\u000a\u000aBrowsing the menu, The wifey goes for the blue plate special-1 egg, 2 strips of bacon and 2 pancakes. I choose to go with two eggs, corned beef hash, and hash browns with toast.I request to have my hash browns and corned beef hash "crispy" and  I also order a single pancake because I gotta have savory AND sweet for breakfast.....that's just how I attack....we also order 2 fresh squeezed orange Juices, and this is probably the best OJ in town because they do it up like the farmer's market in LA with the PROPER JUICE ORANGE, THE VALENCIA ORANGE, not Minute Maid, not Tropicana, and not even fresh Navel orange like Jamba Juice..You feel me????\u000a\u000aAndrea drops off our juices and my toast and asks"what kind of jam would you like for your toast? We have Peach, Strawberry, and Boysenberry...I'm thinkin' homeade jams?????BONUS!!! So I ask to try all three and she says "No Problem" There's nothing like home made jam to go with your toast and all 3 ROCKED! the Strawberry was a little too sweet, but tons better than  the Smucker's packets you find everywhere else.\u000a\u000aSo Andrea drops off the wifey's order and my single pancake and says" I sent back your plate Hun, The Hash wasn't crispy enough"\u000aIn most cases, they serve you your order when it comes up...MAJOR props to Andrea!  So we both tear into our pancakes and we both cannot stop shaking our heads on how LEGENDARY(as it states on the menu, since 1938) these buttermilk pancakes tasted! Nice golden brown and the fluffiest pancakes ever!( Check my picture!) Meanwhile, the rest of my breakfast arrives, and its perfection as well-Hash browns crisp outside, creamy inside, and Corned beef hash isn't mush from a can\u000aand perfectly cooked to my liking. Great first time, and it most definitely won't be the last. I still have yet to try lunch, dinner, desserts, pies, and pastries! Another good thing is that they are ALWAYS OPEN... If your idea of pancakes are  at Babycakes, this place ain't for you....ALOHA!!!

VStopped in to check out the Red Umbrella Diaries event and we grabbed a seat out in the back patio. We started off with a couple of drinks- a sangria for the wifey, and I love me a good mojito...the sangria was pretty good, but my mojito was no bueno, I didn't even finish it.\u000a\u000aWe also decided to grab a couple of tapas to try-our waitress swore by the crabcakes and the fish tacos, so we went with her recommendations. The Crabcakes were excellent and paired well with the sauces and mixed greens.\u000aThe fish tacos on the other hand were a joke. for $10 you got a deconstructed plate of  3 mini tortillas, a small piece of fish, a sliver of pineapple with tons of slaw and salsa. This one was also no bueno.\u000a\u000aThe atmosphere here is cool though, like a very condensed version of First Friday.\u000aafter the Red Umbrella Diaries, Oneness Vibe provided some reggae beats, artists were painting, people were chilaxing by the bonfire, and we hung out with Angela H. and her pal, Jen F., and Joe L. Great hangout, but I'd probably hit up the street vendors who are on the same street, and serve up some of the tastiest tacos in town...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(202/365) " A+ For Atmo"

VSo we finally made it out for Sunday Brunch for this highly yelped establishment. After about a 30 minute wait, we were seated.\u000a\u000aWhoa, the noise level inside is CRAZY!!! The reason? ALCOHOL...This place makes for hilarious people watching too. To our left, we have the ladies from "Waiting to Exhale" Laughing and screaming at the top of their lungs(they already have doggie bags but stay to get their drink on)\u000a\u000aTo our back, we have the cast of "The Real World" with the openly flamboyant one telling everyone in the dining room his business (also with doggie bags, also gettin' their mimosa on)\u000a\u000aEnough about the drama around us, we came here for the food...Yelp reviews talk highly about the Pastry basket, so we went with that. we saw the French Toast and Pancakes come out of the kitchen, but luckily, I saw a tip from Jewelyn T.(Mahalo Sistah!) saying the pancakes and french toast wasn't all that,(and my Hawaiian Sweet Bread French Toast kicks any french toast's ass anyway! buahahaha!) so we asked our waiter about the most popular items.."The Chilaquiles and Chicken and Waffles are TO DIE FOR!"....Hmmm...UPSELL MUCH??? Wifey saw a steak and eggs benedict on the table next to us and our waiter said "Those are so popular, we just 86'd them." so she got the Chilaquiles, and I wanted a sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries. The BLT is what he suggested, so I went with that.\u000a\u000a15 minutes later, our pastry basket comes out nice and warm, Guava Goat Cheese Tart-BANGIN'! Cinnamon Muffin-YUM!, Banana Toffee Scone-WOW! So far, so good\u000a\u000aBUT...\u000a\u000aChilaquiles arrives, looks better than it tastes, you can't identify the tortillas because it is a mushy mess under the fried eggs, and it was overkill on the spice.\u000a\u000aBLT Comes out, Bacon is more like jerky, Heirloom Tomatoes are a nice surprise, but the toasted brioche is dry and sandy, not soft and toasty...good ingredients, poor execution. Sweet Potato Fries are stone cold so I send them back. 6-8 minutes later,\u000ainstead of fresh bright orange fries, they're a mix of crisp burnt ones and soggy new ones. Even Mickey D's and In-N-Out don't RE-FRY their fries! Totally disappointed, we just ask our waiter for our check. Screams come from the Waiting To Exhale table because one of them knocked over her mimosa...then CRASH! the Real World table drops two bottles of hot sauce all over the floor and the flamboyant one does a "two snaps up with a circle, followed by an OHHH SHIT!!!!It was a very long 20 minutes before we finally received our bill, after our waiter topped of both tables mimosas yet again without paying attention to any signs of public drunkenness and the fact that these people will get behind the wheel???\u000a\u000aHe also delivered a Steak and Eggs Benedict to the table next to us..86'd MY ASS!!!! I still would like to see what lunch and dinner are all about, so right now I'm giving DW Bistro the benefit of the doubt..right now, its A-ok at 3 stars.....The ball is in your court for that 4th or 5th star....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(341/365) "Dissed @ DW"

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(172/365) "Lured By Patron"\u000a\u000aSo we finally decided to give DW Bistro one more try for Marie's birthday a while back, again for Sunday Brunch and totally pushing my first visit experience aside, Wifey ordered the special Jerk Chicken Benedict and I went for the New Mexican Slow Cooked Pork Bowl.\u000a\u000aThe Jerk spices on the chicken got a little tiring with more bites, and the dry cornbread and soft boiled(again, not correctly poached) egg didn't make this dish any better. The pork bowl was huge in potion size, kinda like a Caribbean style loco-moco, full of spice, but lacking salt. I actually had to ask for the salt shaker and I'm not one to sprinkle additional salt on my food! \u000a\u000aUnfortunately, the company we had was much better than the food we ordered, and we had such a blast that our noise level got up to 100 decibels(yup,someone broke out a decibel meter on their smartphone!) and after 3 hours we got the boot. How?\u000aOur waiter tells us "My boss would like to offer you guys free Patron shots....out on the patio. Nice way of freeing up the tables...great, more alcohol knowing that a few people in our party were already plastered from unlimited mimosas inside. I just hope one of DW Bistro's guests don't cause an accident or fatality on the road. ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuu  2.5

VOriginally was suppposed to be an update for El Pastorcito because we had our minds set(Don't you HATE when that happens?) on their kick-ass Al Pastor Tacos(A good replacement for those of you who miss what Los Parados served up)Luckily, we called and found out they weren't open for business over the phone.\u000a\u000aSo El Pollo Loco was plan B....I'd never been, its close by, so WTH, let's go...\u000aWe pulled up and there was a traffic jam in drive thru. we step inside and its packed as well, and the chicken on the grilled smelled good...Grilled chicken combo it is!\u000a\u000aI love me some legs and thighs(all you horn dogs get your minds out the gutter!) and the sides(corn cake, mash, slaw, beans, tortillas,etc) were aight...salsas were decent for a chain, but its all about  that crazy chicken!\u000a\u000aIMHO, The Crazy Chicken Kicks BOTH the Colonel's(KFC) and the Bee's(Jolibee)a$$ses!.....ALOHA!!!

VGreat place to grab a pie-crust is thin, chewy, and crispy at the same time, service is great, and the prices are reasonable...another favorite are their homemade garlic potato chips. At 75 cents for a basket, you can't go wrong with that. Definitely way better than the Doritos or Ruffles "Big Grab" bags which cost more and are half filled with air.\u000a\u000aDefinitely be back for more...I'm only 5 minutes away....ALOHA!!!

VThis venue is great for people who enjoy outdoor lawn type seating for an event. I've attended a food festival, Reggae in the Desert, and most recently the Jazz in the Park Series.\u000a\u000aThe coliseum-style seating is great too because everyone has a good view of the stage practically from any where you are seated, the grass is soft, and when the sun goes down, its pretty well lit.\u000a\u000aA bunch of us got together and did a potluck on the lawn while listening to the legendary Jazz artist Earl Klugh. This FREE event also allows you to bring low back lawn chairs, blankets, and even picnic items and alcohol at no additional charge...who else does that???\u000a\u000aFor all you Reggae music fans, Reggae in the Desert is just around the corner, but be warned that you may feel a little Irie at the end of the evening from concert goers who'll bring Mary Jane to the party and be passin' that dutchie......ALOHA!!!

I'm a food collectible/action figure junkie like that...\u000a\u000aThe price was right and the delivery was free...can't complain about that.\u000a\u000aIf you're looking to get rid of anything, give it to Colleen's, they may be able to turn it into cash for you...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE(35/365)"Second hand finds"

VBachi Burger is creating alot of buzz and for just being open for about 3 weeks now, the fan base is growing everyday. Growing up in Hawaii, a hibachi (local-style charcoal grill) is very common in just about every hawaiian household, and is how the name came about.\u000aupon entering, you are greeted by local bruddahs and sistahs, yup owned and run by Hawaiians, so it made this Pearl City boy feel right at home:) Looking at the menu, my eyes were getting bigger than my opu(stomach) I wanted to try one of  everything, but we settled for an Apple-Lychee soda, A Cherry Yuzu Soda, and an order of the Short Rib Steamed Buns. Both sodas were very refreshing and the short rib steamed buns, FRICKIN' ONO! I could have at least polished off 3 more plates,easy. They forgot the boiled egg as described in the menu, but I was too busy enjoying the melt-in your mouth wagyu short rib paired with the bite and tanginess of the horseradish yuzu aioli\u000aSo for our entrees, My wife ordered  Kiki's Burger and I ordered the Ronin(you had me at fried egg!) You also gotta understand, When you speak Uni, Foie Gras, and Truffle, you are speaking my language, so of course, we ordered some truffle parmesan fries to go with the burgers. I'm no truffle racist, so the scent of black or white truffle permeating the dining room is music to my nose and stomach. the fries arrived to our table and immediately we dug in..."burgers will be right out" says Lance or waiter and local boy from Waialua....Right now I have tunnel vision savoring each bite of the truffle parmesan fries with crispy bits of sun dried tomato, and paired with the addicting sun dried tomato aioli...another sista comes up saying" did you guys order anything else?" we say yes, a Kiki's and a Ronin" at this point, we're at the bottom of the cone holder, and no burgers in sight....The waitstaff all have a look of "Houston we have a problem!" Then another bruddah comes up and says your burgers are coming right out." 5 minutes later the burgers arrive...The Kiki burger is a beautiful explosion of mushroom, bacon onion, and gruyere cheese, slather some of that garlic chili on the brioche bun.....DA WINNAH!!!!\u000aMy Ronin burger was okay. the slaw was a little bit lacking,and the texture of my burger was like biting into a dense meatloaf. The egg wasn't doing it justice either. On top of that, no fries to go with our burgers:(  Then that familiar smell permates the air again, and ANOTHER bruddah arrives at our table, and says "The chef thought you might be hungry so here's another order" Nice save from the timing issues! So with always having room for dessert, we go for the Portuguese Doughnuts, AKA Malassadas with the Coffee Gelato and I ask for a side of the White Chocolate Yuzu Gelato...Sorry, but the Gelato were the stars for dessert. Anyone from Hawaii knows that Leonard's and Champions are the Malassada standard...Too bad you can only get it on Oahu :(    I only know of one person who makes White Chocolate Yuzu Gelato, and after further investigation, I was correct...The Gelato comes from** Ice Boutique and World Pastry Champion Patrice Caillot...All in all, great concept, just maybe a little fine tuning on the food end as well as the service staff too. We'll return once the "opening kinks" are ironed out:)\u000a\u000a** Ice Boutique is a Wholesale operation here in town, and to enjoy Patrice Caillot's other fantastic flavors, you can pick some up at Whole Foods....ALOHA!!!!

VWe hit up BB after the Yelp Olympics, and after some Zumba, Bootcamp, and Cardio Combat, a bunch of us yelpers were ready for some Bachi action.\u000a\u000aAfter we got seated,we were getting looks and stares from the kitchen because they reconoticed who we were, and they had some not-so-great reviews, so I just gave them a "this is your chance to step it up from my last visit" kinda smile.\u000a\u000aI was hella hungry, so I ordered the following:\u000a\u000aBachi Pickles\u000a\u000aFried Chicken Appetizer\u000a\u000aBachi Fish\u000a\u000aFries with Pineapple Ketchup\u000a\u000a(I shared the chicken, pickles, and fries with everyone; I wasn't THAT hungry!)\u000a\u000aThe pickles were very good, but my favorite were the pickled garlic cloves.\u000aThe chicken was crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside.\u000aBachi Fish was absolute perfection and the ketchup was addicting!\u000a\u000aI even savd a little room for dessert because I wanted some White Chocolate Yuzu Gelato, but was sadly denied because they no longer\u000ahave it on the dessert menu....bummer.\u000a\u000aBB has definitely stepped it up since my last visit and has earned its 5th star...ALOHA!!!

VThere's a first time for everything...for the first time, we finally tried 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate. We enjoyed it so much on our first visit, we went back again a couple of days later. Aunty Norma is the one in charge of the kitchen with her son(I think), and Jocelyn runs the front, taking orders and serving guests. They are so nice and really make us feel at home always making sure our orders were up to par.\u000a\u000a So far, we've tried their Garlic Chicken, Furikake Ahi, Fried Saimin, Somen Salad\u000aBBQ Fries, and Kalua Pig and Cabbage which were all so ONOLICIOUS!!! Yes there\u000acan be a wait at times, but it is worth it. at least I know my food is made to order and not sitting in a warmer or under a heat lamp.\u000a\u000aWe will most definitely be back, especially to try their Lau Lau plate on Fridays and other ono grindz!...ALOHA!!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(279/365) "808 is GREAT!!!"

VFinally got to try  Soyo when a bunch of us met up for Tien N.'s "Last UYE"(for now)\u000a\u000aCool atmosphere, k-pop tunes blasting away, and pretty tasty food with friends makes for an awesome night! We had a Korean glutton fest going on, in which each one of us ordered an item or two(or 3 in my case, cause that's how I attack!) and we passed them around like one big Yelpy family.\u000a\u000aOur selections for the evening:\u000a\u000aAll the Banchan we could eat\u000a\u000aCrispy rice with Smelt Eggs in a Stone Pot\u000a\u000aMarbled Beef Salad\u000a\u000aCrispy Dumplings\u000a\u000aChicken Gizzards with Garlic\u000a\u000aKorean style Omelette\u000a\u000aFish Cake Soup\u000a\u000aCold Spicy Noodles\u000a\u000aPotato Pancake\u000a\u000aFried Rice Cakes with a Sweet Chili Sauce\u000a\u000aand last but not least, the famous Budae Jjigae\u000a\u000a-Overall, the food was pretty good aside from a few things:\u000athe gizzards were salty and on the tough side with hella onions, and the garlic still had a crunch to it???\u000a\u000apotato pancake was pretty bland\u000a\u000adumplings at Island Style are better.\u000a\u000aWe also passed the $75 mark which earned Tien a spin on the wheel.\u000aWhat did he win???? A bottle of Lychee Soju for our table...WOOOHOOO!!!\u000a\u000aTien and Anthony-Be safe, and we'll have some Budae Jjigae and Soju waiting for you when you both get back from duty.....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(1/365) Tien's Send Off

I got #27(no, I an't gonna butcher the name!) I also wanted to try their Kim Chee Fried Rice with Egg and wifey got the Mixed Seafood Sundubu with no spice. \u000a\u000aDidn't care for their Kim Chee Fried Rice with the egg on top which was overcooked. \u000aI'm not that big on Sundubu, but I thought it tasted pretty good. The endless banchan were delicious, and my cold noodles hit the spot. The heat had me in the sniffles, and I ended up killing a whole bottle of the Barley Tea, but I kept eating...It was that good!\u000a\u000aGood food, even greater company, that's what its all about....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  4

VBeen here twice now, and I love the atmosphere and the old school vinyl action, and the service we got from the girl with short hair who wore a hat during the Yelp Bazaar\u000awas very nice, helpful and informative in explaning their menu items to us even though we didn't purchase anything.\u000a\u000aOn this visit, it was like day and night...Ordered a Cappucino and a Mocha, both cups were totally covered with foam, and I honestly couldn't tell them apart. So I ask the barrista(more like BIATCHRISTA) which one's which?\u000a\u000aStraight-faced, she answers "the one with chocolate", and goes about her business...REALLY Mofo!?!?!?!\u000a\u000aMust've been the same snot that Raven L. recieved crappy service from.\u000aCoffee wasn't all that, and even more disappointing was the highly overrated Crap and Tickle sandwich...don't believe the hype!....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(128/365) "Totally Missed a Beat"

V*200th Review*\u000a\u000aI've had many a Chicago Dogs, But never a Peruvian Dog or Tokyo Brat, so me and my wifey paid a visit to The Lunch Box.\u000a\u000aAs you step inside, Cool artwork and vintage lunchboxes add to the laid back vibe of this place. The owner Joe, can be seen in action servin' up his Dogs or whipping up his chocolate-studded waffflewiches to order.\u000a\u000aWifey went with the Peruvian and some salt & vinegar chips, I went with a Peruvian, Tokyo Brat, and some Hawaiian Style BBQ Chips. Joe's selection of Faygo Sodas from Detroit are cool too! We both got Peach which went perfectly with our lunch(Other places that carry Faygo  are Detroit Motor City Coney Dogs on Water Street in Henderson, and on the Haulin' Balls Food Truck) \u000a\u000aThe Peruvian was good, but my favorite was the Tokyo Brat. He also had a Milwaukee Dog which I'm curious about. Well, there's always next time...\u000a\u000aAfter lunch, we decided to try one of Joe's Wafflewiches. He had Mocha Fudge, Pistachio, and Vanilla. We kept it simple and split a vanilla wafflewich.\u000aWarm, crisp exterior, soft interior, a great end to an awesome lunch!\u000aMuchos Mahalos Joe, you da Man!!!!...........ALOHA!!!

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(159/365) "Boba In My Hood"\u000a\u000aWe live so close to Tea Time Cafe, in fact, I think its the only spot in our neighborhood. On the times I have been here, it was just to get a boba drink on the way home. I have tried their Lychee, Taro, and Avocado(all powder) boba smoothies which were good and hit the spot  especially on hot days and days where we don't really feel like venturing too far out..\u000a\u000aThe service was great and the boba had a good texture. I haven't tried any of their savory bites yet, but looking at all the photos, looks like I'll be returning to give those a try. Conveniently located for those of us who live in the area, a perfect spot to beat this summer heat! ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  4

VWe paid a visit again for lunch, and already having tied both the Mochiko and Furikake bentos, I decided to try their Garlic Bento: huge pieces of garlic chicken, hot dog, spam, teriyaki beef skewers, and okinawan sweet potato tempura...This bento was SO ONO TOO! but I think my favorite is still the Mochiko Bento which we also shared, and we added a side of furikake shrimp as well.\u000a\u000aThere is a slight possibility of perhaps another one opening up  close to Slidin' Thru NW\u000a(The owner of the building has already proposed it to them) so I'll most definitely keep my fingers crossed and in the mean time, make the 45 minute trek to Jones and Robindale!....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(192/365) " Garlic, Mochiko, or Furikake????"

VMy mom wanted to pick up DVDs of cartoons and Disney stuff for my niece and nephews back home, so I knew just the place to go. We had time to kill before dinner, so we stopped in at Zia.\u000a\u000aIts good to see that these guys are still goin' strong. I miss Jelly's back home and Rasputin in the Bay Area who have similar operations as this. I love that they also have a wide selection of cool collectibles here. I stopped by their Star Wars section and saw cool Star Wars ice cube trays and picked up a sweet Boba Fett wallet since my Puma one had to go into retirement.\u000a\u000aBeing a fan of Hip Hop culture, I also picked up a couple of packs of Kid Robot's "All City Breakers" that comes with a random B-Boy(or B-Girl), boom box, and fold out cardboard-SWEET! Mom got what she needed and we were happy campers. Stop in\u000aif you've never been its always a cool time in here....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(34/100) "Mixed Media"

VFusion???? More like confusion to me...Pulled up to the stand about 1:30...the sign read "closed" What? at 1:30 in the afternoon? I walk closer to the stand and a girl opens the sliding window, so I ask "Are you closed? "No, not at all she says, with a confused look, somehow I'm still not buying it, but I drove all this way so WTH, I place my orders...ordered a beef taco, tofu and egg taco, not so french fries and a fried dough...four items ordered, I'm the only one there, and my order took OVER 15 MINUTES! Whats even fishier about this situation\u000ais he gave me the fried dough first, then the fries, then lastly, the tacos I ordered FIRST....I seriously think he was about to close for the day when I arrived because Ron didn't even take time to heat the tortillas for my tacos, they were Cool and not warm, and they had that Out-of-the-bag chewiness, not that warmth and softness you get from a properly heated tortilla. If you've eaten Thai style beef jerky, thats how tough my beef taco was. the egg and tofu were tasteless, and his version of Kimchi came up short lacking the heat and tanginess you get from a good kimchi. His not-so-french fries were not-so-impressive either, just a salty mess. the fried dough was about the only decent thing out of my whole order. Come to think of it, the whole time I waited for my order, I didn't  hear any sounds  OR smells of cooking, so out of curiousity, i pulled into another parking spot just to see if he was closing up shop, and WHADDAYA KNOW? within 5 minutes, umbrellas came down, packed it in the food cart and he was gone. Ron, I wish you had told me you were closed for the day instead of feeding me such mediocre food. Coming from a CIA(Culinary Institute of America) Graduate is even more hard to believe, because I know for a fact we weren't taught that way. Yes WE, I happen to be a CIA graduate myself.......

VOkay, we've been here three times in the past four days due to the addicting food and AWESOME service we've recieved in all  of our visits here...\u000a\u000a7/13/11-Finally brought the wifey along so she could taste the love...She got a Bulgogi Fusion Taco, a Fish Taco, and a Green Chile Tamale.\u000a\u000aI wanted to try other Items on the menu, and I saw on the Chef's Special board-Asian Fusion Chipotle Birria....SOLD!!!!! and of course, I had to get my fusion taco fix, so I ordered a Bulgogi Fusion Taco as well.(I killed 'em both ;P)\u000a\u000aEverything we had was excellent, with the exception of the tamale-Masa was a little dense and the tamale itself was under seasoned,but still, a great meal overall.....\u000a\u000a\u000a7/15/11-Found ourselves here again since they have a wide variety of items,\u000aAmerican, Mexican, and Asian aside from the fusion items....Wifey was craving a burger, so she a Cheeseburger Deluxe with fries, I went with the Torta Ahogada(Wet Mexican Sandwich) and my usual fusion taco:)\u000a\u000aThe Cheeseburger was simple and straightforward with that homemade diner\u000ataste...YUM!\u000a\u000aThe Torta Ahogada was HUGE!-Steak, Pork, and Bacon stewed in a chipotle-tomato sauce with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and avocado smothered with more sauce, meat and cheese-usually smothered with a red sauce similar to enchilada sauce, KoMex has made the Torta Ahogada their way, and it was excellent! Totally filling and worth taking a stab at  for one of their non-fusion items...No dessert items here, but the fresh orange makes for a perfect ending to our meal.\u000a\u000aAs we're taking a much needed breather, Lynda comes by and drops off a couple protein-style fusion chicken tacos for us to try. This is their new version which has a good dose of kochujang sauteed into the chicken meat...very tasty indeed!\u000a\u000aI'm also happy to hear that the power of Yelp is slowly exposing local businesses like KoMex as we overheard a couple of tables say it was their first time there and found KoMex through Yelp-SWEET!\u000a\u000aLike Connie and Wai over at Big Wong, Lynda and Sonny's priorities\u000aare with customer satisfaction and affordability, especially with the way the economy is nowadays....Thanks again Lynda and Sonny, we'll definitely be back!...ALOHA!!!

VWe paid a visit to the KoMex family again, and this time, Sonny had a Bulgogi Torta special that sounded too good to pass up. The wifey was a little sicky, so she ordered half orders of the Asian style Siete Mares soup, and Mongolian Beef(yup, they do half orders on the Asian menu items cause the portions are HUMANGOUS!!! As always, the food was delish! I also had to sample the Spam Musubi with egg which looked like a Flintstone's portion where the nori could barely hold everything together, spam was perfect, the rice was kissed with a little shoyu and sesame love, and another KoMex item worth attacking....Mahalo once again Lynda, Brittany, and Chef/Sherriff Sonny!(yup, the KoMex mascot is Sonny;)......Also, as Misti Y. requested, they're also perfecting a tofu fusion taco, and for those of you living in the Southwest area, keep your fingers crossed...expansion plans are in the works by year's end where they plan to serve just the fusion stuff...ALOHA!!!            \u000a\u000a                      YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(5/365) Better than Kogi!?!?!

VThis is not my first choice, (I'm a fan of 808 Mixed Plate, Island Style, and Island flavor) but after a long day and craving local grindz, L&L will do in a hurry as its the closest spot near us, like 5-10 minutes from home.\u000a\u000aTheir Mini Katsu Curry hits the spot ( It ain't ZEN but it'll do in a jiffy) and will hold me over until my next craving hits for some quick and cheap local grindz....ALOHA!!!

VAs far as fast food Mexican joints go, Cafe Rio is pretty good. Portions are very generous, and I like that their tortillas are made freshly throughout the day.\u000a\u000aHaven't tried other offerings yet, because we almost always go for the burritos. Skip the boring chicken and go for the Pork Barbacoa or the Chile Roasted Beef. They're both very tasty options. Also, enchilada style(AKA wet burrito) is the way to go, topped with salsa verde and cheese. Drink selections there are plentiful too.\u000a\u000aBeware of other extras and add-ons though, or you could end up with a pricey meal!\u000aIf you just HAVE TO get your sour cream, pico, or their addicting house dressing,(AKA Salsa Verde mixed with Ranch) they are big enough to share. Will probably try one of their huge salads next time if I can get myself to take a break from their burritos!....ALOHA!!!

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(167/365) "Style Elements"\u000a\u000aYou never know what you can find here.Kinda like an upscale sundries shop, you got your grab and go stuff like drinks and snacks(but you're even better off  walking right across to Jean Philippe Patisserie! ;)  but on the serious side though, you can also find cool things here.\u000a\u000aI've seen things like sweet Adidas track suits and more recently, a cool looking shirt on a mannequin. This place has a tendency to make you spend on things that you don't really need. but you get it anyway!

VSo after getting sweets from Ronald's to enjoy after dinner, we hit up Monta for some ramen action...My wife ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with egg, chashu, and corn. I ordered the Miso Ramen with egg and extra chashu. We also got a side of Gyoza and I tried the mini "Mentaiko"(Fish Eggs over rice with nori and sesame seeds\u000a\u000aThe Mentaiko was simple and good with a slight heat at the end, the gyoza was okay. Both the miso and Tonkotsu ramen were also good but\u000athese guys are pretty slick about jacking up the price of your order with the add on toppings just like some pizza joints do.\u000a\u000aMonta is pretty decent but its nothing like spots in Cali or Back home in Hawaii.....Makes me miss Shiro's and Ezogiku even more...ALOHA!!!

Washed it all down with a Strawberry Lemonade(This was AFTER we had already scarfed down a Sloppi Jo, Pork and chicken Tacos, Green Chile Chicken Stew and Sopapillas!)\u000a\u000aButa Burger was bomb, as well as the Fuku Moco with the smokiness of the shaved bonito on top, the Naga Dog had a nice char and snap to it.\u000aFurikake was a nice touch on the Mac Salad...fries were aight with their "crack sauce" which tastes like yum yum sauce you find at sushi joints...Overall, good first trip, mos def not the last....ALOHA!!!

VDon't know what it is with any business that starts to expand, but once you open other locations around town, the quality of the food suffers. \u000a\u000aPerfect example is Firefly on Sahara. The only decent items we had were the olives and tomato butter you get in the beginning, and the Bacon wrapped dates.\u000a\u000aWe ordered the other following items which were a total failure in taste and execution:\u000a\u000aCeviche-totally overkilled with lime juice and you could hardly taste the fish, and where's the salt?\u000a\u000aBoquerones- When I ordered these at the Paradise location, the bread was slightly toasted, the roasted pepper vinaigrette was full of flavor, and the Aioli was garlicky and creamy-this time, the bread wasn't even toasted, the pepper vinaigrette was barely noticeable, and the aioli was not only flavorless, but was also runny! Aioli does not run!!!\u000a\u000aMussels-Ever had mussel jerky? They do it very well here. My order was almost all shells. when I did find a mussel, it honestly was the size of a dime!(PLEASE SEE MY PICTURE!!!PLEASE!!!!) To the idiot who doesn't know how to cook mussels properly-They're done right when their shells open!!!!\u000a\u000aPulpo Asado-No charred,grilled taste whatsoever...more like stewed with peppers and sherry vinegar....wtf?????\u000a\u000aFirefly Fries- we got these free because the table next to us that did order them already had their order. Cool! Right? WRONG!\u000adrenched in that same tasteless aioli-YUCK!\u000a\u000aSo our waiter suggests the Chocolate Tres Leches and the Banana-Nutella Sandwiches......sandwiches were forgettable and the tres leches was a total mushy mess! You're better off going to Mariana's or Cardenas and getting the real deal Holyfield Tres Leches at a fraction of the cost.\u000a\u000aWhy all the 4 and 5 star reviews?????Like Flava Flav says, \u000a"Don't believe the hype!!!!"....ALOHA!!!!!

VAnother place for cheap eats after 10pm..Reverse Happy Hour here means ask for the lunch menu and all the items listed are no higher than $7.50! It's also good to go with someone who can speak Chinese (Tony T.) You always get better service.\u000a\u000aWe started off with some Hot and Sour Soup and followed with Salt and Pepper Shrimp, Hong Kong Style Pan Fried Noodles, Beef Chow Fun, and Pork Spareribs.\u000aOur party of five devoured everything in no time, thanks to the workout session at Shine Alternative fitness a few hours earlier. Each dish had its own distinct flavor and was very delicious!\u000a\u000a All the plates were empty, but all that was left on our lazy susan was a pot of about 750 to 1000 grains of rice which would be very shameful to waste, so we decided to order an Eggplant Hot Pot with salted fish which was also delicious, and we cleaned up leaving no survivors behind.\u000a\u000aTotal damage? $40.....a great choice for cheap late night eats, and if you're in Chinatown deciding where you wanna get your grub on....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(215/365) "Lunch Specials After 10pm"

VSo after reading Jill C.'s ROTD on Indian Curry Bowl, I thought I'd take a drive down, since its minutes away from our house.\u000a\u000aI get to the front door and find that  they're CLOSED!?!?!?! AHHHHHHH!\u000a(Indian Curry Bowls hours are from 11am-9pm, but they close down from 2:30-4pm and open up again for dinner). Bummin' because I wanted to get my Curry on, I look across the way and see that Smashburger has finally opened their Centennial Center branch, so WTH, I went there to feast on my first Smashburger.\u000a\u000aI ordered the 1/3 pound Sin City Smashburger with fried egg, applewood smoked bacon, american cheese grilled onions, haystack onions, and smash sauce which tasted like a blend of mayo and mustard "smashed" together on an egg bun. I also ordered their sweet potato smashfries(pretty skimpy on the portions) which are tossed with olive oil, rosemary, and garlic, and a frosty mug of IBC root beer.\u000a\u000aSmashburger also offers salads, hot dogs, smashchicken burgers and Haagen-Dazs shakes and malts if you happen to be in the mood.\u000aI don't know if they're trying to be a little more "gourmet upscale", but it seems like they're trying to take Hubert Keller's Burger Bar Concept and trying to make it affordable to the masses. I think for what they give, its pretty pricey, and then they get you on the add-ons.\u000a\u000aI could have gotten two #1s at In-n-Out across the street for what I got at Smashburger, and its funny that on the table next to me of 3 people, one guy ordered Smashburger and two of his buddies were eating In-n-Out combosLOL!!! Next time, In my opinion, If I want fast food, I'll stick to In-n-Out, If I want high end, I'll gladly pay $6 for a little pitcher of Hubert Kellers Black Truffle Sauce to pour on each bite of my custom burger at Burger Bar.....ALOHA!!!

V***************************************500th Review***************************************\u000a\u000aReview number 500 goes to  my present "home away from home"..... The Entertainment Capital of the World, Sin City, 9th Island, call it what you want, but Las Vegas has been good to me. Almost 8 years ago, I left Wine Country after living there 9 years for a job opportunity with one of the world's top Pastry Chefs. Where else would you get an hour long paid break with a hot meal and  perks within the company? To this day, I'm doing what I enjoy, and still with the same people, so job wise, Las Vegas has been good to me.\u000a\u000aThe cost of living here has also been a plus. We have been able to purchase a home without drowning in finances. Our mortgage is less than what some people pay for rent, and we can still save up for a rainy day. No State tax??? HELLS YEAH! Financially,  Las Vegas has been good to me.\u000a\u000aAfter a near-death experience in Wine Country where a man's life was taken in front of me, and mine was spared, I could only realize that it wasn't my time to go, and that the big man upstairs had other plans for me. I really needed to re-evaluate my priorities in life, and FAST! We relocated to "Sin City" of all places, and who would've thought we would find an awesome place to worship on The Sabbath, also a day off that is VERY difficult to get in my profession, in Las Vegas??? I tell you, the power of prayer and trusting in The Lord works wonders, and I feel totally blessed and my faith is strengthened with each day of life I am given...Las Vegas and The Lord has been good to me.\u000a\u000aDolce, our "Lil Chewbacca" has been another blessing in disguise. Never have we thought that we were ever gonna add a dog to our household, and we would visit the puppy store(and Vegas has ALOT of them!) numerous times, BUT....it was that one day that we decided to stop in and wifey was looking for a doggy bag for her sister's dog, that I went over to to check out the puppies, and I saw this liitle fluff ball sitting in his kennel, well behaved and staring off into space while all the other puppies were yapping away. "Honey, you gotta take a look at this one!" I said as she came toward the window. Just the type she has ALWAYS wanted, a Pomeranian with a beautiful cream coat. We took him to the playpen and after wifey looked eye-to-eye with him for a good, long 10 seconds, he licked her nose with his little tongue and that was all it took.\u000aA lady was eager for us to put him back and she was PISSED when that didn't happen. Got things situated with an employee, looked her way, and I obviously said "Yup, he's coming home with us" and I gave her a big "How you like them apples?" kinda smile...We named him after Dolce, a Napa Valley wine, NOT the fashion designer!\u000a\u000aThere are LOTS of perks as a resident in Vegas as well The people and diverse cultures that are in Las Vegas are also something I love about living here...Hiking, trips to nearby states, discounts at the clubs and shows on the strip, no fleas for Dolce, no allergies for me(I would sufffer BIG TIME living in Wine Country) festivals, concerts, fairs, alot of movie theaters all around town, tons of sporting events and THE FOOD! We are totally spoiled with tons of choices here! You got your choice of Celebrity Chef establishments, Local eateries, a gang of buffet choices, ethnic eats, and even the streets, if you ain't scurred...you will never go hungry here because there is always something open, and Las Vegas (to me) is just a big circle, so I don't really mind driving across town for something. Its not as far as people make it out to be...\u000a\u000aLast, but certainly not least, YELP LAS VEGAS!!!! Because of Yelp, our kick-ass CM Misti, and her associates  Bobby Y., Terri K., Bentern, and J-Tern we've experienced a little bit of the "Rockstar Lifestyle" being HELLA spoiled at Elite events, seen a few shows, kicked it VIP style at the club, dined at great establishments, and forming great friendships along the way. And to this day, there are tons more to do and see in this great city, and many more things to  discover! Overall, The City of Las Vegas has totally been good to me, and for those of you who constantly hate on Las Vegas, caught up in the drama, temptation, and sinful side and don't like it here, Las Vegas didn't put a gun to your head, you're where you're at by YOUR OWN ACTIONS!!! With every action, there is a reaction. Positive or Negative? The choice is yours....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(280/365) "What Happens in Vegas Ends Up On Yelp!"

VStepping out of Vanguard on our way home, I was kinda hungry , so I grabbed a hot dog from Cheffini's. For $3, you can custom build your dog, so I asked for everything but the Jalapenos.I liked the sweetness of the pineapple with the salty crunch of the crushed potato chips...Definitely hit the spot...ALOHA!!!

VGreat concept, Tasty tacos, and definitely coming back!\u000a\u000aWe tried pretty much every taco they offered except the Tripas(intestine)Sesos(Beef Brain), Cabeza(Beef Head) and Buche(Pork Stomach)because we were too full!\u000aThe Asada, Chorizo, Suadero, and Adobada/Al Pastor were all very good\u000aas was the Azteca(Asada topped with Grilled Nopales(Cactus)which has a taste crossing between grilled bell pepper and the slight sliminess of okra.\u000a\u000aNice people, great service, great TJ style tacos. For those of you yelpers who only stick to the safe choices(asada and al pastor), live a little and tap into your inner Andrew Zimmern and give the lengua, tripas and the other iess desirable parts a try, you know what they say, "Don't knock it 'til you try it"....ALOHA!!!!

VThe owners at Che Inka have been running this place for about three and a half months now, and have added an argentinean menu to the already existing peruvian menu, so you have the best of both cultures.\u000a\u000aWe met Sylvana and her husband(didn't get his name) and instantly, they made us feel right at home and had us start off with some warm bread and Chimichurri. Wanting to try their chicken because they advertise themselves as a chicken grill, they suggested we try their  Saltado Mixto (Peruvian style fajitas). We also got an order of their Ceviche as well as an order of the Papa a la  Huanciana (Potatoes with a creamy"aji" sauce made with cheese and chilis)\u000a\u000atheir drinks are great as well. Sylvia got a passionfruit(Maracuya) drink and I got an Inca Kola(a golden cola from Peru that tastes like a cross between banana and bubble gum)\u000a\u000athe ceviche was very refreshing and paired with the toasted corn, sweet potato, and corn on the cob made a delicious combination.\u000a\u000aThe potatoes had a homey taste and feel to them. simple, tasty, and had a kick  to them.\u000a\u000aThe Saltado Mixto(Chicken and Beef Fajitas) was good but nothing memorable. It was similar to the Lomo Saltado we ate at Little Dumplings on Eastern.\u000a\u000aFeeling stuffed, we deciided to try their Pasta Flora, a traditional Quince Pie for dessert. It was good, but the quince was a little too sweet for me. All in all, a good time, and we'll be back to try items on their Argentinean menu as well as their famous Peruvian rotisserie chicken. Sylvana and her husband are very hospitable and also let us in on future happenings at the restaurant. They will be having Parilladas(Just like a churrasceria) at $30 a person for all you carnivores out there on special days throughout each month(send them your e-mail to recieve details) and they will also feature latin rock nights.\u000a\u000aDon't forget to take a box of Alfajores (cookies sandwiched with dulce de leche) home....ALOHA!!!

VSmarty's is the home for the sole surviving Thrifty's ice cream stand after Rite-Aid in Vegas went out of business. All of their unique flavors are available, and definitely is worth the price you pay for.

VThis store has got everything for everyone who wants to get their drink on.\u000a\u000aPrices are  pretty good, and I'm usually in the beer and wine sections. On this visit, I picked up some Estrella Damm Inedit Beer from Spain which was created by Chef Ferran Adria and his associates.\u000a\u000aLight and easy drinking, this beer has citrus and spice notes and is meant to be served with seafood.(This is also served with the lobster course at e` by Jose` Andres)\u000aIt was definitely a hit at the Beer BQ we had this past weekend!...Get Some!

VDecided to switch it up and have Taiwanese breakfast since its been a while...The sweet soy milk with chinese doughnuts were good, as were the little pastries(sweet and savory) we tried-ham and radish, shanghai onion, and curry pies, and two types of sweet pastries, one baked and one fried which tasted okay. The pancake omelet was a liitle over done this time, as was the Salted Rice Roll with the shreddded dried pork...ALOHA!!!

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(97/365) "Where My Dogs At !?!?"\u000a\u000aA bunch of us decided to take our pooches out for the day and meet up at Mix 94.1's\u000aPet-A-Palooza. Although its called PET a-Palooza, It was a dog day afternoon. I did see someone with a python though! Oh, and cats...The HUGE cats from Lion Habitat!\u000a\u000aDogs of all breeds, shapes, sizes and colors roamed the grounds of Sunset Park\u000astopping by various dog vendors, animal rescue organizations, and even a cooling station.The dog owners also had access to food, drinks, and even musical entertainment.\u000a\u000aDolce is ALWAYS a big hit at these types of events, people just have to pet the Boo Look-a-like(as many people mentioned) and take pictures as well. Fellow Pomeranian owners and even Mrs. Las Vegas and Miss California also took pix with Dolce and their Poms as well, and we even did a little interview with UNLV TV. It was a great time with pooches and pals...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  3

VWe drove here after our NYE feast at Yummy Grill to ring in the new year, so we didn't really get to experience Born and Raised to the fullest extent.\u000a\u000aFrom what I could see, there were alot of TV screens along the walls televising games of all kinds and that this was an obvious UNLV Rebels/great locals hangout. We had a glass of sparkling wine to toast with when it hit midnight and caught a glimpse of the fireworks from afar.\u000a\u000aWe accidentally had our glasses in hand(OOOOOPSY!) and no glassware was allowed outside the building, so we hurried back in to hang out for a little while longer before calling it an awesome evening out with fantablous friends. From reading other reviews, the food options sound pretty good, so maybe we will revisit Born and Raised when we're in these neck of the woods.

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(154/365) "Duck, Duck, Goose...I Mean Pork Belly!"\u000a\u000aBetter late than never,right? After an afternoon of ingredient shopping for Panang Curry across the street at 168 Market, I was tired, hot, and hungry. Rather than just grab something at the 168 Deli, I wanted to try a different spot.\u000a\u000aI pulled up the Yelp App on my phone and Asian BBQ was one of the choices and was just across the street. I've never been there, and heard nothing but good things from Yelpers. I saw the first picture and looked no further. I said to myself "Self, that's what I want, and that's what I'm gonna get!"\u000a\u000aIt looks like nothing from the outside but when you enter, this place is packed with people getting their grub on. Right away, I order the 2 choice BBQ Plate Special ($7.99) of their Roast Duck and Roast Pork. As I peruse the menu, I see Hainan Chicken, and I contemplate on getting a third choice($10.99) The lady taking my order starts giggling because she can see my "eyes getting bigger than my stomach" look, and at the same time, I hear R. Kelly...R. KELLY!?!? Yes, R.Kelly, and he's singing (as in the Bump and Grind intro) "Your mind's telling you NOOOOOO.......But your stomach, your stomach's telling you YESSSSSSSS!"(Its a BIG sign of hunger when you start hearing things!) I block it all out and stick to my order, and I'm so glad I did because their take out portions are HUMANGOUS!\u000a\u000aI get in my car, and it smells SO GOOD, I gotta just have one bite...which turned into another bite, and another one,  and another one! I finally pulled myself together,  turned up the A/C and headed home.  The duck was very juicy and that liquid Elixir of duck love that they pour over the duck and rice is pretty bomb. The pork was crispy with just enough fat and tasty meat too. I ate half the plate for lunch and the rest for dinner.\u000a\u000aCan't wait to come back and try their noodle selections which they also have many choices for! Fast, cheap, and delicious, seriously one of the best deals in town.   ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  5\u000a\u000aCASH ONLY and closed on Fridays FYI....

VThe Guys at 9091 know how to dish up Korean fusion grub. We stopped by one night because I was curious to try the BBQ Beef and Spicy Chicken Tacos. They also Suggested the Bullgogi Burger and Bibop Burrito Specials...After a long 5 seconds, I said  "Cool, we'll try 'em all"\u000a\u000aThe Tacos were really tasty with just enough spice and tons of greenery,\u000athe Bibop Burrito was Bibimbap goodness wrapped in a flour tortilla, and that half-pound Bullgogi Burger did not dissappoint!\u000a\u000aBUT......\u000a\u000adidn't really care for their"sweet potato fries" cold, not crispy, and tasted like they sweeten it up with something funky...ALOHA!!!

My favorite food stand was the 9th Isle food stand's Smoked Meat(Pipikaula)...Malasadas were nothing but fried Pilsbury Biscuits.\u000a\u000aWe also had a blast at the Kapena concert which was awesome from start to finish! Definitely not missing next year....ALOHA!!!

VGreat outdoor venue, and a plus that You don't have to go through a casino. Parking is pretty spacious and the seating is pretty standard, but you also have an option to sit on the lawn area, which is very far from the stage.\u000a\u000aWe came here for The Rock and Worship Roadshow which was a great concert featuring various Chistian music artists. The sound system was pretty good, but as other reviews stated, security seemed lax as compared to other concert venues.\u000a\u000aThere are food vendors there, but we were smart enough to have lunch at Rice Trax (yet again!) and their bentos were good enough to hold us over for dinner(you guessed it, Goyemon, yet again!) If you like filling up on hot dogs, popcorn, and nachos, go ahead, knock yourself out...\u000a\u000aCoolers, lawn chairs, and outside food not allowed in the venue...you have been warned...ALOHA!!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(186/365) "The Pavillion in Hendertucky"

VHaven't seen Marianne or Roxanne since my UYE at Sin City Sushi a few months ago, It is because thet have been hella busy servin' up THE BEST AND ONLY SHAVE ICE IN TOWN!\u000a\u000aComing from the island of Waiola, Matsumotos, and Island Snow, SnOw OnO tastes just like home! After lunch at Mint and some fun at The Pinball Hall of Fame, We finally tracked SnOw OnO down on Lake Mead next to that stand that serves so-called Korean style tacos.\u000a\u000aOver 30 flavors to choose from with sweet toppings and add-ons,Wifey got cola, lime, and POG(Passion-Orange-Guava) with ice cream and a snow cap. I kept it simplemand got Banana with ice cream and a snow cap. It was SOOOOO good, that I even forgot to take a picture of my shave ice!\u000a\u000aThanks again SnOw OnO for bringing a little of home to Las Vegas. Oh yeah, Congrats Marianne on your little"bun in the oven"....,ALOHA!!!

VHad some SnOw OnO again for dessert at the Ellis Island Hatch Chile Roast, and this time, I decided to be adventurous and go for their special event flavors-Mango Hatch Chile and Cherry Hatch Chile.\u000a\u000aMarianne and Roxanne weren't there(She's due VERY SOON!) but Marianne's husband was holding it down in the SnOw OnO bus with a few new faces.\u000a\u000aBack to the Shave Ice, The mango reminded me of the mango candy coated with chile powder you find in the latin markets, and the cherry barely tasted like cherry, but the chile snuck up from behind and warmed up my lips. The texture of the chile made it kinda difficult to really permeate the shave ice like their other flavored syrups do, but no worries, I enjoyed a root beer slush after I ate the syrup covered parts...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE(17/365) "Hawaiian Shave Ice"

VYes folks, it's Snow Ono Season!\u000a\u000aWe were at the Gourmet Food truck Block party and ready for dessert. Coolhaus was there, but their sandwiches were looking pretty much like ass, so we skipped it and went to visit Marianne and her crew.\u000a\u000aIt was hella scorching, so it called for a large shave Ice. I had always wondered what Tiger's Blood was, and when one of the workers mentioned that it was a blend of Strawberry, Watermelon, and Coconut, I was sold! Now this is my new favorite flavor, and I always get it with a snow cap and popping boba, cause that's how I do shave ice.\u000a\u000aMarianne also told me she was working on a halo-halo concoction after she read what I mentioned in a recent talk thread which got me all excited, BUT Marianne, two things-\u000aI wanna be the first in line to taste your halo-halo creation, and second, I'll take a super big gulp sized cup because the large won't be enough!....j/k...;0\u000a\u000aBut for reals, Snow Ono kicks the S@#T out of places back home, not even Waiola comes close! Yup, I said it....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(285/365) " Best Shave Ice- Period..."

VThank goodness Snow Ono was there to cool us off during First Friday. There was a new bunch crankin' out the shave ice and I was told Marianne is more behind the scenes now, and makes a cameo appearance every once in a while.(Good for you Marianne!)\u000a\u000aAs always, I go big, and I go with a Tiger's Blood with the Snow Cap and Popping Boba cause that combo is DA WINNAH! (Try it, you'll see what I'm talkin' 'bout!!!) Softest, smoothest ice EVER!!!\u000a\u000aI said it before, and I'll say it again- I grew up eating shave ice all over Hawaii(Matsumoto's Shimazu's Baldwin's, Aoki's, Island Snow and even Waiola-BOTH locations(considered the best in Hawaii by MANY) They ain't got nothing on Snow Ono!....and that's the fact JACK!!!...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000a,

VStopped in after hearing all the raves regarding the red velvet pancakes and the kalua pig benedict....Noticed a few local hawaiian and filipino dishes-portuguese sausage, loco moco, spam, adobo fried rice omelette and kalua pig!? for breakfast???\u000a\u000aSo I ask my waitress if the owner was from Hawaii...."No, she's not from Hawaii, she's just been there a few times" Uh-oh.............I take my chances anyway and go with the benedict and forego the potatoes and pay a little extra for a side of the red velvet pancakes.\u000a\u000aBreakfast is my favorite meal of the day and an egg is really hard to screw up, but these cooks did a great job at that. I felt like I was cutting into an egg mc muffin because the yolk wasn't oozing like it should have if you know how to poach an egg. Hollandaise looked and tasted instant and I know wasn't made fresh. And how are you gonna have carnitas pass as kalua pig? same meat, different preparations....definitely lacking saltinesss and smokiness you get from properly made kalua pig....definitely failed on execution here.\u000a\u000aRed Velvet Pancakes were good and I'll just stick to the non-local items if there is a return visit. Some may disagree on my 3-star rating, but being a stickler for \u000agood food DONE RIGHT, I call it like I taste and see it and I'm sticking to my guns......BANG BANG!!!!.......................................................ALOHA!!!

VLulu's was also at The Ellis Island Hatch Chile Roast and I decided to order two items on their chile inspired menu:\u000a\u000a-Fried Rice Balls(Arancini) -hatch chiles, oven roasted tomatoes, grass fed beef, and romano cheese\u000a\u000a-English Muffin Sandwich-Italian pork, caramelized hatch chiles, italian salami, gouda, provolone, topped with a fried egg\u000a\u000aThe Rice balls came up first, and as I was waiting for the muffin sandwich, I noticed a green apple soda they had and I was gonna try it, but I declined, knowing that Ellis Island had complimentary drinks for us Yelp VIPs....I ordered 2 items, which magically became 4...as my sandwich was ready for pick up, I also see some chocolate chip cookies,\u000aand Chris says-"Hey Nelson, grab one of those green sodas out front, on me."  It's great to know people in the food biz :)\u000a\u000aThe rice balls were crisp on the outside with a creaminess and a nice heat on the inside with just the right amount of meat and sauce...The muffin sandwich was also a winner with the saltiness of the pork and salami, mild heat from the chiles, and the cheeses and yolk oozing with each bite...as Borat would say, "GREAT SUCCESS!"  The green apple soda tasted exactly like Jolly Rancher candy and the cookies were warm, soft, and chewy....perfect way to end my meal from Lulu's.\u000a\u000aThanks again to Chris and the rest of team Lulu's, you guys are definitely raising the bar on Las Vegas'  food truck scene...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(18/365) "Top Trucks"

VStopped in after a downhill dining experience at EN. There were alot of 5-star reviews for this place so we thought this place must be awesome!\u000a\u000aI tried the Strawberrry Sensation and wifey got the Rebel Special....\u000a\u000aWhile waiting for our order, the crowd kept getting bigger and the three people making everyone's orders  seemed to get kinda nervous, probably because the crepes and waffles weren't coming out as fast as people were coming in...here's why:\u000a\u000a-one person was cooking the crepe\u000a\u000a-one person was assembling the crepe\u000a\u000a-one person was waiting with a scoop of ice cream to finish the crepe\u000a\u000aWe finally got our orders, and the verdict??? Great concept, but tastewise\u000ajust okay. I guess I'm a purist when it comes to crepes being that I've crepe'd well over a hundred times, including the crepe joint in Japantown SF....It was a little too thick for my liking and the vanilla extract was pretty strong.\u000a\u000aExecution could use some refining as well...three people should be able to knock out three orders, just like the homeboys at Pier 39 in San Francisco do with  style and finesse, especially if there are more people are coming in, and also now that there's some crepe competition nearby...ALOHA!!!

VDriving down West Charleston, I see one of those human "sign holders" waving a sign saying FRENCH BAKERY PASTRY BISTRO....I turn right, go\u000apast Flemming's and I arrive at Summerlin's first local pastry shop, Patisserie Manon(Named after their first-born daughter)\u000a\u000aChef/Owners Rachel and Jean-Paul Ladeyn have run two other successful locations(same name) in Tahiti and Moorea, French Polynesia before relocating to Nevada to open the Summerlin and Boulder City locations.\u000a\u000aKelly and Amanda(Hope I memorized/spelled your names right!) were so nice and hospitable while I was in "Yelp" mode browsing the patisserie and snapping away with my camera to provide visuals for this review.\u000a"Are you a Yelper?" Kelly asks."Yes I am, It's time to promote another local business." I replied.\u000a\u000aAs you step inside, the sights and smells awaken your appetite...French pastries, artisan breads and assorted vienoiserie(danish, croissants), an open production area where "all the magic happens", a wall of assorted candies and truffles, and towards the back of the patisserie, all the savory bistro fare are displayed- savory pastries, sandwiches,  ham and cheese croissants, various types of quiche and pate, and today's specials, Lamb Ragout and Cassoulet. Unfortunately at this time,being open for just over 7 weeks, they are only doing take-out, and are waiting for permits for the addition of tables and chairs, so patrons may enjoy dining in.\u000a\u000aSo I finally settlle for a savory item as well as a sweet item- I tried a Ham and Spinach Quiche, pretty rich and flavorful, and baked in either a puff pastry or filo dough crust and a Tart Tropizienne, a pastry consisting of Brioche\u000awith vanilla cream and peaches snadwiched in between which also tasted good and something different from what I usually see at work.\u000a"Do you like Cassoulet?(a hearty pork and white bean stew)" Kelly asked?\u000a"Oh yeah, that's perfect for weather like this." I said. She was nice enough to "hook it up'" along with peanut butter and raspberry macaroons, and sent me on my way. Overall, a great first visit and I'll definitely be back. \u000a\u000aWelcome to Nevada Rachel and Jean-Paul, and Thanks again Kelly and Amanda for your hospitality.....ALOHA!!!

VStopped in again to show the wifey, and to grab a bite to eat. It was great to see different items in the pastry showcase as well as the savory side too.\u000a(they have foie gras for the Holidays!!!!!)\u000a\u000aI even got to see the chef/owners Jean-Paul and Rachel Ladeyn in action. Rachel was finishing loading up the showcase with mini Buche de Noel(French Yule Logs) and Jean Paul was finishing a beautiful *Pithivier hot out of the oven for a special order from a customer.\u000a(*Pithivier, pronounced Pee-tee-vee-ay, is a classic French pastry made of flaky puff pastry filled with frangipane(almond paste filling).\u000a\u000aIt was cool to chat with Jean-Paul and listen to him explain the significance\u000aof the Pithivier during the holidays. It is almost like the Kings Cake where everyone at the dinner table gets a piece of the Pithivier and eats it, and whoever finds that little toy or charm that was secretly baked inside gets to be "king for a day".\u000a\u000aStill waiting for clearance for another inspection, they are still only doing take out at this time, so we decided to split a Ham and Cheese Croissant,\u000aand the wifey loves meringues, so she got an orange and coconut meringue, one of their hot entrees of the day was Beef Bourguignon, so she got an order to have for lunch. I tried a pithivier, and the feuillette-a pastry with praline crisp, almond cake, and chocolate mousse, topped with crushed cigarette wafer cookies-YUM!\u000a\u000aAnother great visit, and hopefully we'll be able to dine in when we return...ALOHA!!!

VWe decided to stop here for brunch and they finally have tables and chairs so you're able to dine in or outside. Wifey got a veggie quiche and a french onion soup which was pretty good. I ordered a ham and cheese croissant and a split pea soup. My croissant was good and the split pea was a tad bit underseasoned. Overall, a decent meal and didn't break the bank either....On our way out, we got a flan....and a paris brest....and a tart tropizienne.....and a  chocolate eclair....how can you resist when all the sweets are staring you down when you walk by them????....ALOHA!!!!                      \u000a\u000a YELP 365 CHALLENGE(6/365) Vive le France!

VWe were in the area and decided to have dessert here since we haven't been back for quite some time.\u000a\u000aWe shared a Tart Tropizienne and a few Salted Caramel Macarons and they were just as good as we remember! One not-so-good thing though was the lady behind the counter huffing and puffing like she didn't want to be there, saying things under her breath as she was getting people's pastry orders, and at the same time her hair was outta whack and not even restrained whatsoever.\u000a\u000aThe people working over on the bistro side wore hats while handling food...where's yours? You are handling food, and every time you peek into the pastry case, you risk having one of your hairs falling on to the sweet treats. Hopefully that changes very soon so no one complains about a nasty hair in their food....ALOHA!!!

VETHNIC BAKERY TOUR  #2-FRANCE\u000a\u000aI have been a big fan of Rachel and Jean-Paul since day 1....(one of the first 5 Yelp reviews, only three workers plus the owners, and I remember the bistro area still under construction!) Fast forward a  few years later, and they've become a favorite local hotspot, and the staff has been beefed up, especially for the mornings. \u000a\u000aOriginally, our plan was to grab our usual favorites-Tart Tropizienne and Salted Caramel Macarons, but as I made my way toward the Bistro section, we decided to stay for a bite to eat. I spied some Escargot and also a nice slab of Foie Gras, but it was a little too early in the morning, so that's another excuse to return. We shared a small Hachis Parmentier, which is Manon's version of Shepard's Pie, a Croque Madame, and a cup of Zucchini-Cream Cheese Soup as suggested by our waiter.\u000a\u000a Sounded like a wierd combination, but the soup was actually quite good.\u000aThe Parmentier was also very well seasoned and flavorful without being very greasy, but our favorite was the Croque Madame. Just enough ham, cheese, and bechamel between each layer of crusty batard slices, one of many types of breads baked daily by Jean-Paul and not out of a bag, top that bad boy, or shall I say girl(with the addition of the egg, this dish becomes feminine....no comment....ask the French!) with an egg and you got yourself a French style breakfast of champions!\u000a\u000aOn our way out, we grabbed some Salted Caramel Macarons, and a nice crusty baguette to enjoy at home with some queso and vino....ALOHA!!!

VWe haven't been in this area since my disaster of an experience a few doors down(Refer to my Xtreme Sushi review) but with all the high ratings, I knew we'd make it here one day.\u000a\u000aYes, it is clear across town, yes, we're up by Mt. Charleston, Yes, I am that person who'll drive AAAAAAALL the way to Hendertucky for the best Snow Ice in town, and Yes, there are too many whiner vaginers who make a big deal because of the distance travelling farther than outside of their hood....two answers for you-1) Stay home, or\u000a2) Make like Rhianna and SHUT UP AND DRIVE!!!!\u000a\u000aBreakfast/Brunch is my absolute favorite meal of the day, and we're always looking for another spot to add into our breakfast/brunch rotation. I like the quirky atmosphere here. Everyone is so welcoming as you walk in, spinning umbrellas up on the ceiling, waitresses in pajamas like they just rolled out of bed ready to serve you. Puts a smile on your face..:) One weird thing was the "Help us...Yelp us" on the back of the busboys' shirts. Don't know if that's against Yelp policy, but its not like they need to do that....They have a great fan base, and great food!\u000a\u000aMenu selections here are plentiful, and our waitress Riley was AWESOME SAUCE! She was very informative, personable, and offered up suggestions, popular items, and even her personal favorites. when we narrowed it down, we split the Fried Chicken Breast and Waffles and The Ultimate Steak and Eggs Plate, with the potted bread(Took a page from Jamms?) as our bread choice, with some fresh squeezed OJ(they use Navel, not Valencia) Two HUGE chicken breasteses were fried to perfection-crisp, well seasoned exterior, and the inside stayed nice and juicy and went perfectly with the crisp, light waffle drizzled with the cinnamon infused syrup, which was unfortunately Log Cabin. The ribeye was a perfect medium rare as requested, and the hash browns were not your typical out of the box type and you can tell it was made in house. Nice and crisp on the outside, soft and creamy on the inside. As popular as they are, the potted bread didn't arrive until after we were done with breakfast. No one's fault though, as Riley even offered another bread choice, we chose to wait. Its kinda like a little Cinnabon in a flower pot that comes with a cream cheese glaze on the side and was a great ending to our meal.\u000a\u000aDefinitely can't wait to come back to attack their Sweet Cream Pancakes, Chilaquiles, and other popular items.   ALOHA!!!

VI read about Artisinal Foods in Las Vegas Luxury magazine a while back and we finally stopped in because I've been wanting to make Paella Negra and Escargot for the longest time.\u000a\u000aThe Guys that run the store are very personable and knowledgeable about all of their items from the source, to the history, and sometimes even a personal note behind an item. Unfortunately for me, they didn't have Sepia(Squid Ink) or Escargot, but they were working on getting some in.\u000a\u000aSo we just browsed around the store to see what else they had, and boy do they have some HIGH END items!\u000a\u000aTruffles, Truffle Oil, Truffle Butter, Sonoma Foie Gras, high end Oils, Vinegars, Teas and Spices, the list goes on and on...Australian Octopus and Tiger Prawns, Serrano Ham, and other cured items from Italy and Spain. They even had a couple of Items that e' by Jose Andres serves up-La Sirena Cheese, and the King of Pork, Iberico de Bellota!\u000a\u000aThey also carry the El Bulli line of Molecular Gastronomy items from the Adria Brothers\u000aand even odd items such as "Royal Jelly", something that only comes from queen bees, and Huitlacoche, a prized corn fungus. Get your sweet tooth fix from the artisan chocolates, honey , and preserves they carry as well....definitely my kind of shop!...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(117/365) "XXX Food Porn"

VVisited my "Candy Store" to get some saffron, a key ingredient(and the most expensive spice in the world!) in paella since the batch that  I had were pretty much expired and lost their potency. Artisinal Foods carries the real deal straight from Spain, and I popped ONE of those threads in my mouth and WOW! it was so potent that I still had the saffron taste in my mouth after making a couple of  stops and the drive home. Good sign!\u000a\u000aPicked up some seafood and a kick-ass bottle of beer(Estrella Damm Inedit), and I could finally execute my favorite, Paella Negra, which you won't find here in Vegas. I'm so happy that these top quality ingredients are readily available, and I don't have to wait to go back to San Francisco to enjoy this dish, I can make it in the comfort of my own home.....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(219/365) "Squid Ink Paella"

VOn this visit, I was looking to stock up on my Sepia supply, but they were out...:(\u000a\u000aTheir stock of Iberico de Bellota has seemed to disappear, but has been restocked by Wagyu Tenderloins and Ribeyes. For those of you who live in nearby Cali and really miss having some Foie action, Sonoma Foie Gras is available for $40/a pound. They will pack perishables nicely so it survives the drive home!)\u000a\u000aOther cool items I seen were fresh wasabi root from Japan, Moulard Duck Breasts and Legs which are perfect for Duck Confit, and the best Saffron from La Mancha, Spain which I picked up for an upcoming paella feast.\u000a\u000aIf you love high end food items without the high end prices, shop here...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(18/100) " The Most Expensive Spice"

VYet another update from my favorite candy store...I love coming here whenever we are in the area, its like a treasure hunt of good quality high-end food items with a great price point you cannot get anywhere in town. \u000a\u000aThe last time Brett had an in-store tasting, we weren't able to make it because we were in Hawaii at the time. This time, we weren't missing out on this one because it was showcasing products from Fermin, America's first Spanish Iberico importer.\u000aWhat is Iberico you may ask?\u000a\u000aIt is commionly known as Pata Negra, or Black Hoof. The Iberico is a descendant of the wild boar which once roamed the Mediterranean forests. It is the last free ranging/grazing pig in Europe in which the Iberico's presence plays a very crucial part of the ecosystem of the oak and cork forests of Western Spain.\u000a\u000aFor those of you who have dined at e' by Jose Andres and had the Secreto de Iberico course, you have tasted Fermin's product as Jose Andres not only uses their products, he is a part of the company as well. It was also great to  meet Raul Martin and listen to him talk about the company his grandfather Fermin Martin started in 1956 and any questions we may have on the Fermin products we tasted. Coincidentally, Fermin was Wifey's uncle's name AND my grandfather's name too! We all thought that was pretty cool...\u000a\u000aWe got to try a variety of Fermin products:\u000a\u000a PANCETTA with Water Chestnuts-Sweet, smokey, and addicting!\u000a\u000aCHORIZO-THE best chorizo I've had, nicely seasoned with the burst of pimenton\u000a\u000aSALCHICHON-similar to the chorizo without the pimenton\u000a\u000aLOMO-Loin of the Iberico, nice and meaty\u000a\u000aand of course, JAMON IBERICO, the BEST in the world! Man, this stuff just Melted in your mouth, and not even ANY prosciutto comes close!  Raul was saying you could easily get $30 for 3-4 slices of the cured meats mentioned above, and he also said not to be shy...ummm, okay! I put away a good amount of lberico goodness that evening! Its awesome to know that you can get these items here at Artisinal Foods.\u000a\u000a Brett was even nice enough to cook up some SECRETO DE IBERICO, it was as if we were dining at e' again...SO GOOD!!! 13 different cheeses, an Arugula-Brussels Sprout Salad, more cured meats, Olive Oil  Cured anchovies, and even Saffron Vanilla Snickerdoodles completed the spread!\u000a\u000aWe purchased some killer Montamore Cheese and some Iberico Pancetta and we were on our way. I can't wait until the next in-store tasting!   ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE-(68/100) "The Black Footed Pig That Eats Acorns"

VAnother email invite brought us back to my "Candy Store"... This time, Brett was hosting an artisanal roast showcasing Eric Alegria from Napa Valley who provides the finest rabbits and Heritage Pigs for some of the countries top restaurants, including The French Laundry.\u000a\u000aThe smells of a backyard barbecue being cooked up by Christian Dolias and the team at Cut Throat Culinary filled the air as things like pork loin, whole grilled rabbits, fresh ham, and U-10 head on prawns were cooking. Additional items inside were Grilled Asparagus, Duck Liver and Romesco, an artisanal cheese board, grilled corn, and a refreshing hibiscus drink.\u000a\u000aAs always, the spread was FANTABULOUS! I noticed people were hardly touching the grilled prawns, and this lady was directly in front of them whining to her husband...yes, she was being a whiner vaginer because all the prawn juice was getting all over her hands..."Use a napkin dear!?" said the husband in a sarcastic way...LOL! She stood there feeling "icky" and I grabbed a couple of those bad boys, gave her a "step aside lady, I'll show you how its done" look, twisted the head off and sucked the head juice followed with an "Oh yeah!"...:) Finally the Grilled Rabbit Board made its way to the counter and what a treat it was! I'd never had grilled rabbit before but it was so tender and juicy, totally the opposite of what I was expecting.\u000a\u000aAll good things come to an end, and this grub fest continued on but we had to bail because we had less than 15 minutes to get to the movies up the street at Galaxy. Looking forward to the next one!..............ALOHA!!!

VWow! Glad we made a little "pit stop" here from a last-minute invite, this time for a Foie Gras Affair from Junny Gonzalez and Sonoma Artisan Foie Gras.\u000a\u000aAlthough there's still a ban in California(but chefs still serve it up on the DL anyway) Junny and her husband Guillermo have managed to resume production in upstate New York after being shut down in Sonoma, California and are celebrating 29 years of excellence this year. My first encounter with Foie Gras were my days as an aspiring chef at The Culinary Institute of America where I made a Foie Gras Terrine with Sauternes Gelee for our Grand Buffet in Garde Manger Class, and I couldn't understand what the deal was with this goose liver and why people kept coming back for it!?!? After my first taste, I could see why, and what I've been missing out on!\u000a\u000aSonoma Artisan Foie Gras is one of THE BEST I've tasted, and also brought flashbacks of making an abundance of Torchon de Foie Gras at Bouchon in Napa Valley, and many "taste tests" before packing the mason Jars...Had to check the quality, you know what I mean?...;) We were treated to endless amounts of Foie Gras Terrine, Duck Rillettes, and Duck Breast with a Green Peppercorn Sauce. As if that wasn't enough, Artisinal Cheeses and some Mortadella were also available. We also had "dessert" courtesy of Brett and Junny...The Foie Gras French Toast was BUTTAH!!!  I am definitely anxious to see what else Brett and the team at Artisinal Foods have in store in the future!....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aP.S. Get on the mailing list for the next event!!!  Your Welcome....;)

VBest FOOT Spa......that's about it....when it came time for the body massage,that's when things got outta control.\u000a\u000aElaine(Eileen?) was my masseuse and boy did she try her hardest to untangle my knots. I asked her to ease off on the presssure and it was cool, and I was starting to fall asleep but was surprisingly awakened after a few minutes when she squeezed the Charmin.....TWICE! I was like WTH?!?!?!\u000a\u000aAnd the phone calls kept coming, which messed up the zen moment....\u000aOverall, it was aight....ALOHA!!!

VUpdate AND upgrade: After a hectic work week, our escape is usually a dosage of omega action provided by the Goyemon Boyz. We were grubbin' at the bar, and wifey was feeling tense and needed a massage. Best Foot Spa wasn't far away and open til late, so we phoned in our appointments and gave it another go.\u000a\u000aWe got our same private room and I didn't get the massuses' names, but right away, they went to work. The foot soak action was awesome especially for being on my feet all week. My massuse was very attentive, always checking if I was fine with the pressure, etc..after working my neck and shoulders, I still felt knotted up, so instead of the head massage, I requested extra time with my neck and shoulders. Now this is where it becomes like an episode of WWE Smackdown!\u000a\u000aShe switched me to the smaller(foot) chair, pillow in my lap, and face in the pillow. Immediately kneading, chopping and slapping away the knots one by one. Boy ,did it hurt so good, but she wasn't done yet....there must've been some stubborn knots because she applied both her elbows to my trapezius muscles at full throttle, and it got even HEAVIER. I could hear her feet leave the ground and touch the ground again, 3-4 times\u000acontinuously. I didn't know if I wanted to yell "uncle" or bust out laughing! Man, what a no-holds-barred match that was. I've heard of a "monkey on my back", but I literally had a MASSUSE on my back!\u000a\u000aNow on my stomach, she continues with my neck, to my shoulders and down my back which is very soothing .This time though, instead of squeezing the charmin gently, she does does a full-on ASS GRAB as if she were kneading dough for bread...does everyone else get those ass grabs too!?!?!? It wasn't painful or anything, just kinda awkward. I just thought everyhing below the belt and above the hamstring was a no-no..\u000a\u000aThis time, on my back she went to work on my arms, and as I'm in the moment, this rude lady comes in and starts chatting with Rex like they were the only two people in the room about some movie she'd seen.Really??? Man, this Roger Ebert wannabe is lucky a wall separated us! As my massuse continued, she hit pressure points that I never knew pain existed(forearms, achiles,etc.) and she even put the "Sleeper"\u000ahold on me! Not once, but TWICE! I even caught myself snoozing off, and wifey was keepin' it together from busting out in laughter! My 60 minute session finally came to an end and it was definitely satisfying. Yup, we're fans....:) ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(170/365) "Smackdown at the Spa!"

VThis one is right up there with Greenland and Glaziers...Cardenas has ALL your fiesta needs under one roof...From pinatas for the kiddies and with Cinco de Mayo just around the corner, this place is gonna be jumpin...wait, it already is!\u000a\u000aTheir produce selection is ENOURMOUS and the pastries, pan dulce, and sweets in the bakery section are addicting! Jonezing for Tres Leches? they got it in traditional, coffee(YUM!) , and strawberry. Definitely makes Firefly's version look like A$$(How you like them apples???)\u000a\u000aTheir tortilleria is awesome too! Chips, Tostadas, Sopes, Huaraches and Tortillas of every shape and size! They even have blue corn tortillas and cactus(nopales) flavored ones that I'm curious to try!\u000a\u000aI even saw prepared flavored masa for sweet tamales\u000a\u000aA trip to Cardenas wouldn't be complete without stopping by the food court...On our first visit,(this review is like three visits in one)\u000awe shared a Carne Asada Burrito,Tacos de Tripa(Crispy Beef Intestine), Tamal Dulce, and a Torta Cubano which was pretty good, but I love their Agua Fresca selections. My favorites are the Horchata, Pina, and Fresa con Leche(flavors change daily)\u000a\u000aOn our second visit, wifey picked up some things and we had Tostadas de Ceviche and Huaraches con Picadillo...awesome dinner\u000a\u000aOn our third visit, we picked up some of their delicious grilled chicken for lunch(comes with tortillas, pico de gallo, and beans(cooked in lard-yuck!)\u000aand headed to the park for a picnic with Dolce.\u000a\u000aDefinitely go on Saturdays when they have the sample booths out all over the store...you can get you shopping AND lunch at the same time...ALOHA!!!

VMy one stop shop for all my fiesta needs, it was already close to lunch time, so I picked up some pollo and produce-by the way, the meat and produce selections here are among the BEST in town, forget the "chains"...(Albertsons, Vons, Smiths,etc)\u000a\u000aI always get an agua fresca(super size, of course) everytime we come here, and they had my favorites, leche con fresa(milk and strawberry) and pepino (cucumber) but on this day, it wasn't gonna happen. It was a madhouse, and definitely the busiest of our 3 stops and the lines were just too long, so I just grabbed some fresh tostadas and shrimp ceviche which was our quick style lunch, some brewskis, and the best chicharrones in town to hold our guests over for dinner.\u000a\u000a If you love crispy pork skin, this is the place to get it, they come in huge sheets, or pieces, which I prefer because\u000aits perfectly salted and still has crispy rendered fat attached to the skin, the sheets don't..they're also happy to give you a sample of anything before you decide on your purchase...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(143/365) "Supermarket Sweep Part 3"

VSweet Addiction has been bookmarked to try, but now, I no longer need to...why???\u000abecause I can have my own sweet addiction at home PLUS more to enjoy later.\u000a\u000aYes folks, Cardenas now carries just about every flavor of THRIFTY"S ice cream for only $3.99, which is only a little more than one cookie sandwich @ Sweet Addiction.\u000agrab your favorite cookie dough, and bake your own cookies at home. Here's a pro tip-SCOOP your cookie dough instead of cutting it, and  cut out a couple of minutes on the baking time for a soft, chewy cookie. Pick up your favorite flavor(s) and sandwich it between the freshly baked cookies, and you'll be amazed how many ice cream sandwiches you get!\u000a\u000aWe're still enjoying our Black Cherry and Chocolate Malt Crunch ice creams as I'm writing this...Oh, your welcome!....ALOHA!!!

VGot to see them on their second to last night at The Flamingo for their limited engagement. I  hope in the future they return to Vegas and find a permanent spot to entertain the fans.\u000a\u000aThey sounded just as great as when they first started 20 years ago. It was also cool that they sang a medley of Motown hits and fans even got to see a little of ther comedic sides.\u000a\u000aOverall, a great show and an awesome way to end the night!  ALOHA!!!

VCame here for dinner which was about $27-28 per person, on weeknights(Weekends are slightly higher)\u000a\u000aDidn't take long to get in, which was good. Before we chow down, I decide to browse the buffet end to end snapping photos along the way.\u000a\u000aYou have your standard food stations-Japanese, Chinese, Carving station, Pasta, Pizza, and Flatbread, International, cold foods, breads, and salads, and on the far Right side of the dining room, Desserts and sweets.\u000a\u000aNice decor and great concept having individual portions of some of their selections, but it makes you wonder if and how long will they keep this concept....dishes will chip and break, and it will be a challenge to keep the mini pots and pans well maintained. \u000a\u000aA few items were offered here that I haven't seen at other buffets:\u000aLamb Ribs, Roasted Bone Marrow, BBQ Shrimp and Bacon and Cheddar Grits, Chicken Liver Mousse, Pork Rillettes, and even Fromage de Tete(Head Cheese)\u000a\u000aA few of the Items still didn't have names,(like how Studio B was when they first opened) but luckily, I reconoticed just about everything that was offered.\u000a\u000aHere's my Hits and Misses for the evening:\u000aHits:\u000aRoasted Bone Marrow-Spread some of that goodness on toasted bread and top it off with parsley salad, red onion jam, and a pinch of salt...Addicting!\u000a\u000aKing Crab Legs- Leg Chunks de-shelled and individually plated, brushed with butter and herbs. Very sweet and tasty, also cost effective and visually smart. You don't see a swarm of people grabbing plates full like at Bellagio or Wynn, no messy hands or piles of crab shell at the table either!\u000a\u000aBBQ Shrimp and Bacon and Cheddar Grits-Tasted as good as it sounds!\u000a\u000a"Fries with eyes"-Crispy Fried Smelt with a pair of remoulades, regular and spicy-Crunchy goodness!\u000a\u000aLamb Ribs-well seasoned, nicely charred and fall-off-the-bone good!\u000a\u000aTaleggio and truffle oil flatbread-anything truffle is BOMB!\u000a\u000aRillettes and Chicken Liver Mousse were pretty tasty too....\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMisses:\u000aDim Sum, 3 kinds-Siu Mai, Har Gao, and Sticky rice in lotus Leaf-go to chinatown\u000aSushi-california, Shrimp tempura, and spicy tuna,-not too appetizing\u000aRisotto- Impossible to serve at a buffet unless done a la minute in small batches-it was gummy...\u000a\u000aDesserts-Looked better than they tasted....especially the ones in the glasses and fancy containers.....\u000aChocolate covered apples? what about caramel and candied apples?\u000aMini pastries and desserts were sooooooSWEET, and so were the gelatos and sorbets-too much sugar and stabilizers...\u000aCrepes tasted like the packaged ones-cold and rubbery.\u000a\u000aWicked Spoon definitely needs fine tuning......ALOHA!!!

VAfter the Enrique Iglesias concert, we headed downstairs towards the world's largest chandelier to join in the Mexican Independence Day festivities. A Mariachi band was jammin' tunes all the way live.\u000a\u000aWe didn't grab any cocktails because it was a madhouse! we stayed for a couple of songs, then bailed since it was a work night. Maybe we'll return on a much slower night to sit back, relax, and enjoy one of their much talked about craft cocktails.  ALOHA!!!

VAfter the Yelp Helps kick-off party, we (and tons of other yelpers as well!) decided to pop in for a slice. Two things have changed for the worse since I've last visited-\u000aThe slices are a lot smaller, and its $5 a slice now...WTH???\u000a\u000aI was in line with wifey and Sarah-Marie, and all 3 of us had planned on getting white pizza which obviously is a popular one. I look over to see how many slices there are and we see one slice left.. The two parties ahead of us don't order any, and just before it is our turn to order, the last slice is taken. Meanwhile, there are THREE COOKS behind the counter. Tweedle Dee is running the register and popping slices in the oven, Tweedle Dumb is moving like molasses, making a pizza at cruise control speed while the line is growing even longer, Sarah Marie asks if more white pizza is gonna be made\u000aand  Tweedle Dumber's answer? "No, not any time soon." Really? All the ingredients are staring you in the face and you couldn't hustle to get another one in the oven?\u000aWifey and Sarah Marie got other slices cause he was to lazy to get another one going.\u000a\u000aAfter BS like that, I wish There was a way to give no stars. Nico took all of them when he left...ALOHA!!!

VYet another dissappointment in my quest to find Mexican food with soul...\u000a\u000aNot far from The Broadacres Swap Meet, we drive towards this big sign that reads" Las Islitas Mariscos Estillo Nayarit"...The Region of Nayarit, Mexico is well known for their seafood specialities, so we thought\u000aThis has gotta be good!\u000a\u000aThe first good sign-a PACKED parking Lot\u000a\u000aWe step inside, I'm hoping not to see abuelita upfront making tortillas a mano(fingers crossed)-YES! another good sign....\u000a\u000aInstead, tables are packed with the majority being Hispanics(Go where the locals go,right?) and not one, not two, but THREE different bands are going table to table(2 Mariachi bands and 1 Ranchero Band) taking song requests as you dine.\u000a\u000aService staff are hustling in and out of the kitchen with all kinds of seafood specialities trying to get orders to the guests ASAP....We finally get sat at a tiny booth in the corner and I'm eager to see the menu.\u000a\u000aSo we decide on a mixed seafood Campechana-seafood cocktail with shrimp, octopus, oysters, and abalone, and a plate of Pulpitos, or sauteed baby octopus as suggested by our waitress.\u000a\u000aI guess the dissapointment set in after the first bite. Both dishes looked better than they tasted....the octopus was rubbery from being overcooked.\u000a\u000aThe Campechana tasted watered down and lacked flavor even with all that seafood inside. we kept having to season it with condiments on our table. Even worse was the unadvertised addition of imitation\u000acrab meat!\u000a\u000aDid we order the wrong things? Kitchen have an off day?  Hard to say,but hard to say if this restaurant does Nayarit any justice...ALOHA!!!

VBack from the Sloppi Jo's launch, and lots of people came out for support and to feast on Las Vegas' latest addition to the food truck scene, Sloppi Jo's.\u000a\u000aRan into fellow yelpers Chris, Ken, Paolo, and Marianne...Lots of people braved the 35 degree cold(BRRRRRRRR!!!!!) but it was well worth it. We were the 6th customers in line and heres what we decided to attack:\u000a\u000aThe "Sloppi Jo"-Slow roasted pork with a red chile sauce topped with a fried egg and pickled onions.\u000a\u000aGreen Chili Chicken Stew-Chunks of chicken and veggies simmered in a green chili sauce\u000a\u000aPork Taco-with guacamole, pickled onions, and crema\u000a\u000aChicken Taco-with diced green chiles, cheese, and cabbage.\u000a\u000aSopapillas-Fried pillowy goodness dusted with powdered sugar and drizzled with honey butter-a nice sweet ending to a great meal!\u000a\u000aJo and her crew put out some tasty food showcasing the New Mexico Hatch Green Chiles regardless of the opening day jitters, timing issues with the food, and a blown out generator that left the kitchen crew cooking in the dark.\u000a\u000aEvery item we ordered had its own distinctive flavor, and the stew also had a nice heat to it. Both tacos were very tender, well seasoned and unlike any other taco I have ever tasted-in a GOOD way...Mahalo Jolene!!! We'll definitely be back to try the Green Chile Cheeseburger and the breakfast burrito.....ALOHA!!!

This time Russel even stopped in and we got to "talk story" while we were waiting for our order.\u000a\u000aThis spot is good if you're on the go, but Their Sahara location is even better because you get more banchan with your meal and cannot forget the onolicious boiled peanuts!.....ALOHA!!!

VHaven't seen Mary Rose since my first Grubfest in the Tatami Room at Goyemon(a LONG time ago!) So we decided to drop in so we could get our brows did after Amanda's Brunch UYE...Gita and Mercy are two very nice and personable women who can thread like nobody's business!\u000a\u000aThe whole process took about 10 minutes, and wasn't even painful. I took it like a man, and still came out looking like a man! That's one thing  that FET is good about...25% of their clientele are men, and they keep men's brows clean without being feminine....unless of course you REQUEST it and wanna look like a girly-man!?!?\u000a\u000aThey don't take ANY shortcuts here, and only use the finest organic cotton thread which can break every once in a while but won't leave your eyebrows puffed and irritated.\u000a\u000aThanks again Mary Rose, Gita, and Mercy! You've turned a bunch of people into repeat customers, myself included...If you'd rather rock the unibrow or velcro strip,go ahead,  knock yourself out...People will also know that you saved alot of money like Geico by rockin' the brows caveman style!.......ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(67/100) "Man? or Neanderthal?"

V**************************  300TH  REVIEW**************************************\u000a\u000aA cube of perfectly done torchon of FOIE GRAS, wrapped in COTTON CANDY, topped with crushed CORN NUTS....Sound crazy? That's the first taste of perfection that I've ever experienced from the deconstructive, outside-of-the-box thinking mind of Chef Jose' Andre's\u000awhich was about 7-8 years ago, just when the modernist/molecular gastronomy movement was starting to catch fire.\u000a\u000aI've been a huge fan ever since that first encounter, and when I heard he was coming to the Cosmo and setting up a "Restaurant inside of his restaurant", This was immediately bookmarked for a very special occasion. I made reservations for our Anniversary(September 1st)and within a couple of weeks, we were set, Golden Tickets and all!!!\u000a\u000aOur hostess for the evening, Stephani came out to greet us and busts out the i-pad wine list to help us decide on our drinking preferences in addition to the $160-Dinner only price ($105 for the alcoholic beverage pairings-6 wines, a beer, and 2 cocktails) pairing or $55 for the non-alcoholic beverage pairing)I decided to go "all-in" and get the total package...my wifey and I shared it with each course and it worked out perfectly. If you're reading this and you are VERY SERIOUS about dining here, trust me, and get the alcohol pairings for the ultimate experience....\u000a\u000aThe time has come, and we are led back to the restaurant, and as you step inside the theater/dining room/laboratory, you are directed to a U-shaped counter where you will enjoy your dinner and a show in one for the next 2.5 hours. This room has to be the most whimsical, yet entertaining and inviting room I've ever had a meal in- card catalogs along either side of the wall decorated with antiques and trinkets Chef Andres has collected from Spain and Las Vegas, a vintage typewriter that Stephani uses to type out your bill at the end of the evening...a red face with a devilish grin, a boustier from an actual showgirl, and a pair of high heels going up a ladder!?!?!?...This room is a reflection of chef Andres' mind....\u000a\u000aAs we are seated, we are given some Cava ( Gran Riserva La Ticota,2006) which is presented in a Perron, a drinking vessel for wine commonly used in Spain-no glasses needed, just tilt your head back and point the spout directly into your mouth-Totally cool and tasty!\u000a\u000aWe were given a total of 23 different tastings, and  they were in this order:\u000a\u000a1) Frozen Gin and Tonic(Our "welcome" drink)-prepared right before your eyes using liquid  nitrogen, slushy,citrusy, and refreshing way to awaken the palette of what's ahead.\u000a\u000aJose's "Snacks":\u000a\u000a2) Spanish "Clavel" or Carnation in English, was a thin, delicate crisp in the form of a carnation with fruity, floral notes which was presented on an actual cast of Chef Andres' hand\u000a\u000a3) Beet Jewelry-thin strands of beets coiled around and dehydrated to a crisp, tasting almost exactly like Terra beet chips and garnished with some edible silver lustre dust. Stephani had mentioned that in the old days, beets were used to trade for jewelry in Spain.\u000a\u000a4) Caramelized Pork Rinds(Chicharrones)- These came looking like french fries and had a good savory/caramel taste with a nice crunch to it.\u000a\u000aJose's "Tapas":\u000a\u000a5) Apple Brazo de Gitano("Gypsy's Arm") A cylinder of dehydrated apple meringue filled with a bleu cheese espuma topped with a praline cream, a "cheese plate" in 2-3 bites.\u000a\u000a6) Crispy Chicken Skin in Escabeche- A very plump chicken oyster(that "nugget" of chicken you find in a chicken thigh) in escabeche sauce on a very crispy sheet of chicken skin topped with thyme air and powdered thyme,  I let out a little laugh as I was shaking my head.\u000aenjoying all the textures and flavors of this 2-bite tasting.\u000a\u000a7) Jose's Taco- A slice of the king of pork, Iberico de Bellota, or "The black-footed pig that was fully acorn fed") topped with a dollop of Rio Frio caviar(sustainable Sturgeon) I was still coming off that high from the previous tasting, I rolled that bad boy up and ate it all up without remembering to get a photo:( luckily, there are pictures posted from other yelpers:)\u000a\u000a8) Artichoke with Caviar-Crisp and creamy artichoke heart topped with a fried quail egg and also topped with Rio Frio caviar, another very tasty bite.\u000a\u000a9) Bocata de "Calamares"- Chef Andres grew up near the ocean, and enjoyed fried calamari sandwiches as a childhood favorite. In his version, Uni (Sea Urchin Roe) replaces the calamari, and is prepared "rebosado" or egg battered and flash fried, served on a brioche bun with cucumbers, green onions, and aioli. I LOVE anything \u000auni, and wifey's not a big fan, BUT she loved this tasting as well.\u000a\u000aWe enjoyed the above tastings with a very prized Sherry, Hidalgo Pastrana Manzanilla Pasada.\u000a\u000a10) "Sandria"- So we finished up the tapas round with a last bite of sandia(watermelon) that had been compressed with sangria, hence the name which Chef Andres playfully suggested.

VHope I don't need a third page!!!! Here it goes......\u000a\u000a11) Ajo Blanco- Classially made with garlic, this version was,  made with almonds and other components included a tomato-manzanilla granita, Pedro Ximenez "noodles" made from agar-agar, marcona almonds and almond dust, diced grapes, and micro greens. Very refreshing soup.\u000a\u000a12) Lobster with Citrus and Jasmine- Perfectly done lobster with a lemon pith puree, citrus pieces and zest, lobster head sauce, and jasmine foam. Chef Andres wanted the diner to experience a little "Spanish Summer" with the essence of jasmine. This was paired beautifully with Estrella Damm Inedit, a beer from the proprietors of El Bulli, Ferran Adria and Juli Soler. Definitely one of the favorites among everyone.\u000a\u000a13) Chickpea Stew with Iberico Ham- Chef Andres' take on Chickpea Stew consisted of an Iberico sauce from rendered iberico ham fat, chickpea "spheres",  diced iberico ham fat, and chorizo and parsley oils. (Tasting 13 was paired with a Rioja, R.Lopez de Heredia Vina Tondonia Riserva, 2000)\u000a\u000a14) Catch of the day- A meaty piece of Turbot was cooked to perfection and paired with charred green onion oil, micro shiso, arugula, citrus"pearls" and black garlic. (Tasting 14 was paired with a Galgueira Godello, NV)\u000a\u000a15) Rosemary Wild Mushrooms in Papillote- Morels and Chantrelles were cooked in a heat-proof plastic pouch with a flavorful mushroom broth and a mushroom cream sauce topped with a rosemary air.\u000a\u000a16)Secreto of Iberico Pork- Our third tasting containing this prized Spanish black footed pig, this time was prepared with a rarely used, uncured cut behind the shoulder of the pig. I am pretty sure it was prepared sous vide(cooking food in a tightly sealed plastic bag at a controlled temperature resulting in even cooking and a juicier product)\u000a Presented on a slate plate(Spain's hillsides contain alot of slate, and another element Chef Andres wanted to incorporate)It was a perfect medium rare and tasted like a juicy steak and came with some chicken glace and chantrelles. One of my favorite tastings of the evening.(Tastings 15 and 16 were paired with another Rioja, Vina Ardanza Riserva Especial, 2001)\u000a\u000a17) Orange Pith Puree La Serena( Cheese Course)- Torta de La Serena is a soft sheep's milk cheese and was served with a orange pith puree, candied pimpkin seeds and pumpkin oil. The cheese paired perfectly with the Casta Diva Alicante Muscat, 2008.\u000a\u000a18) Apples and Red Wine "Freddy Giradet"( First Dessert) consisted of grenache poached apples, red wine "spheres" apple puree, vanilla ice cream and micro mint.This was Chef Andres' interpretation of appples and wine.\u000a\u000a19) Frozen Apricot Coulant-(Second Dessert)- Cold fruity exterior and a amaretto-almond toffee caramel inside, this dessert also came with Spanish olive oil, yogurt espuma, and edible marigold petals. (Tastings 18 and 19 were enjoyed with a "Fisherman's Coffee", a drink of reduced rum and coffee.)\u000a\u000a20-23) Fizzy Paper, 25-Second Hazelnut Bizcocho, "Crema Catalana" and "Air Chocolates"(Finale of sweet bites) The fizzy paper was like a pop rocks sheet, the bizcocho(25 seconds in the microwave)  was very soft and creamy inside, the crema catalana was a very sinful bite, and the chocolates were light and delicate. \u000a\u000aWe were also able to sign a little black "guestbook" and express our thoughts of the evening - wifey and I were Diners #1551 and #1552... a couple of cappucinos and a gin and tonic ended our\u000aawesome evening. A very big MAHALO to Stephani, Mia,  Kathy, Lisa and the two gentlemen(forgot your names!) for a very memorable evening!\u000a\u000aBefore you go:\u000a\u000aHours: Wed-Sat, 5:30pm and 8;30pm\u000aThis is an interactive experience...feel free to ask questions and conversate with the staff\u000aCameras are allowed-No flash photography\u000aSavor each bite!!!\u000aGet the beverage pairing, you won't be disappointed\u000aCheck out video clips on Spherification, Sous Vide, and other Modernist cooking techniques to get an idea of what the chefs will be explaining to you.\u000a\u000a**IF YOU'RE A PICKY EATER OR DON'T HAVE AN OPEN MIND, THIS PLACE AIN'T FOR YOU!**\u000a\u000ae'..............Now THAT isThe Cosmopolitan's best kept secret, NOT the pizzeria!!!! ALOHA!!!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(39/365) "Cosmo's best kept secret"

VETHNIC BAKERY TOUR #1-GERMANY\u000a\u000aWe've always driven by this strip mall but never noticed this bakery tucked back in the corner. Not only is this a bakery, but a mini German specialities store as well where a lot of German transplants pick up candies, condiments,and other items for a taste of home.(Curry Ketchup!?!?! COOL!!!) The smell of freshly baked goods immediately draw you in and awaken your tastebuds...(Enter at your own risk!)\u000a\u000aBakery selections are plentiful from different danish, crumb cakes, pretzel breads, almond horns, cheese sticks, and a wide array of whole loaves that they will be happy to slice for you. I was jonezing for some of their Bienenstich, or Beesting Cake which is a yeast dough filled with luscious vanilla custard with a caramelized almond-honey topping, but unfortunately they didn't have any on our visit..:( We settled for a Cherry Danish, a Nut Corner, a Pretzel Bread, a German Cheesecake and a popular item called Frankfurter. The ladies behind the counter are so nice and helpful, they also convinced us to come away with a few goodies!\u000a\u000aI am determined to return for that Beesting Cake!.....ALOHA!!!

VFirst (and possibly last) time I tried Tastybunz was at the first Food Truck Fest....We got 3 bunz-Bacon Bird, Mac N Cheese, and don't remember the other one...Also got their Tocino Slider, and the saving grace was the fried egg on top....Like everyone says, Too much bunz, not enough tasty.\u000a\u000aOverall, not a good first visit...its gonna take alot to get me to pay another visit(I still haven't given Hanshiktaco another visit either)...They'll probably be at the next Food Truck Fest, but I think I'll give other vendors a shot...ALOHA!!!

VFinally stopped in while running some errands since I missed out on the opportunity of getting a limited edition golden ticket shirt at the grand opening last week.:(\u000a\u000aAs you step inside, beats are bangin', graffitti art cover the walls, unique pieces of furniture everywhere, a couple of big screen TVs for your viewing pleasure, and as always, Ric is always there to greet you and ready to feed you some slider luv. There are also NBA JAM and Mortal Kombat II arcade games that are set on free play(according to other reviewers)\u000a\u000aThe menu items and prices are the same with a new section of SUPERFRIES!!!\u000a\u000a1 slider $3\u000a2 Sliders $5\u000a3 sliders $7\u000a*Mystery Slider $5 (Changes Daily)\u000a\u000aSuperfries $5\u000a\u000aBarbyfries- Melted cheddar, bcaon, caramelized jalapeno, and BBQ sauce\u000a\u000aPepfries-Sauteed Onion, bacon, cheddar, and super sauce\u000a\u000aCaptainfries-Sauteed onions, bacon, feta cheese, and balsamic reduction\u000a\u000aSweetpotatosmores-Toasted marshmallow cream, warm chocolate sauce, graham cracker crumble\u000a\u000aAs Ric is taking your order, he has some scooby snack action for the customers as well."Don't be shy!" he says, referring to the deep fried mac and cheese and deep fried cheesecake bites that you can munch on while waiting for your grub.\u000a\u000aSo I go for a Yaya slider, today's "mystery" slider: Tequila-Lime  Marinated Steak Slider with jack cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, and Guacamole AND an order of Sweetpotatosmores Superfries.\u000a\u000aCrazy as it sounds, the saltiness of the sliders actually paired well with the sweetpotatosmores fries, chocolate sauce, marshmallows and all!\u000a\u000aAs I finish up my lunch, Ric says" Here you go brother, just a little something on the house"... swings by and hands me a couple of cupcake sliders!

VWe all stopped in after a day at the driving range and decided to  give Abuela's a try.\u000aI've Taco'd well over 500 times, in various taquerias, roach coaches, and street corners, and any time fresh tortillas are made, it is always a good plus when looking for a tasty taco.\u000a\u000aWe shared a taco combo which came with two tacos with rice, beans OR chips and salsa, but a few of us didn't see the OR part and we asked for chips and salsa as well...Oooops! The chips were stale and we just pushed them to the side. Wifey got an Asada Taco, and I got a Lengua Taco which was very soft and tasty, and the sides weren't bad either.\u000a\u000aDon't forget to use your Yelp Check-In offer for a free Churro which is filled with a dulce de leche cream...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(270/365) " Gracias Abuelita!"

VAlso tucked away in Smarty's and very close neighbor to Thrifty's Ice Cream is Chigago Jimmy's. He has a VERY extensive menu, but we were jonezing for a Chicago-Style hot dog, so we ordered a couple and boy were those hot dogs DELICIOUS! That snap that you'll only get from an all beef hot dog, tartness of the pickles, the heat from the chiles, freshness of the onions and tomatoes, and that neon green relish that you only find in a Chicago Dog....as close as you can get to authentic, or at least according to Jimmy...he has tried to duplicate his dogs using ingredients from Vegas, but he wasn't getting that Chicago Taste, so he's been getting everything from Chicago down to the poppy seed bun.\u000a\u000aNext time you're headed to Smarty's, give Chicago Jimmy's a try, THEN have dessert at Thrifty's...ALOHA!!!

VThis place isn't VPN approved like Settebello is, but Settebello, you've got competition!\u000a\u000aThe two wood burning ovens are the main attraction in the dining room(hence the restaurant's name) and if you like a crispy, chewy crust, Napoletana is the way to go-baked at 900 Degrees for no more than 90 seconds.\u000a\u000aIf you like a crispy cracker style crust, Romana is the way to go-baked at 500 degrees for 3 minutes.\u000a\u000aHere is what we attacked:\u000a\u000aChef's Meat and Cheese Platter-kinda skimpy, not worth the price\u000a\u000aTartufo(Napoletana)-Truffles, mushrooms, over easy egg-nuff' said....\u000a(if you plan to take a picture, let the server know you'll break the egg, before they turn it into a "show" and ruin your photo opp-AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!)\u000a\u000aDessert Pizza-Pretty forgettable....your're better off getting a Margherita Pizza instead.\u000a\u000aRicotta Cheese with Honey and Toasted Pistachios-The star of the desserts!\u000adefinitely do not pass this one up!\u000a\u000aPlanning to return to try other pizzas, the mozzarella bar, and more of that BOMB ricotta,,,ALOHA!!!

VCame back for Anthony M.s UYE and this time got to try a few other stuff:\u000a\u000aMeatballs- kinda on the salty side for me\u000a\u000aGnocchi-if you wanna call it that, looked more like overgrown orzo pasta and didn't have a potatoey, pillowy texture you should get from a gnocchi. Good flavor, just like Yard Houses' Mac and Cheese...\u000a\u000aFour Cheese, Due Forni, and Bianco with Prosciutto and Egg were great. Also surprisingly good was the Margherita with the Roman style crispy crust.\u000aand of course we got theTartufo Pizza and Ricotta Cheese for dessert-YUM!\u000a\u000aGood food, good people, good times...ALOHA!!!

VUh Oh Settebello, better step your game up......\u000a\u000aWe stopped in for lunch and its been a while since we've dined here. After browsing the menu, we decided to order some of the newer additions to the menu-The Polipo\u000a(octopus appetizer), The Tagliata(skirt steak with spinach, goat cheese, and tomatoes to start, and we split the special pizza of the day, didn't get the name, but it featured Bresola(air dried beef), Cassatica Cheese(a very creamy mozzarella), spinach, evoo, and onions.(Neapolitan Style)\u000a\u000aThe Polipo was very soft and tasty and the tomatoes, capers and olives complemented\u000athe octopus well. The skirt steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and went well with the spinach, tomatoes and goat cheese. Our pizza was the best tasting pizza we've had in a while, I'd order this one again, and I think it replaced my former favorite, the truffle pizza. Crispy chewy crust, well charred on the bottom, the bresola had a nice saltiness,\u000athe cassatica cheese tasted more like a gooey brie, the fruitiness of the evoo, and the sweetness of the onion made every bite very enjoyable.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, we order our usual, Creamy Buffala Ricotta with Honey and Toasted Pistachios AND I just had to try their new addition-Chocolate Gelato covered  with Nueske's Applewood Smoked BACON !?!?!?!? The Ricotta is always a winner, but WOW!\u000athis bacon made me feel like I was at a luau, because it tasted EXACTLY like Pipikaula, a popular smoked dried meat you find at luaus and Hawaiian food joints...Perfect contrast of sweet and salty with a little smokiness to it. Definitely try this if you're adventureous...ALOHA!!!!\u000a\u000a**RECOMMENDATIONS**\u000a\u000aBresola Pizza with Cassatica Cheese, Onions, and Spinach(Neapolitan Style)\u000a\u000aBuffala Ricotta with Honey and Toasted Pistachios\u000a\u000aChocolate Gelato with Nueske's Applewood Smoked Bacon\u000a\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(161/365) " Chocolate and Bacon"

VAfter Paolo's Foto Walk, we decided to  get a little drinky drink. I  really liked  the open space and the cool artwork on the walls.  The lighting and decor along with the chill vibe makes this place really inviting.\u000a\u000aOur bartender was great in helping us choose our drinks and she made them quick and efficiently. As we finished our drinks, we were also getting kinda hungry, so off we went to Kabob Korner.\u000a\u000aDefinitely returning in the future...ALOHA!!!

VDecided to check this place out after having some Freddy's next door. Similar menu to the one in Chinatown with a menu full of snacks and savory items too.\u000a\u000aI always rotate between my 3 favorites- # 50 Lychee Coconut, Avocado, and Taro. I also get the biggest cup possible (32oz.). This location is alot cleaner and spacious too. #50 this time, and it tastes exactly like I always get it when I'm in Chinatown.\u000a\u000aI'm gonna have to return to try some of their food items in the future since the other location doesn't offer those items....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(70/100) "No. 1 Boba-Version 2.0"

VCame here for the first time during their happy hour. I like the wide selection of  Japanese tapas Kyara has. You also get a free appetizer with your Yelp Check-in!\u000a\u000aOf all the tasty morsels that arrived at our table, standouts for me were the deep fried mozzarella with fig jam, saba, deep fried squid tentacles, ankimo(monkfish liver), and the salmon-ikura bowl.\u000a\u000aPass on the zaru soba(go to I-Naba) and the chicken skin as also poorly executed. Assorted skewers were tasty though. Great that they're open late to satisfy your hunger...ALOHA!!!

VWOW! What hasn't been said about this "breath of fresh air" of a show on the strip?\u000a\u000aAbsinthe has it all-comedy, circus, burlesque, and tons of profanity! All of the acts were great, and the mouths on Penny and The Gazillionaire had us ROLLIN"!!!!!! There was also a bit of eye candy for the guys and Gals.\u000a\u000aThe audience participation on stage could've been better if they 'went with the flow" and didn't hold back as much...motorboating and kissing the Gazillionaire? Hilarious!!! \u000aSome of the audience caused a little scare for a moment during the final balancing act where one of the performers lost his balance for a split second because people were suppposed to remain silent until the last performer got off the high wire! Great recovery!\u000aI would most definitely pay again to see this show!\u000a\u000aThe meet and greet/photo op was the cherry on top, and for those of you who are afraid to live a little and just can't take a joke, this show isn't for you...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP CHALLENGE 365-(157/365) "The Vegas Show with No Filter"

VStopped in after the Kapena Concert at the Pure Aloha Festival, and I can honestly say that Sushi House Goyemon, the latest venture from the Mon Group(Sushi Mon, Monta Ramen) has become my new stomping grounds for AYCE sushi.\u000a\u000aI've been a regular at Sushi Mon on Silverado Ranch and Maryland Parkway\u000asince 2004, and SHG's AYCE Sushi menu is absolutely the same, AND MORE!\u000a\u000aUpon entering, we usually hear "Irashai-masse!", but instead, Chef Fredo laughingly yells out "What, you guys don't go to Sushi-Mon anymore???"\u000aYup, da boyz are all here-Fredo, Hiro, and Jun from the OG Sushi-Mon Crew...\u000a\u000aSo we sit up at the bar, do a little catching up, and finally let Fredo take us on a sushi journey, omakase style. We're very familiar with the AYCE Sushi Menu, so Fredo bombards us with "additions" to the AYCE menu only found at SHG.\u000a\u000aHere's what we attacked:\u000a\u000aHawaiian Bigeye Tuna nigiri with ponzu\u000aCajun Salmon nigiri\u000aSpicy Tuna on Crispy Rice (2X)\u000aGrilled Pork Belly with Mango(aka Crack Bacon)\u000aCold Tofu with condiments\u000aKanpachi and Suzuki(Japanese Sea Perch) nigiri\u000aOrgasm Salad\u000aGrilled Vegetables with Miso dressing(2X)\u000aHamachi-Jalapeno nigiri\u000aAmaebi nigiri\u000a\u000aEach and every bite was perfection! For Dessert we wanted to try their new desserts (1 per person) so the waitress suggested we try all 3, so that's just what we did!\u000a\u000aGreen Tea Creme Brulee\u000aTofu Cheesecake with yuzu and mango\u000aGreen Tea Cake with Chestnut Cream\u000a\u000aAll were very light tasting and weren't overly sweet at all...\u000a\u000aHere's a couple little factoids:\u000a\u000a-SHG is where SHIN YAKITORI was (S Decatur and Hacienda)\u000a\u000a-You can also enjoy Monta Shoyu Ramen after 11pm\u000a\u000a-You can use your Sushi-Mon stamp card here as well(How Sweet is That!?)\u000a\u000a-Alot of Vegas chefs come here as well(owners from Ichiza and Nobu's sushi chef were there as well)\u000a\u000a-a tatami room is under renovation that will be able to acommodate 25 people\u000a\u000aWith that being said, the only question to ask is.........ARE YOU READY TO STEP OUT WITH THE HUNGRY HAWAIIAN??????\u000a\u000aThat's Right, another UYE from yours truly coming soon....ALOHA!!!!!!

VNot even a week later, we're sitting up at the bar ready to attack...as we enter,\u000awe don't hear "Irashai-Masse! ", Again Fredo laughingly says"Back already!? Not even one week!" That's what happens when you serve up the best AYCE Sushi in town....And I KNOW that I'm not the only one who feels that way(It'll soon be at the top of the "Hot on Yelp" List)\u000a\u000aAgain, we let Fredo "feed us" and along with the usual suspects-\u000aSpicy Tuna w/ Crispy Rice, Grilled Vegetables, and "Crack Bacon"\u000awe also grubbed on the following:\u000a\u000aSides:\u000aGilled Tofu with Sesame Dressing\u000aYakisoba\u000aSashimi Salad\u000aBaked Mussels\u000aDeep Fried Amaebi Heads\u000aHamachi Kama\u000aTako Poke\u000a\u000aSushi Specials:\u000aSmoked Salmon\u000aKanpachi\u000aKobe Beef\u000aHawaiian Bigeye Tuna\u000aAnago(Sea Eel)\u000a\u000aand even more Sushi...\u000aSuper White Tuna\u000aHamachi Belly \u000aSalmon\u000aIkura\u000aCajun Albacore\u000aSpicy Tuna with Quail Egg            \u000aFresh Scallop\u000aAmaebi\u000aUni\u000aSpider Hand Roll\u000aPuffy Roll\u000a\u000aDesserts:\u000aGreen Tea Cake\u000aGreen Tea Creme Brulee\u000aLychee Sorbet\u000aTempura Ice Cream\u000aGreen Tea Ice Cream\u000a\u000aGreat food, awesome company.....Looking forward to our next visit!\u000aTatami Room still under construction, but I'm still planning the UYE\u000aon a Friday night, some time in June....Stay Tuned!!!\u000aThe Sushi Bar at Goyemon seems to be the tougher seat to get because\u000aon this visit, people were actually waiting for spots to open up at the bar, and there were a few empty tables...\u000a\u000aTo those who have become Addicted to "Crack Bacon" aka Grilled Pork Belly, don't abuse it to the point where it would have to be removed from the menu...They(Sushi-Mon) used to serve raw oysters, and hamachi Kama is a 1 per person item due to the "abuse"....this is an actual observation of the sushi chefs, so I hope people will take that into consideration. so everyone can enjoy without any restrictions.\u000a\u000aAlso, don't be a douchebag and text away half the time while the chefs\u000aare trying to serve you at the bar,(they didn't look happy) and other people are  also waiting to eat at the bar....RESPECT THE SUSHI CHEFS!!!!!....ALOHA!!!!

VThis is gonna be a three update in one kind of an update cause we've been back three times since my UYE, and all three times were nothing short of excellent...\u000a\u000aOne week after my UYE, we ended up here after the movies, about 11pm and stopped in for a late night snacky snack...Along with our usual sushi arsenal of nigiris, rolls, and side orders, one of the specials was Giant Clam. Unfortunately, they were out....fortunately for us, Fredo utilized the Giant Clam trimmings and whipped up some deep fried Giant Clam strips which were crisp and sweet! Another great sushi fest as we stayed until last call and shut the place down:)\u000a\u000aOne day after Judd and Lynn's UYE at Big Wong, we found ourselves here, this time in the dining room grubbing on some omega action and we were early enough to indulge in some Bluefin Tuna and Toro among our usuals, then came our mini dessert buffet where we ordered just about every dessert on the menu.Good times,happy tummys!\u000a\u000aWe popped in early today and did we come on a good day! We avoided  the crowd and Fredo went all Iron Chef on us again whipping up stuff that wasn't even on the menu aside from our usual requests...."Shhhh, this ain't on the menu tonight." The\u000aNegitoro was sooo fatty and just melted in your mouth. Next was the Conch and Seafood Salad which kinda tasted like sweet abalone-YUM! Lastly was the Deep Fried White Clam Strips which were just as good as the Giant Clam Strips we had a  couple of visits ago.\u000aAlso making a surprise appearance on the special nigiris list was a couple of Hawaiian Snappers-Crimson Snapper(Onaga) and Grey Snapper(Uku)-so delicate and sweet, I had to get two orders of each.\u000aThe Bluefin Tuna and Kampachi were equally good....Still no Hamachi Kama available due to the Japan earthquake situation...ALOHA!!!

VDropped by again after Church to get our omega action on. Already at 6pm on a Saturday, there was a wait, luckily we only waited 20 minutes and a couple of spots opened up right in front of Fredo.\u000a\u000aNot needing the menu at all because of our 15+ repeat visits here(I should've been the Duke by now, but we still own "Stupid Phones") Out come the nigiri specials of the night:\u000a\u000aTrout\u000a\u000aKampachi\u000a\u000aBonito\u000a\u000aAji\u000a\u000aJapanese Snapper\u000a\u000aFreshness as always...We also tried each grilled fish special:\u000a\u000aAhi  with Mango Salsa\u000a\u000aMahimahi with Tomato Salsa\u000a\u000aHamachi with Ponzu\u000a\u000aWe continued with our usual nigiri and sides, then Fredo hands us one of his special rolls-Tempura, cucumber, and avocado wrapped in salmon and topped with yuzu tobiko served with a trio of sauces(unagi, yum-yum, and sriracha)-Outstanding!\u000a\u000aThen, homeboy(yup, Fredo's a PEARL CITY boy too) says "Don't order anything, I got something for you".....10 minutes later, he hands us the biggest, meatiest hamachi kama you've ever seen! That thing was all bones in minutes! We were stuffed, but still had room for the Plum Wine Jello special and some Lychee sherbet...Of course we'll be back!....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(8/365) "My Sushi Stomping Grounds"

VAfter the family got checked in at Caesars Palace, I went straight from work and met them at Goyemon, knowing the place was already packed and that there was gonna be a little wait. Put my name down for a party of 5, said "Howzit" to Da Boys, and checked out the Specials chalkboard-Baby Abalone, Masago Jalapeno, White Clam, Negitoro, and Cajun Tuna-NICE!!!\u000a\u000aWe waited about 30-45 minutes for our table, so beforehand, I kinda got a feel for what our guests liked/disliked, etc...they were easy to please, assuring me they eat anything and everything, they were hella hungry, and were trusting me to order whatever... Alrighty then, let this"method to the madness"  BEGIN!!!  This is how I attack....\u000a\u000aRound 1-all the sushi specials of the night-most sushi joints in town have the same standard nigiri offerings, so its a good thing to grab the specials first, because they do run out, and specials change daily.\u000a\u000aRound 2-the blue and white placemat-available at dinner only, we order our favorites-Spicy Tuna Rice Cracker, Grilled Vegetables, and of course, "crack bacon"....MMMMM! this is SO good! and "Better than what we have in Chico" are what  you hear during the first two rounds, and no signs of anyone slowing down, so I order up the next round.\u000a\u000aRound 3-assorted nigiri and side orders-ahi poke, fried calamari, baked mussels, fried amaebi heads,\u000asuper white tuna, hamachi belly, salmon, fresh scallop, ikura, and cajun albacore fill our table, and after a few minutes, empty plates. Mentioning that they also loved uni, shrimp tempura, and soft shell crab, I knew what to order for round four...\u000a\u000aRound 4-limited nigiri and rolls-uni, amaebi, tiger roll, pastel roll, hurricane roll, puffy roll, and spider hand rolls fill our table, only this time, all the plates weren't empty. One by one, they all tapped out, leaving some half rolls, a couple of spider hand rolls and a virtually untouched plate of "ocean butta"(uni), at least 20-25 more pieces. What started out as MMMMMM! ended up in " I'm full" or "I can't eat anymore, I'm so stuffed".....\u000a\u000aSeeing their pain, on the outside, I was like "Aw, thats too bad"  on the inside, I was like "YEAH BOYEEEEE!!!!! I could even hear Optimus Prime saying "Goyemonstah, TRANSFORM !!!" (( ***transforming sound*** ))\u000aone by one, plates were empty until all the sushi was gone..."Ready for dessert?" I asked. Our guests were too stuffed to even think about dessert and kindly declined.\u000aWifey got her usual chocolate mousse, and I finished with a green tea cake, strawberry mochi ice cream, and a lychee sherbet....Boy we sure slept well...at least I know I did!....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(140/365) "Unleash The Goyemonstah!!!"

VAs predicted, It was Jiro and his staff that made us do it....\u000a\u000aTempted our stomach and tastebuds with the finest sushi porn on the big screen,\u000aand like crack addicts, we just HAD TO get our sushi fix....Kabuto was a thought, but would be impossible, since we didn't have reservations(John Curtas probably hustled out of the theater and headed there)\u000a\u000aSushi Mon on Sahara, since its closer? Nah...\u000a\u000aKabuki? Nope, they're not AYCE...\u000a\u000aGo Wild? That's a negative....\u000a\u000aSo of course the logical thing, and everyone agreed, was to drive  to Goyemon. Why?\u000a\u000aStamp Card...Check!\u000aSpecal Nigiri Selections...Check!\u000aUNLIMITED Dessert Selections....Check!\u000aShoyu Ramen at 11pm....Check!\u000aALWAYS a great time with TEAM GOYEMON....Check!\u000a\u000aSo 5 of us sat up at the bar and our nigiri sushifest was taken care of by Hiro, Dimas, and Min. Even though they were slammed, they were still able to conversate and laugh with us! After countless nigiri, a bowl of ramen, and a mini dessert buffet, \u000awe were very content, thanked the staff for yet another great evening, and called it a night....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(254/365) "The REAL Duke is Back to ATTACK!"

VAfter giving Koma the benefit of the doubt, we came here for redemption. Sat up at the bar like we usually do, when its just me and Wifey, otherwise, we'd be in the Tatami Room....\u000a\u000awe start off with sides-One order each of Pork Belly, Spicy Tuna Rice Cracker, Baked Mussels and Fried Amaebi Heads...We receive TWO orders of each....\u000a\u000aWe order all the Nigiri Specials and the "one per person" items of the evening...we are surprised to find CONCH nigiri on our plate  when its not even the specials board...\u000a\u000aWe order up even more nigiri-Salmon, Scallops, Hamachi-Jalapeno with ponzu, Saba...we also find some fatty TORO on our plate, which is a special for the NEXT DAY...\u000a\u000aWaitstaff always promptly clear our plates, and keep our hot tea hot and full...\u000aHiro, Dimas, and Eddie always have time to chat even though it is busier than ever.(Can't say for the other chefs that work there, as we've always had the usual three serve us on our visits) Service gone downhill??? WATCHU TALKIN' BOUT WILLIS???\u000a\u000aHappy to find legs and claws sticking out of my Spider Handroll...not like that other spot where they chop it to sawdust...\u000a\u000aDessert time, and I order Lychee Sorbet, Green Tea Ice Cream, and a Strawberry Mochi. Why? Cause I can, and this is the only true AYCE spot. Everyone else in town gives you  hidden rules and the fine details which is straight up BS....2 HOURS later(What time limit? You have a time limit? Sucks to be you..:( ) Redemption indeed...\u000a\u000aCan't stand the wait times? Go elsewhere....those who have patience know what they're getting, and why there's a constant wait with this place...HMMM? Why are other\u000aplaces not as busy, and you can get in quicker??? I'll let you figure that one out yourself hot shot....\u000a\u000aTerrible service??? I haven't received any here since it opened....\u000a\u000aOver hyped??? I don't think so....other places are.\u000a\u000aGo for DINNER , and sit AT THE BAR are two suggestions I have, otherwise you're on your own...Still not satisfied? Good! stay at your favorite spot so that there will be just that much more space for me and my fellow Goyemonstahz....won't hurt our feelings!\u000a\u000aHate on Haters.....Hate on.....:P.......ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(54/100) "Public Sushi Announcement from Da Goyemonstah"

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(90/365) "Under ATTACK!!!!"\u000a\u000aWe were invited out to Goyemon's 3rd Annual Customer Appreciation night which I'm SO GLAD we chose to go on the first night because I hear they were wiped out of stuff and selections weren't as plentiful for the following night. We had reservations for 7pm but arrived at 6:30 and were seated pretty quickly. Then this newbie hostess proceeds to enforce the 1 hour time limit as if it was the Goyemonstah's first time here, so we say "Cool, no prob".....Yuki swings by and I check on the time limit to see if it starts when we place our order? or when our first order hits the table? He waves his hand, shakes his head, and I read his lips...."Don't worry about it".......:P  :\u000a\u000aYuki drops off our drinks and both Gio and Yuki tell us more good news. Aside from AYCE Uni, which is usually one order per person, they also have Toro and Kobe Beef which are AYCE as well, and Hamachi Kama returned  to the AYCE menu for the evening with Foie Gras Nigiri(one per person) Like a kid in a candy store, I was ready to KILL IT! People were eating rolls!?!? and not taking advantage of the specials board and the killer nigiri selection they were offering for the evening!?!? More for DA GOYEMONSTAH!!! Buahahahaha!!!! \u000a\u000aThe main focus was nigiri, so we eased up on our usual side orders(fried Amaebi Heads, Spicy Tuna Rice Crackers and Fried Calamari had to step aside) starting with a Grilled Pork Belly and a Hamachi Kama. plate after plate was cleaned a few minutes upon arrival, and after final tally, my hit list looked something like this:\u000aAYCE Nigiri, 2 per order:\u000a\u000aUni: X 8\u000aToro: X 8\u000aSaba: X 5\u000aScallop:X 3\u000aConch: X 3\u000aKobe Beef: X 5\u000aHamachi Belly with Jalapeno and Ponzu:X 5\u000aAmaebi: X 1\u000aFoie Gras: X 1\u000aSalmon Belly X 2\u000a\u000aGrilled Pork Belly: X 1\u000aGrilled Hamachi Kama: X 1\u000aTempura Ice CreamX1\u000aCheesecake X1\u000aYuzu SherbetX1\u000a\u000aWhat a grubfest it was, and I beat my old record(80) from 10 years ago by 2 more pieces! What was even sweeter is we had a filled stamp card. We thanked Yuki, Gio, and the rest of the Goyemon Boyz for yet another great evening, and I can't wait until next year's event!  ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  5\u000a\u000a*When you stick with the same people for 10 years, they treat you like Ohana....\u005cuuu/

DJ in the back with an open dance floor with no one dancing, old school games are off to one side and the more updated games are on the other side..it can get a little stuffy in here...probably not some place I'd return to.\u000a\u000aI actually prefer The Pinball Hall of Fame....ALOHA!!!

VI SERIOUSLY want to be a fan of Pan Asian, but on our two visits, it was just a mixed bag of things. Right now, its at 3 1/2 stars.\u000a\u000aOn our first visit, we started out with the Malaysian Roti, Grilled Tiger Shrimp and Mango Salad, Massaman Chicken Curry, and the Beef Pad-see-yew.\u000aWe also shared the Fried Ice Cream for dessert. All of our selections were suggested by David.\u000a\u000aRoti-Excellent flavors, and I actually prefer Pan Asian's version over Satay's...\u000a\u000aShrimp and Mango Salad-great balance of sweet, sour, salty, and spice\u000a\u000aMassaman Chicken Curry was good, but the sweet potatoes weren't sweet at all.\u000a\u000aBeef Pad-see-yew was excellent!\u000a\u000aFried Ice Cream was a big fail, especially if you deep fry desserts in the same oil as the gyoza, calamari, and shrimp spring rolls-big no-no!\u000a\u000aVisit #2\u000a\u000aWe Ordered the Roti again, and we were gonna try the Filet Mignon Pho, but David suggested we try the Shrimp Tom Yum as well as the Red Nah Noodles.\u000aI also ordered the Chicken Panang Curry.\u000a\u000aRoti-Bomb diggits as the first time...\u000a\u000aShrimp Tom Yum wasn't all that...flavors were off, overkill on the lime and fish sauce and the shrimp were borderline tough and rubbery.\u000a\u000aRed Nah-more sauce than noodles, I stick my fork in and pull out a "ball" of Rice noodles stuck together!?!?!..Really dissappointing...\u000a\u000aChicken Panang Curry- Excellent flavors, life-saving dish of the night...\u000a\u000aPossibly returning to give Pan Asian one more "make it, or break it" try..\u000aHopefully Lisa and David  redeem themselves this time...ALOHA!!!!

VWell, well, well WHADDAYOUKNOW!?!?! Its about time I give Pan Asian an update and an UPGRADE!\u000a\u000aI last reviewed Pan Asian a while back in July 2011 and we haven't been back since our less than stellar visit. We had Pan Asian recently at Vanessa's birthday bash, and the Green Papaya Salad, Pad-See-Yeew, and Shrimp and Basil Fried Rice were all quite tasty, and I thought "maybe there's that glimmer of hope for that fourth star after all?"\u000a\u000aWe stopped in for lunch recently and ordered up our favorites-Pad See Yeew and Chicken Panang Curry. Portions seemed to have gotten bigger, and the flavors were FANTABULOUS! We will most definitely be back once another Pan Asian craving hits.\u000aALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(69/100) "Four Star Bump"

VIt's raining men up in here! Never knew why this place was called The Garage until we stepped inside-Auto mechanic/Nascar/Grease monkey vibe, pool tables, shuffleboard, dart boards, and even an old school pac-man game is there!\u000a\u000aStaff were nice and friendly, making sure we were taken care of, and the first place I heard of where they have Unisex bathrooms!? Lovin' the music selection here as well, but the cramped space and the smoke I could do without.\u000a\u000aWe played a few rounds of darts which was fun, and the company we were with always ensures a great time.

VI seriously disagree with the three star average Los Jarochos has gotten...probably because the majority of these two star and below reviews are from two years ago.\u000a\u000aFast forward to 2013...we were in the mood for some tacos, and we have our favorite spots we frequent, but instead of hitting the streets, this time we decided to give Los Jarochos a try since we've driven by countless times and is also heavily favored by Duchess and fellow Yelper Alison Y.\u000a\u000aAs you step inside, the place is spacious, clean, and inviting. You have a wide selection of items-Tacos, Tortas, Burritos, Soups, Tostadas, Empanadas, and Combination Plates, the list goes on and on...Another good sign is the homemade agua frescas up front. Not out of a machine, or a nasty pre-made mix, and whats even sweeter about it? FREE REFILLS! Who does that???Los Jarochos does!\u000a\u000aWe decide from the plethora of items to go for some tacos and empanadas for our first visit. We ordered the Crab Empanada since it sounded good, and we decided to share a Tostada de Pollo. For our tacos, we each got Tripa(ask for it bien doradito, or crispy)and Borrego(lamb). You heard me right... Lamb Tacos? Who does that???Los Jarochos does!\u000a\u000aOut of all the items we ordered, everything was delicious, but the Crab Empanada was just blah...now what we expected.The tacos are about the size of El Gordos, and these are fresh tortillas, another plus which wil automatically make me a fan. I found a little piece of bone in my Lamb Taco, but that ain't gonna cause me to be critical and ding them a star. These were so good, we ordered up another round of Borrego and Tripas tacos and a Cheese Empanada. A little note on the empanadas here-these aren't your flaky dough, baked type of empanada, these are fresh masa filled goodies that "poof up" when dropped in the fryer, so the filling may not look plentiful, but is still a simple, straightforward treat. Overall, a great first visit, and we will be back for more!....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(43/100) "Lamb Tacos Sold Here...:9"

VWent to Fresh 52 at Tivoli Gardens for the opening weekend. There were only two little aisles of vendors, and at the far end, there was a crepe vendor and a  mini doughnut vendor.\u000a\u000aA Reggae band provided entertainment and there were quite a few shoppers sporting Yelp shopping bags\u000a\u000aHopefully this event brings in more vendors as time goes by. its a perfect venue to hold a farmers market, and one that I can attend since I have Saturdays off.....ALOHA!!!

VWe had about an hour before Paolo D.'s Foto Walk in Downtown, so we stopped by for a quick bite...The only other arepas we've tried was Gran Colombia(next to Pho 87) Colombian style arepas which were totally different in taste and presentation.\u000a\u000aAs always, we go with the chef's suggestions so we got the Reina Pepiada\u000aand the Carne Mechada. Everything here is made to order, so expect to wait awhile especially when more people find out about this place. Chef Felix takes each masa cake and splits it down the center creating a pocket like a pita and stuffs it with your desired filling.\u000a\u000aThe Reina Pepiada tasted basically like a cold chicken salad with bits of hot dog which were also cold. Maybe that's the way its supposed to be, but not one I would order again.\u000a\u000aThe Carne Mechada was served hot and a bit more flavorful-saucy shredded beef and peppers, this one was "messy good" as the chef suggested "step back and take a bite so you don't get it all over your shirt"\u000a\u000aThe Passionfruit drink was also refreshing too. Definitely coming back for some of his other selections...Tongue and Tripe? HELLS YEAH!?...ALOHA!!!

VOn our return visit, I tried  the tongue and tripe since they didn't have it on our previous visit...I really wanted to enjoy them, but the tripe still was way under seasoned and could not masque the "tripey"smell( ever smell a pot of simmering tripe?)\u000a\u000aThe tongue was soft but also underseasoned as well...I had to add more salt and some of the condiments on the counter to make it taste better...\u000a\u000aWhat was even more disappointing was the masa was tough and dried out from being REHEATED!?!?!? We could totally taste the difference from masa that is cooked to order-crisp outside and soft inside.....why fix something that ain't broken???\u000a\u000aOn par like Pan Asian with a 3-star review, I really want to give this place another shot...just hoping it won't turn into another disappointment...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(19/365) "Do I love Arepas???"

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(149/365) "How About a Pabellon Cachapa?"\u000a\u000aLong awaited update, and first time in the brick and mortar location. Glad to see that they offer more than just Arepas now, and are open 24 hours on weekends.\u000a\u000aPerusing the menu, a couple of things caught my attention-Pabellon, and Cachapa.\u000aToo bad they didn't have the two combined, because I've been searching for that killer combination after having it at Pica Pica Maize Kitchen in Napa.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pica-pica-napa-2?select=D2QDnqVaFYS7EpRd-4XTqQ#Eo2CTtCtgsNwu0ZAaFIeiQ\u000a\u000aHaving already tried a few of the Arepas, we ordered both the Cachapa and Pabellon to share as well as their tasty Soursop Drink. These were both pretty good, but I wished they would offer more ways to have the cachapa than just cheese.fillings, or even a pabellon cachapa? (hint, hint!) maybe like any of the arepas  The Arepas are okay, but I just am not much of a fan of that masa pocket that holds all the fillings together, kinda like a Mexican Gordita which I'm also not really a fan of.\u000a\u000aIf worse comes to worse, I might even just order a cachapa and ask them to add the meat and plantains inside and charge me extra...that is, if and when a craving hits, because we're almost always next door anyway!

VWe first went to Big Wong during their opening week and their "Dollar Dining Days". We tried the fried chicken and the curry with Roti. Both were good, but little did we know that we weren't ordering the right items!?!?!\u000a\u000afast forward to tonight.....after we bailed from Ellis Island, we ended up here with Judd and Lynn to try their house speciality, Shrimp Wonton Soup, so we each got a bowl. what began as a quest to try the Shrimp Wonton Soup ended up being the three best bowls of Soup/Noodles I've had in town.\u000a\u000aFirst for the shrimp wontons-clear broth, clean flavors, and the only place in town I know of that has ALL SHRIMP wontons, not combined with pork or any other fillers...WINNER!\u000a\u000aConnie and Wai have got to be some of the nicest business owners in town. Very humble, always open to suggestions, comments and concerns that we were all chatting about, which leads Wai to have us be the FIRST ONES to try one of two upcoming ramen dishes next month.\u000a\u000aFirst up, His Beef Ramen Bowl-Tender chunks of braised beef in a clean, flavorful broth over perfectly cooked ramen noodles**(THE PICTURE IS NOT THE USUAL SIZE....IT IS ABOUT 1 1/2 ORDERS SO WE ALL COULD SHARE SO NO ONE GETS CONFUSED)**ANOTHER WINNER!\u000a\u000aNext, Wai brings us the most flavorful Shrimp Broth you'll EVER taste!\u000aWe stir some ramen noodles in, and yet another WINNER! Powerful shrimp taste with just the right amount of spice.\u000a\u000aSeriously, if you really want a great bowl of ramen, forget Monta(yup, I said it) Wai knows what's up, and he stands by it 100%.\u000a\u000a\u000aA UYE by Judd and Lynn is coming up soon, complete with some new menu items and special promotions, so keep an eye out for it. Thank you Connie and Wai, for great food and hospitality, and also to Judd and Lynn for  the menu suggestions. We'll definitely be back...ALOHA!!!

VA few of us stopped in after the Elite event at PJ Clarke's, ready for some serious econo eats. I couldn't decide between the Ribeye Plate or Shrimp Wontons with Ramen, so I got 'em both, and they were hella good as always!\u000a\u000aConnie and Wai were hospitable as always, and were even nice enough to send out some fried shrimp wontons to our table. Good food and good times with good people....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(84/365) " Serious Econo Eats"

VBig Wong's Special Shrimp Soup with Wontons(ALL shrimp, no fillers) and Ramen Noodles has got to be the best bowl of soup and noodles available in Chinatown, possibly even in all of Las Vegas....flavorful broth and perfectly cooked ramen noodles each time I get it. Perfect, especially in this chilly weather!\u000a\u000aNo other bowl of noodles compare, IMHO.....Taiwan Deli? Nope. Pho Kim Long? Not even close. Monta? try again. Ichiza? No way. Haven't  tried Bejing Noodle Cafe yet, but Big Wong has my vote...\u000a\u000aEven more awesome is that Wai was nice enough to go ahead and SUPER SIZE our bowls, doubling up on everything!!!! Salt and Pepper Shrimp was perfection as well. Connie told us about the new Dessert Roti, and right away, we got two orders because neither of  us was gonna share our dessert!\u000a\u000aSoft, warm, and the perfect amount of sweetness with condensed milk drizzled on top with a light sprinkling of powdered sugar. a nice sweet ending to a meal. Even sweeter is that they are just a dollar each!\u000a\u000aThanks again Connie and  Wai for such great food, and even greater hospitality.....ALOHA!!!

VStopped here while browsing at Fresh 52 and decided to get a bite to eat...We shared the Leone Breakfast which was a deconstructed  looking plate of savory and sweet items that didn't seem to flow together.\u000a\u000aTo be honest, the White Chocolate Batard from the Bon Breads tent was a better breakfast option...so good, that after nibbling about half of the loaf, we went back to get another one to enjoy at home...ALOHA!!!

VI may have just found one of my favorite rice plates here in town, and in my neck of the woods!\u000a\u000aWe tried their Combination Pho, House Special Roast Chicken and BBQ Pork Banh Mi.\u000aThe Pho broth was a little too sweet for my liking, but the Roast Chicken Leg and the Banh Mi were so good, I would return for those two items. I was also able to enter the PLUOY photo contest with a sticker that was on their front door, and was able to come in 2nd out of all the entries! Not bad considering I did little to no campagning!\u000a(See My Profile picture...:),\u000a\u000a\u000aI finished off with an avocado boba and wifey tried their 3 color drink which were both disappointing. Wouldn't susggest those.... We will return for the rice plates and banh mi!...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(329/365) "Go For The Food, Not the Drinks"

This is one more of Vegas' hidden gems...equipped with free pool table, shuffleboard, and arcade games mixed with very eclectic furniture, lighting, and artwork, the lounge area made me feel like I was back in Cancun at one of their all-inclusive "party resorts."\u000a\u000aSpeaking of resorts, If you plan to visit, the sign outside says Royal RESORT, not house....hope this bit of advice will save you from driving around in circles. The staff here are very laid back and friendly, always seeing that the guests who enter here are well taken care of.\u000a\u000aIts also a good spot for people watching-a good mix of people pass through here...out-of-towners, family vacationers, douchebags, yelpers, hoochie mamas, and on August 31st, there well be hella NERDS up in here!!!ALOHA!!!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(14/365) "The Vegas you never knew about..."

VI love the fact that  you don't have to worry about second hand smoke while having a meal in most restaurants around town.\u000a\u000aAs for the smoke that is coming from LVG's huge in-house smoker, it doesn't bother me at all! It actually adds to your dining experience. We were on our way to see Carlos Mencia, So we made plans to stop in for dinner.\u000a\u000aWe decided to share the 4 meat and 3 sides combo. For our meats, we chose Beef Sirloin, Thai Green Chili Sausage, BBQ Ribs, and Bobby Y.'s highly recommended\u000aRoast Chicken with Pineapple Jerk Sauce. We got the Roasted Potatoes, Pasta Salad, and Braised Red Cabbage for our sides.\u000a\u000aIt was cool because we practically had the whole restaurant to ourselves with only one other diner. Phil came out to greet us, and was happy we found out about LVG through\u000aYELP, went over the different woods they use, and the different applications for all the meats.\u000a\u000aOur meal arrives, and everything looks awesome. I take a bite of the sirloin and wow!\u000asmokey, juicy, yummy goodness! The Thai sausage had a very nice heat and the fish sauce and lemongrass was also evident. Phil thought that the sausage was on the small side, so he brought us another one-OH YEAH! The Ribs........The .......................................................................................................................................................................................................OOPS! got side tracked thinking of the fall-off-the-bone goodness!!! Where was I? Oh, I took one bite and the rest of the rib fell clean off the bone-ABSOLUTE PERFECTION!  The chicken? I didn't put that bad boy down until it was all bones! all the sides complemented the meats so well, and we'll definitely take Phil's suggestion and come back to try the wings, and I'll be having a rack of ribs and a bucket of Pineapple Crack Sauce on the side!....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(206/365) "Awesome Second Hand Smoke"

VFor any serious Jerkyterian, The Jerky outlet is right up your alley. Aside from the usual beef, they also have turkey, and more exotic meats like aligator, elk, buffalo, venison, and kangaroo...\u000a\u000aCan't decide which one(s) to get? No worries, they have a sample table of all the jerky varieties...I've had buffalo, elk, aligator and venison before and they all tasted good. No, the Aligator does not taste like chicken, more like a fish jerky IMO...Kangaroo was something I haven't tried, but after tasting it, I liked it best out of all the samples.\u000aAll the jerky comes in different preparations too. From soft and chewy, to firm and tug-of-war hard, from sweet to smoky and peppery. They come packaged in various sizes, and you can also buy in bulk as well.\u000a\u000aNot a meat eater? they also carry popcorn treats and some VERY ADDICTING deep fried peanuts where you can just pop 'em in your mouth shells and all, believe me, one bag ain't enough...these also come in sweet and savory flavors. They also sell gift baskets and wacky shirts as well, like their PETA shirt-(People Eating Tasty Animals)\u000a\u000aStop in the next time you're in the area, and for locals, don't forget to grab a 10% off your next purchase coupon on your way out...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(152/365) "Better Than a Slim Jim"

VWe had some time to kill before going up to the pool to see Enrique Iglesias in concert.\u000a\u000aThis was an interactive exhibit where we constructed our own artistic pieces out of random pieces of plastic, wood, glass, wire, and fabric then tested\u000aour pieces' movement with the addition of the soundwaves of music.\u000a\u000aAlthough I had a piece that was structurally sound, it was too heavy to move with the music.

VI was able to score some VIP tickets at a recent Elite event, so I couldn't wait to attend, being that it was in its third year running, and the two previous years had sold out.\u000a\u000aWe got to try brews of all kinds, and even drop by the Yelp tent for some DIY pretzel necklaces. Of all the brews sampled, I loved the Shock Top Apple Brew, Blue Moon's Cranberry Brew, and Joseph James' special hourly limited Taps. One thing that also helped this 92 degree day were the mist machines and water stations set up within the venue. Those cooling stations were great!\u000a\u000aThe VIP section was pretty cool as well. We got to sip on special brews from Khoury's, and nosh on some Short rib tacos, mac and cheese, and chipotle-cheddar sausages-YUM!\u000a\u000aI just don't get the constant bitching and moaning other reviews mention- parking, long lines, hot weather, out of a certain brew, no rinse stations, etc...Everyone's coming out for the same reason you are, so if you don't plan accordingly or didn't go over the Festivals' website to know what's going on to make your experience a good one, that's on YOU....I got a good solution for y'all next year......STAY HOME!!!!....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(94/100) "Mahalo Motley Brews!"

VCame out to Boulder City to feast on some finger lickin' BBQ.\u000a\u000aWe walked around to see (and smell) what the vendors and competitors were offering...we ended up buying some Kansas City Style BBQ from Montana BBQ Company and some Local style BBQ from Ozark Mountains BBQ\u000a\u000aMontana BBQ Company's Ribs were good, but Ozark Mountain's was left in the smoker a bit too long which ended up being a dry, over-smoked rib...\u000a\u000aOverall, this wasn't as great as we anticipated it would be....Lucile's is just as good, if not,better...ALOHA!!!

VSo we finally made the trip for lunch for some pulled noodle action and we went straight for the noodle section and ordered up the Szechuan Eggplant with Noodles and the very popular Lan Zhou Beef Noodle Soup. We also got the Veggie Pancake as a starter.\u000a\u000aWe inquired about when they usually put on the "noodle show", and the chef's wife said they don't do it in the dining room anymore, just in the kitchen...bummer!\u000a\u000aThe Veggie Pancake comes out first and was so tasty- hot, crispy, and not greasy tasting at all, even better with the soy dipping sauce and the house made chili oil!\u000aNext, The Eggplant comes out, and there's a complete silence at our table with the exceeption of slurping sounds...The noodles are just as great as all of Yelp land says they are, and the slight char and sweetness of the eggplant just rounds it out so perfectly. Finally, the Lan Zhou Beef Noodle Soup arrives. As we dig in, we both take a sip of the broth, and we both get coughing spells(water....quick!!!) we try  the noodles, and they are very good but can't get past the overkill on the star anise and the intense blend of secret spices. I take another spoonful of broth....Coughing spell #2(another glass of water!) maybe its supposed to taste that way, and that's the way its made, but we both preferred our eggplant dish over the noodle soup.\u000a\u000aWe'll be back to try their other noodle dishes for sure..ALOHA!!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(118/365) "Oodles of Noodles"

VBig crowd+Huge carousel of Al Pastor=Gotta check this place out!\u000a\u000aHeading out from the 51's game at Cashman Field, we were searching for a quick bite . Located on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd. and E. Bonanza, Tacos El Pastorcito has been serving up tacos on this street corner for just about two months.\u000a\u000aThey offer the usual meats-Asada, Lengua, Cabeza, Chorizo, and the fan favorite, Al Pastor.\u000a\u000aThe service/pick-up is pretty simple:\u000a-How many tacos you want\u000a-The type of meats you want on them(ask for the diced pineapple with the Al Pastor)\u000a-The guys quickly get your meat selections and tortillas give them a few seconds on the flat top grill, and hand you your undressed tacos.\u000a-Off to the right side is a condiment bar with all the fixins to dress your taco up to your liking-3 salsas, onions, cilantro, limes, radishes, the works...\u000aOff to the left side, you pay the damage for our tacos, and don't forget  some homemade horchata to compliment your tacos. At $1.50 a taco($2 for Lengua)\u000aand horchata for a buck, this is some econo eats, but SERIOUS street food definitely worth returning for, and somehow tastes better eating it on the streets.\u000a\u000aThey also have Quesadillas, Burritos and other specialities, but definitely do not pass up the Al Pastor.....just as tasty as El Gordo's Al Pastor... CASH ONLY...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000a**FYI...Hours of operation 11am(I think he said am???)-3am Thursday-Sunday, Closed,Mon.-Wed.... call in before you plan to stop by...(702)325-4020 or(702)306-5910

Compaired to Taqueria El Pastorcito, its a toss-up...they both are equally good.\u000a\u000aAgain, we see funny names on their menu, so we go ahead and try a Gringa, a medium sized flour tortilla with melted cheese, al .pastor, pineapple, and avocado ($5) which kinda looks like an al pastor pizza. That's also delicious, especially for those who love flour tortillas.\u000a\u000aStill only at 3 reviews!?!?!?!? Y'all are missing out!!!\u000a\u000aPROS\u000a\u000aQuick, efficient service\u000a\u000aBilingual staff\u000a\u000aThese Al Pastor Tacos kick the s@#t out of El Gordo's too\u000a\u000a\u000aCONS\u000a\u000anone I can think of...\u000a\u000a\u000a**RECOMMENDATIONS**\u000a\u000aAl Pastor Tacos\u000a\u000aGringa\u000a\u000aHorchata from scratch (when available)\u000a\u000aALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(168/365) "Street Taco Scramble Part 4"

VHaven't been to the salon yet, but having read the highly rated Yelp reviews and hearing great things about Chef Sheridan, his wife Jenny, we immediately booked spots\u000afor Great Bao Asian Cafe's Pop-up restaurant/dinner, Hawk'r.\u000a\u000aThis sold out event held at Bread and Butter featured a six- course meal provided by Chef Su. My favorites of the evening was the Hamachi course as well as the popular Great Bao. Overall,  great concept, but kinda left me expecting a little more. Looking forward to trying more of  Chef Su's creations in the future. +1 star for the huge bag of Red Velvet Bagels Chris gave us on the way out!....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(134/365) "Poppin' Up at Bread and Butter"

VPick Your Poison still has my vote for the best cupcakes  in town. They were part of the Las Vegas Chocolate and Pastry Festival, and as always, they did not disappoint.\u000a\u000aThey had a couple of new flavors I haven't tried before, the Banana Cream Pie and Spiked Arnold Palmer which were both awesome, and I was hooked on a couple of other items-the Get Loopy Cakepop which was their grape soda cake dipped in white chocolate and coated in fruity pebbles, and what was called Not Yo Momma's Pudding-alcohol infused chocolate and vanilla pudding with crushed oreo and cookies and cream candy bar, that was totally addicting!\u000a\u000aDefinitely a must have when you're in Vegas...You won't be disappointed...\u000a\u000aThanks again ladies!

VParents, if you have kids that throw temper tantrums because they want a particuar toy, and they want it NOW, don't bring them here. this store is geared for the serious collector. For people who grew up during the 60's through the 90's, you'll be familiar with the majority of stuff here- Barbie, diecast cars, Star Wars, Transformers, GI JOE, Masters of the Universe, Marvel Superheroes, LOTR, McFarlane, Simpsons, and many, many more...\u000a\u000aa few of these items doubled, tripled, or more in price over time due to their popularity,\u000aso be prepared to pay or try your luck to make an offer, if you are looking to purchase something here. My favorites here are the vintage Transformers and Star Wars sections. Growing up in Hawaii, I'm also a fan of Japanese Superheroes plastic vinyl and diecast figures(Kikaida, Gorangers, Rainbowman, Kamen Rider, Zaboga, Ultraman, etc. but sadly nothing like that found here. The Shogun Warriors Godzilla was pretty cool though. \u000a\u000aI'll continue to pop in every once in a while, because its all about the thrill of the hunt, and I may find something to add to my action figure collection...ALOHA!!!

V28GO is a reference to the manga series from the 50's, Tetsujin 28 Go(Iron Man #28) and was the first Japanese series to feature a giant robot.\u000a\u000aOther robots that have followed later over the years: The Great Mazinger, Robotech, and Voltron images  all decorate the interior of the restaurant and adds to its cool look.\u000aMenu items come on a mini clip board which is a first I've seen.\u000a\u000aLike Guy C. had mentioned, the bathroom signs kinda threw me off, so I just went into the first door with the anime chick on the wall...the other room was dark...oh well.\u000a\u000aThe manager Xalan was very welcoming and answered any questions we had about menu items. We decided to share The Gogi Stuffed Waffle and the Mixed Seafood Kimchee Ramen. The stuffed waffle is a cool concept, but fell a little short. I like waffles with a crisp exterior and very soft inside like they do at Waffles Cafe. 28GO's version are thinner with a spongy texture and the flavors were okay.\u000a\u000aThe Ramen was slightly underseasoned but a bit better, and my bowl was piping hot from beginning to end so I had no issues with temperature like other reviews mention.\u000aAll of the mixed seafood, especially the mussels were also cooked properly which was good. The Cream Fizz was also a good compliment to our meal.\u000a\u000aI'd like to give 28GO another visit and try their tapas items which sound very tempting as well. We shall see.....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(216/365) " Fusion Food and Robots"

VWhen a Japanese restaurant totally makes me feel like I'm not in Las Vegas, I'm totally a fan, as with my other favorite Japanese spots in town (Ichiza, I-Naba, and Kabuto)\u000a\u000aWe finally made it here, and for our first visit, we were very pleased! We started out with the Karaage and one of the specials that caught my attention: Grilled Chicken Hearts. These were prepared with a soy based glaze which had a nice chewy texture like gizzards and served over a bed of greens which had a sweet vinaigrette. I liked the hearts better than the Karaage which I thought was just okay.\u000a\u000aI've been a huge fan of Japanese style Curry ever since visiting Japan back in my college years, and loved going to the curry houses (and Ramen houses, and Katsu houses, etc.) They have a spicy version here at CDJ, and I didn't mind, since I had my mind set on the Katsu Curry. The Katsu was good, but not as juicy as I would have liked,\u000abut I loved the curry, rice, and the pickled vegetables accompanying the dish. The spice level gave me the sniffles but we had the totally refreshing Yuzu Soda to help calm the heatwave.\u000a\u000a We ended our meal with an iced siphon coffee which was HELLA STRONG, and a Yaki Imo(sweet potato) Cake which came with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, chocolate sauce, and almonds. It was okay, but not something I'd order again. I do look forward to visiting again to try more of their savory items....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(286/ 365) "Curry with a KICK!"

VCool place to relax and more family oriented. Not the place to come if you're one of those types who wanna "see and be seen" like those cesspools of nastiness at the better known pools (Rehab, Wet Republic, etc) which is totally fine with me!\u000a\u000aPool Attendants were great, always checking up if we needed anything, and totally took care of us throughout the day.\u000a\u000aOnly one pool and a hot tub there, but there are a lot of loungers and ample shaded areas. Hours are 9am-5pm with a $5 cover for locals on Weekends, pool attendant didn't charge us though, and towels are also provided. Water bottles are allowed and their drinks were okay as was their pizza which was from inside the food court.\u000a\u000aLooking for a place to unwind without the party scene? Check this place out...ALOHA!!!

VIts a great location for some dim sum action. Spacious, not too crowded, and you don't have to deal with rude chinese customers here like you do at Gold Coast, Cathay House, Etc.\u000a\u000aThey have a pretty good variety here, and all of the dim sum we got was piping hot. Another bonus is their mini manapuas and rice cakes...a little taste of home! Its a great alternative for locals who live in the area, and also for those who don't usually hit up Chinatown.\u000a\u000aStop in the next time you're in the area and want something other than your usual burger, pizza, or salad...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(313/365) "Get Sum Dim Sum !"

VI've been to this venue for a couple of concerts during the Hawaiian Festivals(Rebel Souljahz and Kapena) but this time it wasn't for a concert, but for Zumbathon-Lucky Zumba 2012. We were not only getting a kick-ass workout for 2 hours straight, but we were also there for a good cause, helping out three square as well. The cost for admission was 5 canned vegetable items per person.\u000a\u000aAfter the DROP Studios ladies had us sign waivers, took our canned goods and handed us our Lucky Zumba bracelets, we headed inside. DJ ROB was providing the rockin' beats for the evening, and didn't have any boring song selections during the whole time like some Zumba classes can.\u000aThe "Cream of the Crop" top Zumba Instructors in Vegas orchestrated this Zumbathon and it was High Energy all the way. One of the familiar faces was Jackie. Some of us may remember her from the Yelp Olympics, and she also teaches Zumba classes at LVAC. Surprisingly, no other LVAC instructors represented(Where was Olga and Joe D.???) The other instructors-Enrique, Teddy, Maria, Megan, and the buff G.I. Joe dude(forgot his name) were from 24 Hour Fitness(at least I think so)\u000a\u000aParticipants and instructors came dressed wearing green for St. Patrick's Day and some even got very creative with their wardrobe even sporting green facial hair!\u000aThe Zumbathon was broken into high powered segments between instructors so participants could rehydrate and also win raffle items from Staycations and dinners at Silverton, Chippendales and Thunder from Down Under Tickets, Botox Treatments, and the participant that dressed up the "Most St. Patrick's Day" won a pot  full of Zumba clothing and accessories.\u000a\u000aWhat a workout it was! after the first hour, a few that couldn't hang had already bailed, and the party went on for the 21 and over crowd as there were also cocktails being offered for  those who decided to drink !?!?!?! The last segment was in honor of St. Patrick's Day which included a traditional Irish Jig, a blast from the past with House of Pain's "Jump Around", then DJ ROB went FURTHER BACK and we all ended the Zumbathon with "Come On Eileen" from Dexy's Midnight Runners! Finally, a cool-down with "Bruddah Iz", Isreal Kamakawiwoole's "What A Wonderful World" ended the night's festivities. With close to 1,000 participants, well over 4000 pounds of canned goods were recieved and our mission was definitely accomplished.....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(199/365) "ZUMBATHON 2012"

I scored a sweet cookbook to add to my library on this visit.\u000a\u000aAnother bonus is that its connected to TJ Maxx, so you can also get tour shop on there as well. Hungry? Glazier's, Island Flavor, and Suzuya are all close by, and great food options on the Southwest side...ALOHA!!!

VChris Herrin and I have a few things in common-\u000a\u000aWe're both in the food biz....\u000a\u000aWe've both worked for one of the best chefs IN THE WORLD, Thomas Keller\u000a\u000aWe're both Bouchon alumni (Chris/Vegas, Me/Napa Valley)\u000a\u000aLast but not least, we're both ROOT BEER addicts!!!!\u000a\u000aWe decided to "kill two birds with one stone" and check out Chris' latest venture, and this place was jumpin! The smells of the food and baked goods coming out of the kitchen combined with the cozy inviting atmosphere made you feel like you were in a restaurant in the Napa Valley,(at least that was the instant vibe that we got)\u000a\u000aBreakfast is my absolute favorite meal of the day, and Bread and Butter has instantly been included in our go-to places to break that fast!\u000aThe counter and showcase are filled with assorted Breads, baked goods, and pastries, there is a table where you can sample the homemade breads and jams,\u000aand the breakfast items served here are unique as well. One cool thing that also caught  my eye was Chris' assorted root beer section. labels from all over the country, well over 20 kinds!\u000a\u000aSo we settle for a Veggie Breakfast Pizza as well as the very much talked about Red Velvet Bagel. As I'm heading to our table, Chris opens up a bottle and hands it to me...\u000a"Here, you gotta try this one, we can hardly keep it in stock"....Gray's Gourmet Root Beer from Wisconsin is what he's talking about, and that is one kick-ass root beer!\u000a\u000aSo our pizza and bagel arrive, and our waitress says "These are compliments of the Chef"...not the pizza and bagel, but the assortment of pastries on top of our breakfast order!\u000a\u000aThe bagel was pretty good, but we loved everything on the pizza from the crust to the goat cheese, and assorted veggies topped with soft scrambled eggs-winner! The pizza and bagel were pretty filling, but we just HAD TO have a little bite of each pastry and we packed up the rest to enjoy at home.\u000a\u000aPumpkin Cake-Moist, flavorful, and not overly sweet\u000aHostess Cupcake-Better than the original!\u000aCheese Danish-very good with a hint of citrus\u000aApple Tart-Apples poached in Pomegranite juice with frangipane filling on sweet dough-one of my favorites\u000aPB & J Brioche-Need I say more???\u000a\u000aCongrats Chris!!! we'll most definitely be back....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(99/365) "Pan y Mantequilla"

VBack again (so soon???...NAH!) for some much needed nourishment after the Santa Run, I wanted to feast on a few of Chris' other offerings. We started off with the Steel Cut Oats which was very tasty, and had a great chewy texture.\u000a\u000aI also attacked the Ham and Cheese Waffle Sandwich with Rosemary Bechamel. Hearty, filling, a totally something you should order if you haven't had it yet...ALOHA!!!

VStopped in for breakfast again, and this time I was excited to see that Chris has added a few Hawaiian touches to his selection of sweets- Guava Cake, Coco Puffs, a la Liliha Bakery, and.......MALASSADAS!!!!!!! 2 plates mounded up high, and I'm eager to get to the front to place my order for a taste of home BUT there is just one problem.....\u000a\u000aThere is a Hawaiian family in front me......Are they just about to do what I think they're going to do???? Yup, THEY BOUGHT ALL TWO PLATES!!!!!! Sucks for me :(\u000aas I'm watching each piece being boxed up, I sadly place our breakfast order of Steel Cut Oats and a Veggie Breakfast Pizza. As I'm paying for breakfast, I hear Chris say "Fire up  more Malassadas!" Boy did my frown turn upside down! :) I  add 2 malassadas to our order($2 each or 2/$3) and return to our table with some coffee. A few minutes later, The other chef drops by our table. "This is compliments of Chris." A nice looking Malassada straight out of the fryer and filled with a gooey vanilla cream. Wifey takes a bite....BIG smile! I take a bite, and believe me, I grew up on Leonard's Malassadas...although a bit firmer in texture, the flavor is pretty darn close to the real deal. Not even Island Sushi's malassadas come close in flavor IMO...\u000a\u000aSo we finished up our breakfast, thanked Chris, and I was VERY tempted to get malassadas to go, but deided not to because the only way to really enjoy these bad boys is before they get too cold. Now I know I can get my malassada fix here!....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(159/365) "The Next Best Thing to Leonard's"

VOne of our breakfast spots that are in rotation, Terri K. was in town and planned a UYE brunch at B&B, So a bunch of us came out, ordered up some tasty treats and as always,\u000ahad a great time!\u000a\u000aWifey and I shared the Steel Cut Oats and The Breakfast Burrito. The oats were a little on the runny side, but still good, and the burrito was nice and hearty, possibly wifey's new favorite. The servers and staff were always on top of things, from seeing that we got our orders correctly, coffee and water refills, and Chris was even nice enough to send out a plate of his killer chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin cookies. As if that wasn't enough, we even get to try the soon-to-be-extinct Dublin Dr. Pepper!(Production of this formula using sugar instead of HFC stopped as of Jan. 2012) Get 'em while they last!\u000a\u000aFrom a hilarious knock-knock joke, getting introduced to DrawSomething, playing the Ukulele, the quirky analysts at The Cosmo, the stuck up service at Weiss, and juicing,\u000awe most definitely enjoyed the shit out of our morning!.......ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(198/365) "Brunch with the Yelperazzi"

VGreat food at very good prices, we stopped in for a quick bite and wifey ordered a Tofu Pad-See-Ewe and I got the Chicken Ga Pow cause I love any Thai dish thats got Thai Basil in it. Pair that with a fried egg on top??? Come on now!!!\u000a\u000aThe Pad-See-Ewe had the right balance of flavors and the noodles were nice and chewy...Great Dish! Luckily for me, I ordered the Ga Pow with a heat level of #2. I can take some heat, but you never know with the Thai number system....2 splashes, 2 pinches, 2 spoons??? First bite of my Ga Pow was like PA-POW!!! Great Flavors, nice heat, and not too overbearing. I'd order it again, but I'd need to super-size it cause I'm the Notorious P.I.G.....Nah, jus' Jokin!\u000a\u000aYou can see the kitchen in action through the window, and I couldn't  help but think...."What do they use that bottle of Nutella for!?!?!?"....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(109/365) "Sticky Rice and Nutella!?!?!?"

VSasapops is the SHIZZZZZ!!!!!\u000a\u000aYou can really taste the quality of ingredients in each pop, and at $4 each, they seem pricey, but I'm telling you, it is love at first bite!\u000aWe came across their stand while walking to First Friday, and wifey had tried Sasapops at an earlier Yelp gathering at Whole Foods and insisted we get some and I'm glad we did!\u000a\u000aWe both shared the Blueberry Cheesecake, a cheesecake pop studded with fresh blueberries and graham cracker crust chunks in the center, and the Salted Peanut-Caramel, a salted caramel pop with a salted peanut caramel center. Both were very creamy and silky smooth, and full of flavor with every bite.\u000a\u000aIf you haven't tried Sasapops yet, you don't know what you're missing!....ALOHA!!!!

VTrucks from Las Vegas, LA, San Francisco, and Denver came out to The South Point Casino for the first annual Gourmet Food Truck Festival.\u000a\u000aOur plan was to try all of the non-local trucks(LudoTruck, Chairman Bao, Biker Jim's Dogs, Nom Nom, Longboards Vintage Ice Cream Bars, and Coolhaus Ice Cream Sandwiches) We got there early, scoped out all the trucks and their offerings, and even talked with some of the truck owners and the organizers of this awesome event. There was a little "curveball" to the vendors in the fact that they weren't going to be selling beverages off their trucks, so that South Point could provide the beverage options and capitalize on this event. Nevertheless, it seemed to be a successful event, and hopefully will become an ongoing one. We came, we saw, and we accomplished our mission.\u000a\u000aHere's a little recap of events and observations;\u000a\u000a-LudoTruck's Provencal Chicken Combo was the best thing there, IMHO\u000a\u000a-Loved the Tofu, Pork Belly, and Duck Confit Bao from Chairman Bao\u000a\u000a-Biker Jim's off-the-menu Reindeer Dog was the one to get, with cream cheese, caramelized onions, and Horseradish Sauce, a winner as well\u000a\u000a-Nom Nom achieved celeb status from the Food Network's Great Food Truck Race and had the longest line and wait time, but it was just a good tasting Banh Mi....There are a few Banh Mi places here as well(Dakao, Hue Thai, Mr. Sandwich,etc that are just as good.\u000a\u000aLoved the Maple Cookie and Thai Iced Tea Ice Cream Sandwich with the EDIBLE PAPER we shared from Coolhaus\u000a\u000aLoved our custom dipped ice cream bars from Longboards to end our food truck feast.\u000a\u000aFukuburger was a no-show...Haute Chix is a cool concept, but they didn't seem to be generating any business...I wish that local trucks Lulu's, Top Notch, Haulin' Balls and Snow Ono joined the festivities....Miss Sloppi Jo's too, but Jolene was seen getting a taste at LudoTruck.\u000a\u000aOverall, a good event, and I hope this happens again next year...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(71/365) "West Coast Food Truck Collabo"

VBack for another round, The South Point Gourmet Food Truck Festival was in town again, this time with a few more additional trucks.Got there at about 6:30pm, and met up with a few yelpers and we browsed the trucks before we began our food truck grubfest.\u000a\u000aSome of these trucks, I wouldn't stand in line for because........\u000a\u000aChi-Town Hustler(Chicago Dogs, Chi-Town inspired Food)=Chicago Tasty Dogs\u000a\u000aCalbi=KoMex\u000a\u000aNom Nom=Dakao/Mr.Sandwich\u000a\u000aTornadoPotato=Get these at fairs and festivals....c'mon now!?!?!?\u000a\u000aSin City Wings=Buffalo Wild Wings\u000a\u000aRolling Sushi= Goyemon\u000a\u000aSo we hit up BBQ Boy first, and got hiz Sizzling Sisig since he didn't have it last time....\u000aI liked it but wifey didn't care for it because it didn't taste like the first time she had it...Props to Guy C. for trying it !!!!\u000a\u000aRan into Ric G.(Slidin' Thru) and he suggested the Pie and Burger Truck so we put that on our agenda, so I hit up Ludotruck next, and wifey got some Ichi-mas wings....A bit of bad news.....NO PROVENCAL CHICKEN!?!?!? Why wouldn't you serve the best thing at the festival again???? Ludo, it's SABOTAGE eh????(what he says when he thinks someone's trying to mess with him or his food on his show, Ludo Bites America) totally bummin' but I opted for the Chicken Sandwich with Bearnaise and Cole Slaw which was pretty tasty. Wings from Ichi-mas....meh, Big Wong's version is tons better.\u000a\u000aWifey got Pie and Burger's $10 Combo-Cheesebuger, fries, and a Boysenberry Pie..\u000aThe burger was simple, straightforward, and with a very old-school, no frills deliciousness, one of the best bites of our evening. I ended our savory food fest with a Biker Jim Reindeer Sausage with Caramelized Onions and Cream Cheese and it was just as awesome as the last time.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, we got a customized sandwich of Peanut Butter Cookie with a Brown Butter Maple Bacon Ice Cream which was freakin' amazeballs, but no edible paper this time!?!?!\u000a\u000aFinally, we hit up Longboards where I got a Coconut Bar dipped in milk chocolate and coated in Fruity Pebbles and potato chips which was totally grub....Hope this event keeps going stong, and Ludotruck, please bring your Provencal Chicken back, because its the MERDE!!!!!!.....ALOHA!!!!!\u000a\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(162/365) "What The Truck!?!?!?!?"

VI like a good piece of meat every once in a while, but man this place is MEAT OVERLOAD!!! The Gauchos that work here are really Brazilians from Brazil that cook and serve you generous portions of the 15 types of meat here. a bunch of us decided to take advantage of the Yelp Spring Break offer and dine in for $37.\u000a\u000aThere are many great items available at their salad bar, but you want to be very careful and not fill up on these items, because the meats and sides are where its at.\u000amy favorite meats were the Bone-in Lamb Chop and the Pichana. The sides(Potatoes, Polenta, and Plantains) were a perfect compliment to the well seasoned meats, and the Cheese Bread? Totally addicting!\u000a\u000aThe color cards....you're gonna have to play "Red Light, Green Light" with these Gauchos because if you just leave it green side up, they will bombard you with their meat rods like teeny-bopper girls trying to get Justin Bieber's autograph! Just Sayin'.......ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(271/365) " A Carniwhore's Heaven!"

VStopped in to see what all the hype was about...\u000a\u000aWe decided on getting half a dozen oysters and  2 pounds of shrimp with  their shabang sauce.\u000a\u000aoysters tasted watered down and lacked the briny flavor that I like in an oyster\u000aand I love Dungeness Crab, but for $14.99, you can get TWO out of a tank at 168 Market which is a much better deal IMO....Honestly, the shrimp didn't taste any different from what they serve up at their "competitors'" place.....\u000a\u000a+1 star though for being able to tag up the place with my magnum sharpie without having to look out for the po-po.....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 Challenge-(90/365) "Got Crabs???"

VThis was only my second time here, and wifey has never been, so we returned here after the Jabbawockeez Elite event. Tony T. had already secured a table for 8, and TNY was celebrating their 2nd Year Anniversary by offering 50% off two of their signature pastas-Uni Tomato Cream Pasta, and Squid Ink Spaghetti, so we met up with Teri C., Reggie M., Tony T., Professional competitive eater Miki "Mikachu" Sudo(who was Tony's +1) and Regina and Earl C.\u000a\u000aIt was PACKED when we got there, but we already knew what we were coming for.\u000aPretty much our whole table got the Uni Pasta(or two) and shared the Squid Ink Spaghetti on top of our orders. Miki opted for the Miso Carbonara, and Tony killed a few apps before his two bowls of Uni Pasta. Our wait time was pretty long, and we had been warned by our waitress, but our party didn't mind, as we filled the time chit-chatting, catching up with one another, and hearing about Miki's food challenges where she beat Joey Chestnut in a Wing Bowl Challenge, and beat Sonya"The Black Widow" Thomas in a Kimchi Challenge by killing 8.5 pounds in 6 minutes! Phozilla Challenge @ Pho 87 and The Quadruple Bypass Challenge @ Heart Attack Grill? She's been there, killed that...CRAZY!!!\u000a\u000aOur food finally arrives, and man, the Uni Tomato Cream Pasta did not disappoint!\u000aPerfect al dente on the pasta, the richness of the uni tomato cream, nice sweet chunks of uni, the chili threads and the torn pieces of basil helped balanced this dish out perfectly. Man, was that DEE-LISH!!! The Squid Ink Spaghetti came next, and this was also good...pasta and squid cooked to perfection with a hint of garlic, but it still seemed to be missing something, or the uni pasta was just too good to be overshadowed by anything else.\u000a\u000aI would return, BUT if I can find me some chili threads, I could duplicate this killer dish at home...ALOHA!!!

VThis Year, Redneck Kitchen was servin' up their tasty grub in the VIP Tent which knda hid them from public view.\u000a\u000aOn Friday Night, They served up a Meatloaf Spring Roll with two sauces, a ketchup-mayo one, and some kinda gravy based one. The crisp outer texture was nice, and the meatloaf inside was well seasoned.\u000a\u000aOn Saturday night, We got to try their Deep Fried PB & J Sammies which was pretty grub-not too greasy and not overly sweet either. The batter also had a nice crunch to it without being soggy which was great. Looking forward to trying other creations in the future.....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(92/100) "Upscale Redneck Grub"

VGiovanni Mauro is a man with passion for his pizza, and you know Las Vegas is very fortunate to have him when he has followers from New York, Philly, and California wishing that he was closer to them....If you read the other reviews, I'm just the second Yelp Las Vegas reviewer....\u000a\u000aI am pretty sure many of you have already tasted Chef Gio's cooking already but don't even know it...Does\u000aNora's/Nora's Wine Bar ring a bell??? Yes, Chef Gio is Nora's son, and we were very surprised he recognized us from our few visits to Nora's(Crazy Alfredo....YUM!!!!)\u000a\u000aYou can get Pasta, Salads. Paninis and Appetizers here, but  to come here and not order a pizza is a crime!\u000a\u000aHis pizzas come in 3 sizes-Large(14"), XL(18"), and OMG!(24") He has a few speciality pizzas, or you can customize your own. We got a  half classic combo, and half pork rules pizza(see pictures of menu items ) which was absolutely delicious! You can even chat with Gio as he makes your pizza right in front of you. He makes his pizzas the old school way by not using any commercial yeast in his dough,( it's better for you, easier to digest, and you don't feel bloated after eating his pizzas) and it goes through a 36-hour natural leavening process before it is ready. When he's out, he's out, and you have to come back another time.\u000a\u000aAnother thing to save room for is his desserts. Cannolis($1.99 each or 3 for $5)\u000aCrisp, light , delicate, and the ricotta filling has the perfect sweetness.("better than my mom's", Gio says) he also makes gelato when he has the time, and we couldn't have come at a better time. His flavor of the day? Nutella :) at $.75/ounce or $1.90 a scoop, it was definitely worth the calories! Unfortunately, they ran out of tiramisu, but\u000athat's a good reason for a return visit!\u000a\u000aBefore you go:\u000a\u000aOld School Pizzeria is located acroos the Cannery Casino, next to the Metro PCS Store, cross streets are Craig and Lawrence\u000a\u000aCash Only....\u000a\u000aThank you Gio and Diego, we will definitely be back....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(116/365) "Old School Pie"

VMy choice for flying from LAS to HNL. We're not even in Hawaii yet, but the staff and the passengers already make you feel at home.\u000a\u000aLocated in the new Terminal 3, its quick and easy to get to, and the flights we've had have always been on time. Depending on what time you fly, Hawaiian is the only airline in the country that offers a complimentary in-flight meal which is cool, but for all you picky eaters, pack food/snacks for the 5-6 hour flight.\u000a\u000aCozy chairs, options for movies and music, and a complimentary issue of Hana Hou also included? Gotta love Hawaiian!!!    ALOHA!!!

Wifey and I decided to do the 1 mile run/walk, and although it was HELLA FREEZING, it was all for a great cause.\u000araising funds for Opportunity Village.\u000a\u000aThe entertainment that was provided was cool as well, from Recycled Percussion , Zumba Dancers, Local Celebrities, Zowie Bowie, The Ladies from Fantasy, The Chippendales dancers providing eye candy for the ladies(Mayor Goodman definitely was lovin' it!) and The JABBAWOCKEEZ tore it up on stage, definitely something for everyone...Lorena, one of the ladies from Fantasy did an awesome job singing our National Anthem as well!\u000a\u000aThe parachuting Santas were a cool start for the races and as quickly as it started, the quick mile ended. Most Definitely doing the 5K next year....hope we broke the record(fingers crossed...)...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(102/365) "A Sea of Santas"

VStop #2 of our Chinatown Crawl...\u000a\u000aThis is one of the "better late than never" spots that we finally got around to trying. Cool atmosphere and HUGE menu here-Boba, Shaved Ice, Savory Bites, and Dessert...WOW! It also seems to be a great late night hangout as we also ran into the folks from Fat Choy, Jenny and Chef Sheridan gettin' their boba on as well.\u000a\u000aWe were pretty full from our previous stop so we all just got a little drinky-drink.  Drinks of all kinds confused the heck out of me- hot, cold, slush, milk, weird sounding combinations, etc.. until one that caught my attention was the caramel milk tea so I got that with boba. Surprising I didn't just stick to my usual Avocado, Taro, or Coconut Lychee! It was fantabulous and had to restrain myself from finishing it up in under 5 minutes which is usually the case especially if its a milk tea as opposed to a slush/boba smoothie.\u000a\u000aI definitely like this place over Tea station and can't wait to try their other food/drink options. They have TONS!!!            ALOHA!!!

VNOT AGAIN!!!\u000a\u000aWe were lured here by the rave reviews from fellow yelpers, but our overall experience was just A-OK...We came for Happy Hour to take advantage of their half priced pizzas.\u000a\u000aI love me some White Pizza, and I love Truffle anything, so we asked our waitress if we could do a half White/half Truffle Pizza, and the gentleman making the pizzas said it was perfectly fine....SWEET!\u000a\u000aWe were also eyeing the Di Fara, advertising their "Legendary" status, so we went with that as well. We chose the New York style for both. The service was great and the pizza guy personally delivered our pizzas to us, and even served us our first slices which was a very nice gesture.\u000a\u000aYou know how you first taste something and you have that moment of silence, and your eyes roll to the back of your head like the Exorcist because its SO DAMN GOOD?\u000aI didn't have that moment in any of our pizzas. Not the White, not the Truffle, and Not the legendary Di Fara....TASTE is everything, and what we tasted was an overkill on garlic...You can never have too much garlic, right? that's what I thought, but it got so overbearing, we wanted to like the White/Truffle pizza, but it turned out to be disappointing.The Di Fara was okay, but nothing legendary about it IMO, and I'm not such a fan of the pepperoni used here(personal preference)\u000a\u000aThey use New York water in their dough!..Yeah, yeah, yeah...the crust got hard and tough as it cooled. Obama got pizza here when he was in town! Whoop dee doo!\u000aSorry, just A-OK for me....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE-(80/100) "Dom-Founded!"

VDon't know why it took us so long to try Roamin' Dough, but I'm glad we finally did!\u000aThey happened to be at the Gourmet Food Truck Block Party this weekend, and Wifey\u000athought that the Southwestern pocket pie sounded delicious, so we got one of those along with an order of Bacon Wrapped Dates.\u000a\u000aWOW! Nothing but good flavors and textures in the filling paired with the dough which seems like a cross between a very flaky pie crust and puff pastry-SO TASTY!!!\u000a\u000aLooking for a hot date? You can find 'em here! These bacon wrapped bad boys pack such a flavor combination that you can't eat just one! Roamin' Dough's version definitely\u000aranks up there(I think it surpasses them) with Twin Creek's and Firefly's ones.\u000a\u000aDefinitely worth a visit if you haven't tried them yet...ALOHA!!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(277/365) "Pocket Pies...The NEW Hot Pocket!"

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(152/365) "King George"\u000a\u000aSo it was the week of the Second Chance Prom at the Palms, and my hair was already looking bushwhacked, but I figured I'd wait until Saturday, the day of the prom, and the only day that I'm able to see my barber due to my work schedule. Fast forward to Thursday, a notice is posted up on Instagram by my barber stating that they will CLOSED Friday and Saturday(Prom Night)\u000a\u000aNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!\u000a\u000aNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!\u000a\u000aNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!\u000a\u000a\u000aJust my luck, I tried not to panic, and the one time I cut my hair out of desperation, I came out looking like Mr.Clean,(No Lie!) so I needed to book an appointment and FAST! My previous review of Fade Kingz Barber Shop wasn't a very good first impression, but looking at the pictures of haircuts done by George convinced me to give it another go. I booked an appointment with George first thing in the morning on Saturday. 9 am Satuday morning, first one in the door with no wait, I met up with George, told him what I wanted, and he did his magic. it was clean and spacious inside and the guys were cool and able to carry on conversations, etc. 30 minutes later, I was done, relieved, and happy that George came through, and I have a go-to spot if I ever come across this same situation. \u000a\u000aKnow before you go:\u000a\u000aHaircuts start at $18, Shaves  are $15\u000a\u000aBest to make an appointment ahead of time-filled up with walk-ins by the time I was done\u000a\u000aThey are open later hours than some barbers, but prices may be higher  during the later hours\u000a\u000aLocated in the NW, same place as Comic Oasis, Marshalls, etc.\u000a\u000aIf you live on this side of town, definitely check out Fade Kingz!

VSince we're in the desert, its cool to check out local stores like this where we could catch a glimpse of the ocean with their wide selection of cool saltwater coral and marine life. Sorry, no boring fresh water fishies here....\u000aThere's your familiar ones like Nemo and Dora, Seahorses and Sea Anemonies, and never before seen ones like an Electric Scallop, and even Hawaii's state fish, the Humu'humu'nuku'nuku'apu'a'a....AKA the Picasso Triggerfish.\u000a\u000aThe staff here are very knowledgeable and always around to answer any questions you may have, or even if you're ready to take home a friend. Their reptile section is also cool- snakes, lizards, frogs, tortoises of all shapes and sizes. Stop in if you're in the Hendertucky area. Its a good place to also take the kids!....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(20/100) "Lizards and Fishies"

VStep aside Lucille's, you ain't IT anymore...Memphis?...Ewwww! Famous Dave's? C'mon now!?!?!?!?\u000a\u000aRollin' Smoke is a BBQ lover's/Carniwhore's candy store that is a family run business putting out some of the tastiest Southern style BBQ(Arkansas to be exact) in town.\u000aWifey and I stopped in for lunch and we met Dusty up front and he handed us menus. Lots to choose from and not knowing which direction to go, we ask for his suggestions and finally narrow it down to a couple of sandwiches figuring we'd get a little something(little?, YEAH RIGHT!) to hold us over until dinner. We were the only ones here, but about 10-15 minutes later, this place had a long line full of regulars! Man, we've been missing out!\u000a\u000aSo we decide to go with one meat and one non-meat item...the Pulled Piggy, and the Catfish Po-Boy. Wifey orders up, but a picture stops her in her tracks. This is a picture of one of the BADDEST burgers in town, the Outlaw Burger. It ain't on the menu, its on the podium just like those old school"Wanted Dead or Alive" posters... Just by a glance of that photo it was bye-bye catfish, bring it on Outlaw! This bad boy takes at least 15 minutes to prepare, Starting out with a pound of meat(60% Brisket 40% ground beef) it is cooked down to about 12 ounces, piled high on a toasted bun with their tangy BBQ sauce, lettuce tomato, fried onions, scallions, and cheddar cheese.\u000a\u000aSandwiches run from $7-$9, and an additional $2 gets you one side and a drink.\u000aWe got some sweet tea and chose Mac and Cheese and Yams for our sides.\u000aThe wait time exceeded the 15 minute prep time, but luckily we were in no hurry, and as I've said before, I will gladly wait for good food done right. Dusty felt kinda bad, so he dropped off an additional couple of sides-Macaroni Salad and his mom's Bacon Potato Salad which were both quite tasty.\u000a\u000aThe Pulled Piggy and the Outlaw arrive at our table, and trust me when I tell you...the portions here are HUMANGOUS!!! A skewer held the burger from toppling over, and the Pulled Piggy ain't no joke either, that is one heavy sandwich chock full of smokey, tangy goodness! The Outlaw had alot going on, but worked in perfect harmony together, and it also came with a pork rib with more of the awesome sauce(not sure if it comes with the burger, or because of the wait?)\u000aThe sides went very well with our orders too. Absolutely DEE-LISH! That Outlaw was so good, we were even able to convince another person to switch his order, and he too was lovin' it!\u000a\u000aService here was nothing short of exceptional by Dusty and an older gentleman(possibly Dad?) To cap our lunch off, some Blue Bell Vanilla Ice Cream. Tasted like Homemade Vanilla Ice Milk, and a great ending to our first visit, and most definitely not our last. Looking forward to returning, and a UYE is in the works as well...Stay Tuned! From humble beginnings on Valley View and Russell, until now, you can see the passion in the food and the whole operation itself. I wish the guys at Rollin' Smoke Barbecue nothing but continued success...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(32/100) "SooooooWiiiiiiiiiiiiT Barbecue!!!"

VThings are really looking up for Rollin' Smoke Barbecue...from being one of the first 15 reviewers, that number has jumped into the triple digits and increases everyday. After a few write-ups in local publications to recently receiving National recognition as one of the top 25 BBQ spots in the country, that is quite an achievement from John, Dusty, Tim, and Mayra and they have single handedly put Las Vegas, Nevada on the Barbecue map!\u000a\u000aWe dropped by for some true Southern Q before going to see Pin-Up at The Stratosphere. Right away, Dusty suggests the Smoked Meatloaf which has become one of their regular items on their updated and expanded menu of deliciousness. We also got the Seafood Platter with Fried Catfish, Fried Shrimp, Hush Puppies and Fried Okra which they were out of, so one of the cooks suggested the Corn Fritters, and those did not disappoint! Seasoned well and the sweet creaminess of the corn was very tasty!\u000a\u000aThis huge slab of meaty goodness arrives on top a bed of loaded mashed potatoes, and sweet crispy onions with a sweet BBQ sauce and is one of  the tastiest renditions of an American classic that I've come across! The seafood platter is served with lemon, hot sauce, and tartar sauce was equally delicious. The Shrimp had a crisp outside while still keeping that plump, juicy interior, The Catfish was nice, crisp and flaky, and I'm no hush puppy expert but I thought those were just okay.\u000a\u000aIf you're still in search of some killer barbecue, you may want to bookmark Rollin' Smoke, it may just become one of your  favorite spots! ALOHA!!!

VGreat spot near us to let Dolce run around...The field in this park is huge, and there's also a concrete walkway circling the field if you feel like taking a stroll.\u000a\u000aDuring the Summer months, there is a water park section for the kids and a few picnic tables as well. A great place for the families and their furry friends...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(124/365) "Dolce's Park"

VStopped in for breakfast because wifey's never been, and its a favorite within the Yelp Las Vegas community.\u000a\u000aNot only is it my favorite meal of the day, but I almost always have to get a savory item AND a sweet item. Wifey kept it simple and ordered Cheesy scrambled eggs and hash browns with an upgrade of Rocky Road pancakes. I had the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette, substituted the macaroni salad (but still got it anyway) and  upgraded to their famous Red Velvet Pancakes. I love banana pancakes and banana cream pie, so  I had to try their banana cream pie pancakes as well.\u000a\u000aI KINDA SORTA FORGOT two important words though.......\u000a\u000aShort Stack.........DOH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Must've been a sign of hunger!)\u000a\u000aI killed my omelette and  we both preferred the Red velvet pancakes as the rocky road ones sounded better than it tasted. Out came the Banana Cream Pie Pancakes, and that plate of 6(or was it 8???) pancakes was enough for 2-3 people! I dug in and wow! were they good! It felt like I was eating dessert for breakfast. I also kinda wish they would've toasted the almonds for added flavor though, just sprinkling them on raw didn't do any justice.\u000a\u000aAnywho, although I didn't kill it, I did some serious damage leaving just one pancake  left. "Whoa!, you really put a dent in those pancakes!" A table next to us said..."Are you a competitve eater?" "No, but I did have 80 pieces of sushi in one sitting, and put away a 12 scoop bucket of ice cream with the works in an hour." I replied........ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(195/365) "My Valiant Effort"

VThe folks from the Lee's Liquor not only know their booze, but they also know their Korean BBQ as well. Woonam Jung is fast becoming the king of K-BBQ in the 702.\u000aHaving tried other places such as Sura and Woo-Che, Woonam Jung gets the edge in quality, cleanliness, and variety. We were fortunate to have Jieun L. on our table to give us a crash course on K-BBQ etiquette and to expidite the ordering of each round smoother than a baby's butt...well, almost as smooth as that-our server seemed a little frazzled probably from the amount of food and water we consumed,(but that's what happens when you got Dr.J and The Hungry Hawaiian on the same table!?!?!?)  but kept her composure and got some assistance later from a Ben-tern look-a-like...

VAfter hearing raves about the KJ Dim Sum & Seafood location inside the Rio, we were finally able to give it a go.\u000a\u000aThe carts come around pretty rapidly, every item we ordered was delicious, and the egg custard tarts are some of the best I've tasted. I like the Rice Cakes here too because they give me a little taste of home.\u000a\u000aServers are quick to clear dishes and refill hot tea, and the prices are a bit higher than other dim sum joints around town, but worth every penny.

VTeri C.'s talk about rice cakes and our so-so experience at Koi Palace got me jonezing for some dim sum again.\u000a\u000aI believe their dim sum hours are 10am-3pm. The earlier you come the better the selections will be, and they do run out of dishes. We arrived at Noon and it was pretty packed, but lucky for us, there was a two top ready and waiting for us. It was kinda chilly outside, so I ordered some Congee with chicken, chinese donut, and century  egg. I gave Wifey a taste, and she liked it so much,  I had to flag the lady down again so she could get her own! Other dishes we enjoyed were the Soup Dumplings, Har Gow, Shu Mai, Chicken Feet, Beef Short Ribs, and Fried Shrimp Wontons with sweet Mayo. Be sure to ask for the Chili Oil to enjoy with your dim sum...it is more like a chili-garlic ketchup and is ADDICTING!\u000a\u000aThe sweet selections didn't disappoint either. Custard Tarts are some of the best in town, Coconut Buns and Custard Buns are tasty, and of course, the Rice Cakes...One of three places I know who have this, and KJ does it best. Stop in the next time you have a hankering for some solid dim sum in Vegas.

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(177/365) "Those Taro Buns Tho'!"\u000a\u000aStill a great place to get your dim sum fix, and I'd like to hope much safer considering it is inside a Hotel/Casino as opposed to a free standing restaurant in Chinatown(I'm looking at you, Cathay House!) If you haven't seen that "Dirty Dining" segment, better check it out!\u000a\u000aEveryone has their opinion on dim sum , and KJ is still in my top 3. They are fast, there are a lot of items to choose from, and from my experience here, they always got different things on the cart I haven't seen or tried. After grubbin' on some savory offerings, the dessert cart comes around and I grab my usual Rice Cakes and there are these buns with a white crunchy topping, so wifey asks about it and we find out they are Taro Buns. We get them, and it was love at first bite! They weren't real taro root though, it was purple sweet potato, and they were BOMB!\u000a\u000aAfter paying our bill and on our way out, I spied similar looking buns on a cart and asked the lady what they were...They also have Green Tea Buns too which is another excuse to return!

VTucked away in the Santa Fe Station food court, Capriotti's seemed like the best choice of all the food options there. I usually go back and forth between the Bobbie and the Capistrami, and this time, I wanted a hot sandwich so I got a Capistrami before going to the movies. The combination and contrast of the hot pastrami combined with the cold slaw and russian dressing makes this an addicting sandwich that you take one bite after another until there is no more!\u000a\u000aI ended up sneaking the other half of my sandwich in because we weren't keeping track of time and didn't wanna end up with junk seats, That was a great sandwich, and I prefer that any day over a bucket of outrageously priced popcorn with that fake butter...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(150/365) "The Smuggled Sandwich"

VDeep in the heart of Hendertucky off Water Street and Pacific Avenue, you will find some solid local grindz on the 9th Island.\u000a\u000aAfter church, we were hungry, so we decided to check out a different spot for dinner.\u000asince we were in  the area, we decided to give Islander's Grill a try. They have a pretty extensive menu but we just narrowed it down to two items- Chicken Katsu and Kekoa's Saimin loaded with mandoo, kamaboko, char siu, roast pork, mustard greens and broccoli.\u000a\u000aWe were the only ones there, but luckily we had already ordered because within 10 minutes, 4 big parties showed up and we waited a good minute for our food. I'm not gonna ding them for the existing taqueria look that stil exists. The paintings, longboard, vintage Primo Beer shirt, and Eddie Aikau banner paired with the sounds of The Makaha Sons of Ni'i'hau, Peter Moon Band and other Hawaiian groups makes me feel I'm back home. The laid back service seems to be the culprit here, and that's something that will have to change if they expect to stay in business. The food was pretty good though. I love lots of goodies in my saimin and the noodles and broth were very tasty too. It ain't Shiro's, but good enough for being in Vegas.\u000a\u000aThe Chicken Katsu was perfection! Every piece was crispy, juicy, and didn't taste greasy or soggy at all. The portions were MASSIVE too. I could imagine what the Ali'i\u000a(King)plates look like! I would like to come back and try other items, but I hope they'll find a solution to their service issues which could be a turn off to some...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-( 235/365) "Grindz At The Grill"

VYes, Kathy's is back....In the former Bird and Bonz BBQ Spot across from Wo Fat Chinese Restaurant, she's pumpin' out her Louisiana style Southern Cooking. On our visit, we stopped by for dinner and were surprised to see and hear that nearly all of the patrons  were "happy to find her again" or thought she had gone out of business.\u000a\u000aThis new spot is definitely  clean, and the kitchen area isn't cramped up like her former location. The dining area is much smaller with only about 6 tables. \u000aanother good change is that the prices have dropped and aren't outrageous anymore.(Rent was definitely higher in Henderson which is probably the reason of the high prices before). Kathy is there with her husband and her son(I think) who is the Fried Chicken Master.\u000a\u000aOf course we had to get the Fried Chicken Dinner and endure the 20-minute wait. We also shared The BBQ Ribs, and aside from the corn bread, we got mac and cheese, cole slaw, yams, and mashed potatoes and gravy since they were out of potato salad. The ribs were okay as was the sides. the cornbread was a little dry, but the Chicken was definitely worth the wait. Crispy skin and hot & juicy in every bite(you get a breast, thigh, and a wing). For dessert, we got a slice of Sweet Potato Pie and the Banana Pudding. Pie was a little overkill on the spices, and the banana pudding was alright. I would probably return for the chicken.\u000a\u000aGone are the additional fees, and they do take plastic....another thing I noticed is they give refills on tea and lemonade, but charge for punch, Hawaiian Punch...Give them a try and see what you think...It's tons better than Ella Ems, that's for sure...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(164/365) "Kathy's Back!"

VIts been over a year since my FTR of Kathy's at this location, so its long overdue for an update, also since we were in the mood for some Fried Chicken, and as I said in my previous review, "I'd probably return for the fried chicken" and that's just what we did! .We stopped in for lunch and ordered up two fried chicken dinners($10.75 ea.) and wifey chose yams and mac & cheese for her sides. I went with potato salad and collard greens. Ordering different sides allows you to try different things because they're big enough for sharing. The Cornbread was nothing special and always on the dry side\u000a\u000aI'm usually a leg and thigh guy, but somehow, a huge breast made it onto my plate!\u000aNo complaints here, but as many times as we've had their fried chicken dinner, we would always recieve a thigh, wing, and drumstick. Breast pieces cost extra. There are reviews that slam them on service and cleanliness, but when I went to wash my hands, there was no sign of backed up sewage smell. Service has always been great, and our waitress even remembered us from when we used to dine at the old Mountain Vista location (Yelp HQ STILL hasn't taken that old business page down!?)\u000a\u000aCrispy skin and juiciness in every bite, some may feel its on the bit on the salty side, but balance it out with all the tasty sides and sweet tea, It ended up being one of the tastiest lunches we've had in a while, and the pictures don't lie...Yes, Vegas has slim pickins when it comes to soul food places, and I've tried many other places(House of Flavor-RIP, M&M's, and Ella Em's, and these places don't even come close when it comes to fried chicken IMHO. If you're in the area and got the patience to wait for fried chicken done right, you may want to give Kathy's a try....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(40/100) "KFC...Kathy's Fried Chicken"

VMISSION: TO FIND THE BEST TACOS ON LAS VEGAS' STREETS\u000a\u000aWHO: STREET VENDORS AROUND LAS VEGAS(Brick and mortars like Los Tacos and El Gordo DON"T COUNT)\u000a\u000aStop #3, We come across 2 good signs: 1) a pretty good sized crowd, and 2) A carousel of Al Pastor goodness complete with pineapple juices flowing down and basting  all the meat-SOLD!\u000a.\u000aTaqueria El Pastorcito(not to be confused with Tacos El Pastorcito) is another Pop-up vendor that serves up tacos Thursday-Sunday as well from 6-late(1-2am)\u000atheir tacos are slightly bigger than KoMex size, and are $2 each.\u000a\u000aRight away, one of the workers asks if we're ready to order, but I'm still browsing the menu items which are plastered across the window, again with funny names, so my wife tells him its our first time here, and right away, he signals for one of the cooks to give him an order of Al Pastor. He hands it to us so we can taste the love.(Keep in mind\u000athat it is a plus to speak  and understand Spanish, and you won't get service with a smile here. Although they're quick and efficient, thats just the way it is, as it is in different countries.) One bite, and we were HOOKED! Perfectly seasoned, just the right amount of fattiness and charred taste with the sweetness of the pineapple. I can honestly say that this taco kicks the S@#T out of El Gordo's  version.\u000a\u000aWe also got some agua de Jamaica to share and some Chocolate Champurrado cause it was kinda nippy...Good find and we will definitely return and try other stuff!\u000a\u000aPROS:\u000a\u000aQuick, efficient service\u000a\u000aOpen Late\u000a\u000aAwesome Al Pastor\u000a\u000a\u000aCONS:\u000a\u000aYou may get lost in communication...\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a**RECOMMENDATIONS**\u000a\u000a-Of course, their Tacos Al Pastor-You won't be dissappointed!\u000a\u000a-Agua Frescas(Check to see what kind they have)\u000a\u000aALOHA!!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(167/365) "Street Taco Scramble Part 3"

VUpdate:\u000a\u000aOn one of our many returns here, there were at least 20-30 people here which is a very good sign, and what were they ordering? Al Pastor...in tacos, tortas, burritos, you name it. almost everyone had ordered it. Al pastor is what these guys pride themselves on and they got the BIGGEST carousel in town to prove it.\u000a\u000a The taste is like no other. Not as spicy as El Gordo's version, but definitely more flavorful, tacos here are the same price, but much larger than El Gordo's. Don't forget to ask for pineapple on your al pastor, and I like that the pineapple here is diced up small and sprinkled on your taco. You get pineapple in every bite. Some of there other meat selections here are some of the tastiest I've found. The Cabeza(Beef Head) is shredded beef that has a great flavor and not dry at all, and another one of my favorites are the Suadero(Beef Brisket) Just the right amount of meat and fat which is also flavorful and well seasoned. I always get Al Pastor and Suadero every time I stop here.\u000a\u000aNext time you're in the area and you have your mind set on going to El Gordo's,\u000alook for the lights, and the huge Al Pastor Carousel which is just up the street on the opposite side and give these guys a try, they honestly have some of the tastiest tacos\u000ain town...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(212/365) "The Al Pastor Kings"

VCame back to the Al Pastor Kings when Mom and Pop were in town. Its cool to see that they're always down to try stuff, especially when you can't get this kind of quality Mexican grub back in Hawaii.\u000a\u000aI got a few tacos for mom and Pop to try- a couple of Al Pastor, Lengua, and Cabeza.\u000aI was hungry and I wanted to try a Torta de Al Pastor, and Wifey got a Burrito de Al Pastor. My torta was HUGE! It covered the whole plate and the bread was toasted nicely, and very generous with the al pastor, pineapple, tomato, and avocado.\u000a\u000aWifey's Burrito was a slight disappointment-generous on the meat, skimpy on the cheese, barely any beans, and no rice FYI...better off sticking to the tacos and tortas.\u000aMom and Pop enjoyed their tacos and loved the cabeza the most . I was glad that I could get them away from their usual In-N-Out fix for a change, and they were very pleased. Again, Mom said "This is way better than the Mexican spots back home." Gotta agree with Mom on that too!....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(62/100) "Street Grindz with Mom and Pop"

VFirst things first...I went in with an open mind and an empty stomach...Noticing a lot of\u000a5-Star reviews from a handful of Yelp friends, I began to think-Are we missing out on other AYCE joints? Is my usual spot slipping like they say it is? Is Sushi Koma that good? Only one way to find out....Go!\u000a\u000aWe sat down for dinner one evening and almost immediately received our drinks and complimentary Edamame. Right off the bat, I order the "one per person"items-Uni, Amaebi, Carpaccio, and Sashimi Roll. We also got the Brie and Grape Quesadilla.\u000aQuesadilla was good, but kinda skimpy on the brie and grape, Amaebi was plump and sweet, Sashimi Roll was good, and I liked the addition of the garlic chips on the carpaccio, but didn't care that it was swimming in the sauce. Uni didn't arrive.\u000a\u000aNigiri was up next. Salmon, Scallop and Hamachi were good. The Saba was exceptional and I killed about 6 orders alone. Still no Uni, so our waitress reminds the chef. We assume that the Uni is on its way and we go with a few rolls-Elephant, one with beef on top, and one with soft shell crab. Forgot the names, but overall, rolls were forgettable... The Elephant was okay, the beef roll was barely evident because the overkill on the green onion and eel sauce, and the texture on the soft shell crab was almost non existent from being fine chopped, I like to bite into the body, leg, or claw when I order anything with soft shell crab, know what I mean?\u000a\u000a Our waitress was still surprised we didn't get our uni, and in Korean, she and the chef were going back and forth for an awkward moment, and after 5 minutes, our chef reassured us that the uni was coming...don't know what happened there, but maybe he was saving the best for last? Got to devour the 4 pieces of uni which were very sweet, and we ordered up dessert.\u000a\u000aOnly ONE item per person, so I went with Green Tea Ice Cream and Wifey went with Coffee Mochi. She liked my Ice cream better, because this Green Tea tasted more floral, from being made with a green tea extract, as opposed from it being made from green tea powder. Choose wisely people, you only get one choice here. \u000aService was awesome, food....just shy of me being a fan...it is what it is..\u000aMoral of our visit? The Sushi isn't always greener on the other side!.....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(52/100) "Komatose"

I also tried a Taco de Tripa(Beef Intestine) It was kinda small and still pretty good. Right now, the best Tripa IMO is at Tacos Cancun.\u000a\u000aDefinitely room for improvement and with time, they'll get better....ALOHA!!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(179/365) "Street Taco Scramble Round 2"

VMahalo to Leonel M. for a great find!\u000a\u000aThis hidden gem is located way in the back of a strip mall across Cardenas Supermarket.(Decatur and Meadows) Our original plan was to hit up Karina's 2 for some bomb cabeza tacos.\u000aThey were closed, so we got on the Yelp App and Tacos Los Tarascos was just down the street.\u000a\u000aMost taquerias in Vegas have the usual standbys-Asada, Al Pastor, Carnitas etc.\u000aBut TLT goes above and beyond and gives you the Real Deal Holyfield of taquerias as far as selections go...\u000aStep inside, and go straight up to the counter. No menus here, On the side of the refrigerator, their menu offerings read plain and simple:\u000a\u000aTacos $1.49, Burritos $4.99\u000aThe 8 offerings to fill your Taco or Burrito are of course:\u000a\u000aAsada\u000aLengua\u000aAdobada\u000aPollo\u000aCabeza\u000a\u000aand for the more adventureous:(I haven't seen anywhere else)\u000a\u000aLabio (lip)\u000aCachete(cheek)\u000aOjo(eye)\u000a\u000awe were on the fence about these last 3 offerings, especially the lip and eye, and after the guy behind the counter gave us a taste, we were surprised on how good they were, and we switched out some of our cabeza tacos, we gladly swapped it out for some cheek, lip, and eye action, and we ate them all...we even tried wax moth larvae tacos in SF at Off The Grid, and I can say that these are just as tasty, So don't knock it til you try it, and tap into your inner Andrew Zimmern and check out the more interesting offerings of this taqueria....EYE DARE YOU.....ALOHA!!!!

VANOTHER GREAT LOCAL FIND!!!!\u000a\u000aFinishing up our street taco scramble and driving along Charleston Blvd., Wifey sees a bunch of people in a parking lot of a hidden away strip mall, so I quickly turn around, and as we pass by, I see "Paleteria Y Neveria" and like Eddie Murphy Delirious, I shout "ICE CREEEEAM!!!". Yup, we stumbled upon a Mexican artisinal ice cream shop! There must've been at least 20-30 people when we got there and as you step inside, you really feel like you're in Mexico.\u000a\u000aAll the ice creams, sorbets, and paletas(fruit/dairy bars) are all made in house, and it doesn't stop there. Agua frescas, fresh squeezed juices, and smoothies, Mexican style sweets and desserts and even a bunch of Mexican antojos(savory snacks) are offered here as well. What I also love about La Flor De Michoacan is their unique flavors they have.\u000a\u000aFrom an alfalfa agua fresca, mango and chile fruit bar,  ice cream and sorbet flavors like Chongos(Michoacan style dessert), Elote(Corn), Grape, and Guanabana(Soursop)\u000ayou won't find these at Baskin Robins or Tropical Smoothie Cafe.The savory snacks looked interesting as well. People were ordering Tostilocos, which were a bag of your choice of chips filled with ingredients like tomato, cucumber, avocado, cheese, lime, and hot sauce, all mixed up in that same bag, and also the Duroloco, a HUGE rectangle  crispy wafer\u000a(kinda like chicharron texture) topped with pickled pork rind,cabbage, cheese, avocado, cucumber, lime, and hot sauce. The lady that helped us was patient enough and explained any questions about the snacks and even offered a sample of any flavors we wanted to try. \u000a\u000a"What's a different flavor you have that no one else makes?" I asked. "Would you like to try our Pinon(Pine Nut)?" she suggested....I love pine nuts and they're a pretty pricey nut, but after sampling that, I was hooked and I couldn't decide between that and the Guanabana sorbet which I also sampled, so I did the most sensible thing and got both. Wifey got a scoop of the Chongos Ice cream and we decided to try a Duroloco as well. I loved all the ice cream flavors we got, and for me, the Duroloco was okay, maybe I didn't get to enjoy it as much from having tacos earlier and having my mind already set on dessert.\u000a\u000aWe'll most definitely be back because I want to try all of the other unique flavors and snacks they have. Besides this location, they have three others in town- one in the food court at The Boulevard Mall, one at 6055 E. Lake Mead Blvd., and another one at 2670 N. Las Vegas Blvd.  Next time you're in the mood for sweets and snacks, give them a try....ALOHA!!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(184/365)-"Mexican Style Sweet Shop"

VStopped in again to try more of their sweet treats, and this time we went for the banana split-3 scoops of ice cream, your choice of toppings(sprinkles, coconut, chocolate sauce(magic shell kind), peanuts and puffed cereal(kinda like sugar smacks) whipped cream, sliced strawberries, and wafer cookies. All that for only $5.50!!!!\u000a\u000aWifey chose Grape,(Tastes like a grape candy) Corn (think sweet corn tomalito from Chevy's in ice cream form), and Pine Nut and I was undecided, so I tried a flavor called Rosas, which was a peanut flavored ice cream studded with dried fruits and almonds, but I wasn't feeling that, so I went with Cajeta, Coconut, and Pistachio. The staff here at LFM are so nice and helpful, you can ask for a taste of any flavor of ice cream or even a sip of any agua fresca to help you decide. Wifey was chatting with the owner and as I was snapping photos, instead of putting me on blast and prohibiting photos like some people may do, he started to ham it up and gave me a paleta demonstration!  COOOOL!!!! He was making Strawberry Paletas and put the mixture in the molds and plunged them into a water bath that was 20 below freezing point-BRRRR!\u000a\u000aWe saw that alot of people were buying Agua Frescas, so we perused the flavors they had-Alfalfa, Mamey, Horchata, Melon, Tamarind and one we never heard of, Cebada."It's VERY good!" mentioned a couple who drove from Blue Diamond just to get their fix. We asked for a sample and it tasted like a cross between coffee and Salvadorean style Horchata(they toast their rice, as opposed to Mexican style Horchata, where the rice is not toasted) One of the workers later told us it was toasted barley. Very tasty!\u000a\u000a"Where's the Camera!?" said the owner. In a matter of minutes, the batch of paletas\u000awere ready and he wanted me to snap a photo-Such a ham!!! Our banana splits were also ready and we thanked them again and the owner told us to come back again for some other flavors they were making, like Avocado Ice Cream and Tequila Sorbet. Oh yeah, we'll definitely return...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(194/365) "Paletas in minutes"

VUPDATE:\u000a\u000aThis visit, the parking lot was full, and there literally was a line out the door, but what do you expect from a bomb-ass ice cream shop? It was a warm day and there were at least 40-50 people. with even more as time passed. Wifey got a scoop of Queso(like cheesecake) and pine nut. I got the same flavors and added a scoop of Aguacate(Avocado) ice cream. it was so smooth with the right sweetness, it tasted like an avocado boba smoothie without the boba, with puffed rice cereal for my free topping.\u000a\u000aThey also do Tacos right outside the shop for $1.50 each, and there's also a lady who sells pirated DVD's and Soundtracks of John Carter, Hunger Games and other current titles. Yes, this place can get a little claustrophobic, but its definitely worth the visit. They are open 7 days a week from 9am-9pm to cure your sweet tooth cravings....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(210/365) "Sweet Tooth Fix"

VIt's a hot 110 degrees out and one of the best things to do is hit up La Flor De Michoacan!\u000a\u000aTheir artisinal ice cream flavors are not like anywhere else, and their agua frescas are much better than Cardenas IMHO...We stopped in and it was packed as usual. Amazingly this time though, I didn't get any ice cream( I always get pine nut, mamey, and avocado) I just got their biggest cup of Alfalfa Agua Fresca.(Stop making those "yuck" faces!) It actually tastes ALOT better than it sounds, kinda like cucmber and citrus...\u000a\u000astop in if you're in the area and wanting to cool down, you'll be glad you did!...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(320/365) "Try The Green Water!"

VOn our latest visit, we dropped by after the Grassroots event with President Obama and Latin Rock group MANA. Aside from my usual ice cream fix, I proceeded to get my usual Alfalfa agua fresca, and one of the young ladies behind the counter suggested her favorite by mixing half alfalfa with half pineapple agua fresca, and man, was I HOOKED! Now I always get a large one every time we drop in. At $2.50, its a very refreshing deal!\u000a\u000aFor those of you who love sweet and savory combinations with a nice heat, The Paleton is not to be missed. Wifey tried it out of curiosity, and that too got us hooked as well!\u000aTwo foot long paletas(popsicles) your choice of mango or pineapple, on a bed of sliced cucumber and diced mangoes drizzled with Valentina and Chamoy sauces, and Chilito seasoning...SO GOOD! This has also become one of our favorite items.\u000a\u000aTake it from the Duke...I am Nelson Q., and I approve of this message...;)    ALOHA!!!

Produce can be hit or miss... My go to stores are still Cardenas, 168 Market and Greenland because those stores tend to have more of the types of food items I would usually shop for...ALOHA!!!

VIn conjunction with First Friday, this first time spectacle generated a ton of buzz and alot of people came out to see the burning of Lucky Lady Lucy, signifying a new beginning and a stronger sense of community in Las Vegas. The media was also on hand and up in the air as well, as was the Po-Po and the fire department to ensure everything went as planned. Props to the people who constructed Lucky Lady Lucy who was also dressed for the occasion sporting a skirt, bikini top, and a boa just like a Vegas Showgirl.\u000a\u000aProps also to the Burning Man Organization, where representatives from Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, and Vegas provided the inspiration and entertainment for the evening\u000awhich was cool at first, but seemed to drag on just a bit too long. People started to bail little by little, which was cool with me, cause my view got better! They also put on a fire show\u000aof flame throwing and hula hoop spinning. They also took a page from Polynesian fire knife dancing and poi bowl twirling and did their own creative version of it. Next came a ghetto style burning man opera which was kinda entertaining, but some of the crowd got restless as more time passed, and grandma who was in the crowd led a chant of "Burn that b@#!h"\u000aothers seemed to go the Jim Morrison route and scream "c'mon baby light my fire!" After all the entertainers were cleared out, Unlucky Lucy was stripped down, set up with burn gel, dowsed with kerosene, then the CEO of Zappo's lit the fuse which created not a blaze, but more of a creeping fire, and when it hit Sally's crotch area, a spectator got everyone rolling by saying "she's got a burning sensation between her legs!.....Yeast infection????"....always a comedian in the crowd!\u000a\u000aA few minutes later Sally was totally engulfed in flames, and before you know it, she was extra crispy.....THE END!.......ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(190/365) " Burn Baby Burn!"

VHonesty is most definitely the best policy....We were driving in the area trying to decide what we were gonna have for dinner. Flavor Flav's House Of Flavor was on the Yelp app, so we decided to do a drive by(with no firearms, of course!)\u000aThere was a small crowd outside, and I figured it wasn't so bad....we've waited on longer lines-food trucks, airports, and even 3 hours to get Carrie Fisher's(Princess Leia's) autograph, so we could handle this...\u000a\u000aUpon getting in line, people were getting impatient, so they left one by one(probably to Church's) and we were the next ones to go in(Flav's posse was only letting 2 people in at a time to control the madness) 15-20 minutes later, we see through the window that Flavor Flav was talking to the crowd and something was up...\u000aDID HE RUN OUT OF CHICKEN??? WAS HE SHUTTING IT DOWN FOR THE EVENING???\u000aThe Verdict? He was shutting it down.....:(  :( :( :(.....NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!\u000a\u000a"OH HELL NO!!!!" ..."F#$K THIS S@*T"? ..."THAT AIN'T RIGHT!!!"\u000aOn and on people were ranting as they left...a few of us waited patiently for answers\u000aand Flav came out to address the people. Here's how it went down...\u000a\u000aFLAV: "I just wanna thank y'all for coming out and being so patient"....."What's the best policy?????...Honesty, Right?"\u000a\u000aTHE CROWD(About 10 of us stayed back and waited)-nod our heads in agreement...\u000a\u000aFLAV:"Which is why I am so sorry, but I decided to shut it down because I'm not happy with the frying grease that I got in today...It ain't got the flavor I'm looking for, and I would NEVER serve it to y'all if I wasn't happy with it, ya feel me?"\u000a\u000a"BUT.....imma invite y'all in for a taste and I want your honest to goodness truth, aight?...Come on in."\u000a\u000aTHE CROWD: Cheering with excitement!!!!!\u000a\u000aWe all go in, Flav's posse locks the door behind us, and turns away the rest of the public.\u000a\u000aFlav hands each of us a piece of chicken, meanwhile one dude takes his piece and bolts out the door..."He didn't even tell me what he thought about my chicken!?!?!" said Flav..."Well, he forgot his book..Each one of y'all are gettin' a copy of my book cause I want y'all to know my story, and I appreciate y'all comin' down...we cool?"\u000a\u000aTHE CROWD: Cheering with even more excitement!!!!\u000a\u000aThe room was pretty quiet when we bit into our chicken...I usually go for the dark meat, but man was the breast meat SO FRICKIN' JUICY!!! not dry at all, really crispy skin on the outside and perfectly seasoned. Lucky my Momma's all the way in Hawaii, beacause it was"Slap Yo Momma" GOOD!!! Flav then starts chatting it up with the crowd introducing us to the missus, and he says"this is son #7, Karma"\u000athen he added "and just to let y'all know, I'll be trying for #8!!! and lets out his trademark Flavor Flav laugh that has everyone ROLLING!!!! "Ay, I'm 53 years old, I gotta get it in when I can ya know!?!?"\u000a\u000a"So what y'all think?"...."Would you pay for this?" ......"Oh yeah! most definitely" we all agreed...."So should I drop some more?" Flav says....Cheers from the crowd yet again..."Y'all know what Bob Marley said, right?....."Evryting is gonna be alright" and in the tune of "No Woman No Cry", Flav gets to work and starts singing "No Chicken We Cry"........"Because if there ain't no chicken, we all gonna cry, right?".....Gotta love this man! \u000a\u000a"Well, if I'm gonna  be workin', I need me some music!"..."Turn it up!"\u000aPublic Enemy's hits blast through the speakers throughout the night including my favorite,"Fight The Power". The clock wearin' chicken frying machine pumps out  chicken like nobody's business.We get Flav's biography and our orders which was missing a couple more pieces, but Flav's staff quickly fixed that problem. As other reviews mention, the sides definitely could use some improvement, but as for the chicken, it is on point, and really is the best in town. I really hope he works out the kinks and stays in town for a very long time because he's definitely got a good product, and Flav is totally good people. Before you go, here are some things you ought to know:\u000a\u000a-Still in the opening phase, THERE ARE NO SET HOURS....YET! Give it some time, be patient...otherwise, GO AT YOUR OWN RISK\u000a\u000a-Credit Cards accepted\u000a\u000a-It is a TAKE OUT establishment...place your order...wait for your order....pay/pick up your order....and get out....no dining room folks...your car is the dining room.\u000a\u000a-Double check your order to make sure you got what you ordered\u000a\u000a-If you're gonna disrespect Flav and his food cause your dumbass is too picky and impatient ( Yeah, I'm talkin' to you Shaniqua and Ray-Ray) and you can't wait for the best chicken in town, I've got 3 suggestions for you:\u000a\u000a1) Church's\u000a\u000a2) Popeye's\u000a\u000a3) MAKE IT YOUR OWN DAMN SELF!!!!!!\u000a\u000aWith all that being said, Thank you and your staff Flav, and welcome to the neighborhood!!!...ALOHA!!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(200/365) "Fun Times with Flavor Flav"

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(179/365) "Quantity Yes, Quality, Not So Much"\u000a\u000aWe stopped in after being disappointed at Puma, and the staff here are very energetic and welcoming, always helpful and eager to get you what you need. Searching around, I go to the Puma/Adidas section and they have you usual Puma items, but no new release stuff... I spy a sweet pair of Adidas Original Gazelles so I ask if it was available in my size.\u000a\u000aPerusing the store, I also saw a HUGE Puma display stand in the form of a Puma Suede which would be awesome in my room, but unfortunately isn't for sale...:(\u000aThe lady helping me returns with more sad news...they don't have my size which sucks, but oh well, nothing I can do! This place is almost exactly like any shoe outlet, which is hit and miss...you may or may not find what your looking for, but it's not the end of the world.

VThis is another one of those "Why the hell did it take so long for us to try this spot?" Kinda reviews. Better later on, than never, right?\u000a\u000aIt's 105 degrees out, and we're looking for a lunch spot...The first thing that pops into my mind is cold soba noodles, and we've never been, so we finally make the trek to I-Naba.When you step inside, it slowly transforms you away from the desert and makes you feel like you're in Japan. Minimalist decor, japanese instrumental music to add to the mood, and no TV....Great sign!\u000a\u000aThe service here is impeccable. The ladies always check on you, service with a smile, and very imformative and helpful with any questions you may have. The ice cold barley tea was perfect for the hot weather, and our cups were never empty.\u000a\u000aI went with the Battera and Zaru Combination and wifey has gotten into a tempura phase, so she went with the Tempura Bowl and Zaru Combination.\u000aOur waitress had mentioned a Chicken and Shrimp Chawanmushi ( Japanese Savory Steamed Custard) that was excellent, so we decided to try that as well. She wasn't lying! The custard was smooth and steamed to perfection, studded with pieces of chicken and shrimp and topped with sprouts and lemon peel.\u000a\u000aOur lunch combos arrive and we dig in...nothing but raves with everything we ordered! From the crisp shrimp and vegetable tempura with the tasty seasoned rice on the bottom, each grain was seperate without being sticky and oh so soft and addicting. The Battera was so good, I contemplated getting another order. The Soba totally hit the spot. you could see the specks of buckwheat throughout  the perfectly cooked noodles, as opposed to the typical dark packaged ones available in Asian markets. I loved the fact that slurping your noodles  was not a problem here, and they add a traditional touch by giving you some warm soba cooking water to add to your leftover soba dipping sauce which you drink like a cup of hot tea at the end of your meal.\u000a\u000aWe ended our lunch on a sweet note. Two desserts we tried were the Buckwheat Crepes with Azuki Beans,  Pecans, Kinako (Toasted Soybean Powder) Ice Cream and Kuromitsu(Japanese Black Sugar) Sauce. The contrast between the warm soft crepe with the cold nutty taste of the ice cream and the hints of sweetness from the azuki beans and sauce was very delicious. The Yuzu Yogurt Sorbet was a very refreshing alternative. Very citrusy with a slight tartness from the yogurt, a crunchy tuile cookie and topped with pop rocks which adds a fun factor! Can't wait to come back to devour other tasty dishes from I-Naba!.....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(283/365) "Slurpin' Soba"

VOne of our favorite spots for lunch, we returned thanks to this Vegas heat for some cold soba action....Twice in two weeks!\u000a\u000aTheir Battera and Zaru Combo is no longer offered, so I went with the Tonkatsu Don/Zaru Combination and that too, was absolutely DELISH!\u000a\u000aOn Father's Day, They ran a special 4-course menu of Battera, Spicy Kara-Age Chicken Wings, Cold Zaru and Tempura Bowl and Coconut Ice cream for dessert which was very tasty as well. If you're looking for a Japanese restaurant serving simple, honest food with delicious, clean flavors, I-Naba is your spot....ALOHA!!!

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(169/365) "Soba Addiction"\u000a\u000aI guess its a good thing they were out of the Katsu-Don on one of our most recent visits, otherwise I would have never known how good the Chirashi Bowl was! That Salmon Oshizushi is also so tasty and I'm glad I also gave that a try instead of going for my usual Battera fix.\u000a\u000aService here has always been top notch and you don't have TV screens, music blasting, or obnoxious patrons here so you can totally enjoy your meal here without any unnecessary distractions. Everything I have ordered here throughout the years has been great and I have no complaints.\u000a\u000aAnother piece of perfection besides the chef's soba(No one in town does it better than I-Naba) is his rice. Often overlooked in some Japanese establishments, but not here...spot on each and every time.   ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  5

VLarry and Sheri have taken their love of loose leaf teas, turned it into a blossoming business, and turned us Yelpers on to perhaps some of the best teas from Herbata Tea Co. and smoothies in town.\u000a\u000aDuring all the workouts at Shine Fitness, we got to rehydrate and  sample the smoothies- Strawberry-Banana, Java Jolt, and Pineapple-Banana which were all very tasty!  Out of all the teas I tried, (Mango Mist, Cream Earl Grey, Peach-Apricot, and Bourbon Street Vanilla) My favorite was a mix of the Earl Grey and the Bourbon Street Vanilla which Larry had suggested we try. Sheri also provided some healthy snacks as well. We also got to nibble on some brownie protein bars and Pirate's Booty Cheese Puffs too!\u000a\u000aBig Thank you and best wishes to Larry and Sheri for sharing knowledge, being so hospitable, and most of all, keeping us hydrated and refueled the whole time!...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(213/365) "Larry and Sheri's Thirst Aid Station"

VMy brows were starting to look Neanderthal-ish, so I needed to get that under control.\u000aI remember driving past a threading spot close to Smashburger up in my hood, so we checked this place out.\u000a\u000aClean and inviting, the ladies greet you walking in, and there are comfy chairs to chillax until your turn is up. Other services performed here are Henna and Glitter Tattoos, Eyelash Extensions, and Brow and Lash Tinting. I had Sarah take care of me. At first, I was kinda iffy because the girl she did before me was in tears with a puffy red face!?!?\u000a\u000aWhy??? She was a first timer...couldn't be more than 13 years old, dragged mom with her, and she wanted to do it...Youngins these days, that's the price you pay for beauty, right? No fault on Sarah's part, just a little girl tryin' to be all grown up.\u000a\u000aMy turn is up, and Sarah does her magic, first with the little brow comb and scissors, a snip here and there, then on to the threading. Assisting her a couple of times and after about 5 minutes, Voila!!! Sarah has that ability to keep Men's brows neat and clean without looking feminine which is a big plus, then later finishes your brows with a little astringent and lotion to soothe your pain(if you have any) at $10, this is the cheapest in town, and the quality of work is better than those other threading joints. .\u000a\u000aYeah, you can save money like Geico, but you'll also look like the Geico Caveman, and no one wants to be rocking the unibrow or Velcro strip on their face. At least I wouldn't..\u000aThere were three other women after me, all waiting for Sarah....go see her, she knows what she's doing...ALOHA!!!

VWe can agree to disagree, but as far as frozen custard goes in Vegas, Luv-It is still custard king(since 1973)...not Nielsen's, not Mr.D's(and Sheridan's before that), and most definitely not CJ's.\u000a\u000aCustomer service was pretty lacking, no service with a smile, and the girl who helped me behind the counter was VERY enthusiastic about selling CJ's to me...I'm kidding!\u000aYou could actually hear a pin drop, thats how quiet it was as she waited for me with a blank stare to place my order. I just ordered a vanilla custard with heath toffee bits-pretty plane jane...\u000a\u000aJust drive to the corner and get yourself some Thrifty's Ice Cream...better service too..ALOHA!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(300/365) "Service Without a Smile...:("

Now people can enjoy their tasty curry and sport their cool threads as well....Win-Win situation!

VAs good as it gets folks...fellow yelpers didn't steer me wrong! New York, Chicago, Napoletana, I like it all, I don't have a personal preference or style, as long as its done right!\u000a\u000aTyler does his pizzas right and doesn't take no shortcuts and it shows in the end result.\u000awe ordered a half White with mushrooms and basil, and a half Pepperoni, salami, and pineapple, Both halves were equally good and the crust was crisp and chewy at the same time without going soggy. \u000a\u000aI like that sense of community displayed there as well. Children from the dance studio next door pop in for a drink after class and other neighborhood kids come by to hang out and even help him fold pizza boxes. Tyler treats them as if they were his own, and you rarely see that these days.\u000a\u000aBe sure to check-in before you place your order so you can receive 50% of a large pizza. I found that out after our pizza was in the oven. We'll return anyways so I don't feel like too much of a dork.....ALOHA!!!

One of the workers pulled up a code on wifey's phone that she could always use with every visit and receive 40% off...thought that was pretty cool of her, knowing that some things in here can cost a pretty penny.\u000a\u000aThe sections with model cars and posters were neat, and the case full of Krylon spray paint brought back memories of my mischieveous teen years...;)   ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(88/100) "Michael's Cousin"

VAfter having dinner at Big Wong, we look across and notice the Volcano Tea House.Not too sure if they're associated with the other Volcano Tea down the street (says they're from LA), but as we stepped inside, they were literally JUST opening! (see photo...sign says "opening now" LOL!) The room(which was strangely hot) is just a few tables and chairs and pretty bare walls with little pictures and phrases. Their menu looks similar to Tea Planet offering hot, milk, iced, and snow options. Two sizes are offered (reg, Lg.) and prices start at $3 for reg. size(didn't see what they charged for Large)\u000a\u000aAlthough you could still see the "opening day jitters" of the staff, they were very nice and helpful. The guy helping us suggested we try the house milk tea, so wifey got that, and I ordered a coconut milk tea. He also let us know that from now through April 22nd, You get a free smoothie with a purchase of a milk tea-SWEET! So the guy suggested I try the Mango Smoothie and wifey ordered a Grape Smoothie. Wifey's Milk Tea was nice, refreshing, and not overly sweet. My Coconut Milk Tea tasted more like Almond Milk Tea. It was okay(maybe one of the workers made Almond by mistake?)\u000a\u000aMy Mango Smoothie comes out and they inform us that Grape is not yet available, so wifey just gets another House Milk Tea. The Mango smoothie was very good, and hopefully these guys do well and work out the kinks with all of the other established competitors that are in this area...ALOHA!!! \u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(222/365)  "2 For 1 Drinks"\u000a\u000a**YELP HEADQUARTERS - PLEASE ADJUST ADDRESS TO 5020 LIKE I NOTIFIED A WEEK AGO...NOTHING STILL HASN'T BEEN CHANGED!

Pretty weak. we met up with other yelpers inside and shot some pool awaiting the arrival of hostess Julie K.-Thanks for hosting Julie!!!\u000a\u000aCool atmosphere here and cool activities to keep you occupied-bowling, gamer's room, pool tables, and a bar tended by men in undies and ladies in drag, and a nightly show or two put on by the ladies. Didn't drink, bowl, or hit up the gamer's room, but there's always next time!\u000a\u000aIf you're ever in the downtown area, come down and check out Drink and Drag...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(24/100) "Chilaxin' @ Double D"

VTo all the TRUE Sushitarians, This one's for you....FINALLY!!!!! A JAPANESE RESTAURANT THAT SERVES EDOMAE STYLE SUSHI!!!!!!\u000a\u000aNo, I'm not talking about krab, cream cheese, and yum-yum sauced creations better known as Western Style sushi, but the traditional authentic style sushi you would find in Japan. Thanks yet again to Takashi Segawa, the President/Owner of the Mon Restaurant Group (Sushi Mon on Maryland Parkway,Monta Ramen, and Goyemon), locals and visitors can finally experience Kabuto which has been in the works for the past three years.\u000a\u000aI immediately phoned in after finding info through the Yelp App to see if they had any openings, and WHADDAYAKNOW??? There was an opening at 6pm at the bar! Must be my lucky day!?!?!?! I get there promptly at 6pm, and give the waitress my name, and a guy at the bar says "Nelson?" "Yes", I reply and I assume and guess wrongly that he was Alex S.(Yelp Las Vegas' Authority on Japanese Cuisine) and it was none other than Yelp Las Vegas' resident jokester, Hootie B. So we "talk story" a bit in anticipation of our dinner, about the Vegas food scene, and how we were both excited to see the slow transformation of Vegas' "Japantown", and to tell you the truth, Hootie's good people.....\u000a\u000aThe atmosphere and ambiance is somewhat minimalist in a good way...you won't find TV's with the game going on, or top 40 music blasting through the speakers, etc. the staff at Kabuto really pride themselves on tradition here, and that is evident in the beautiful cypress wood countertop/bar without your typical refrigerated showcase, the necessary tools, dishes and ingredients needed to execute such perfection.\u000a\u000aOnly the best available fish and seafood are served here. Absolutely no frozen fish whatsoever, and Ingredients are delivered direct from the world's best regions. As far as the menu selections go, you may order a la carte, do the Nigiri Tasting ($48)\u000aand in the future, a chef's "Omakase" ($80). At the time, the Omakase wasn't available since it was a "Soft Opening" for friends and family, so I went with the Nigiri Dinner.\u000a\u000aI also got one of the best seats in the place, directly in front of the sushi chef which was where all the action took place.\u000a\u000aAfter checking with my server of any possible allergies and sushi preferences,\u000aI clean my hands with the hot towel that is provided, and a black plate(Slate!?!?)\u000ais placed on the ledge in front of me where I will recieve my nigiri one by one.\u000aDO NOT PLACE THIS IN FRONT OF YOU...IT IS TO REMAIN THERE THROUGHOUT THE DURATION OF THE MEAL...THIS IS THE WAY IT IS TRADITIONALLY DONE.\u000a\u000aMy dinner begins with a PINEAPPLE SAKE APPERITIF. Aged for 100 days in house, this went down smoothly and warmed my body. the chef also informed me that they will be rotating flavors in the future.I'm not a big sake fan, but this was delicious! My appetizer was SEA SNAIL AND GEODUCK CLAM WITH CUCUMBER, RADISH, ENOKI, AND MISO DRESSING. The sweetness and crunch of the sea snail and clam paired well with the dressing and fresh vegetables.\u000a\u000aMy 10 pieces of excellence were SUZUKI, GIANT CLAM, BABY AMBERJACK, CHERRY SALMON, TORO,SNAPPER, IKURA, OPAL EYE, OH-TORO, AND ANAGO.\u000aThe chef will decide what type of nigiri he thinks you will enjoy. If you read the other reviews, no one recieved the same exact thing. The Chef also adds fresh wasabi to each piece of nigiri and brushes 3-year aged shoyu or the accompanying sauce on each piece, tells you what it is and where it comes from and sets it on your plate. At this point, you are to consume each piece entirely(not multiple bites) while the rice is still at body temperature either by using chopsticks or your hands. A cool looking wooden cup with a wet towel will be provided for those using their hands. The ginger is not to be passed up either. It is crisp, sweet and has a nice heat to it(I'm assuming it is made in house as well) and was a great palate cleanser between each nigiri and digestive aid as well.\u000a\u000aAfter the 10 piece chef's choice, he will offer you more nigiri or a handroll. I chose a handroll and the chef made one with TORO. I also added MISO SOUP which was also chef recommended. Using both red and white miso, this came with a piece of bone-in fish that the server called a "rare deep sea fish." Great flavor and very tasty...\u000a\u000aDessert choices that are all made in house were Mango Sorbet, Chocolate Mousse, Layered Crepes with Strawberry Sauce and the highly suggested MOCHI ICE CREAM.\u000aThe green tea, vanilla, and peanut butter mochi were a great ending to an exceptional meal.\u000a\u000aRemember, you will never find any cream cheese stuffed, mayo baked, or yum-yum laced creations here...if you're a "roll" person and not big on nigiri or have no clue what it is, Kabuto is not for you...ALOHA!!! \u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(225/365) "  My Excellent Edomae Experience"

VThis place is like the Home Depot or Bed Bath and Beyond for neat freaks and the doctor for hoarders and those who need to organize and do a clean sweep of their belongings.\u000a\u000aThe Container Store has just about anything you need to live neat, clean, and clutter free.\u000aAside from having containers of various shapes and forms that'll make life easier, their shelving systems were cool, the bungee style chairs were very comfortable, and they even have the exact French style mason jars that Bouchon uses for their Foie Gras and Salmon Rillettes.\u000a\u000aI also have a lot of collectibles that I want to display, and they have cool shelves and containers that could come in real handy. Some of these items cost a pretty penny though. That "kid in the candy store" effect could take over and you could rack up your bill before you know it!...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(284/365) "Contain Yourself !!!"

VHairstylists....they are hard to find...and when you find one...its hard to keep a good, consistent one. Lately, my stylist has been AWOL, and I needed a cut pretty bad! I had to find a place and QUICK! I was kinda nervous though, because there have been times I walked out with my hair butchered, and even one time bald like Mr. Clean!(True story!), just out of desperation to get my hair did, and I didn't want that to happen again...\u000a\u000aWarren P. had mentioned Hi-Rollers located on E Charleston and Maryland Parkway to me a while back, and since we were heading in that direction, I decided to check Hi-Rollers out. Next door to the Huntridge Pharmacy, Hi Rollers is definitely a hidden gem. Those who know about it know what to expect. I've been to Hi-Rollers on three occasions, and I've been more than pleased each and every time. Love the vibe as you step inside, as if you went back in time to a shop of the 50s and 60's, cool pieces from Martin's personal collection and gifts decorate the walls(LOVE the Loteria cards and the Corona street sign which is Wifey's maiden name and Martin's last name!? Hmmmm...maybe they're related???)\u000a\u000aThe foursome of Martin, Chris, Caynen, and Chops make up the team at Hi-Rollers, with Levi being the shop keeper sweeping up, and making sure all supplies stocked up and replenished at all times. Being in business since 2010, these guys have earned a great reputation of being some of the best barbers in the business and it shows with each and every haircut. These guys even got their own sense of style every Tuesday and Saturday which are "Dapper Days". Yeah, they've gotten a write up in the Las Vegas Weekly, and were seen on Counting Cars and Pawn Stars, but after all the publicity, these guys still remain down to earth which is huge. This is not your usual "turn and burn" "meet a  certain quota" kind of establishment. These guys don't watch the clock. Instead, they're busy chatting up a storm among themselves and their clients just like you'd see in barber shop style movies which ALWAYS makes for a great time. Just know that if flicks like Blood In Blood Out, American Me, Rush Hour or Goodfellas are playing on the TV, your haircut/wait time will just take that much longer, but its all good. I'm sure if they had their own TV show it would be HILARIOUS! Like many say, its definitely worth the wait. Even the line out the door before they even open is proof. \u000a\u000aTheir hours are Tue.-Fri. 9 am-5 pm, and Sat. 9 am-4 pm(Closed Sunday, Monday and the first Tuesday of every month) and the best advice I can give you is get here early, and if you are #5 in line, you will have at least a 30 minute wait. (There are only four chairs, and four barbers) They do not take appointments or credit cards, so bring cash, grab a little bite to eat, and expect to spend a good couple hours of your day here. Another important thing to remember is to know who came before you, and who came after you. You don't pick numbers, just know your order. You may move up a bit quicker if someone has a certain barber they are waiting on. Haircuts start at $15 with fades starting at $19 and includes a warm cream/straight razor shave and a hot towel finish. This awesome experience is at least a minimum of 30-45 minutes and everyone I've seen walk out after being cut is totally satisfied. This is also your one stop shop for all your pomade needs to keep your wig tight where you can find top brands like Suavecito, Layrite, and Shiner Gold. Seriously some of the sweetest pompadours and side parts  I've seen.\u000a\u000aFellas, if you're searching for a spot that cuts, blends, shaves, and fades like nobody's business, you may want to check out Hi-Rollers. Highly recommended!!!   ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  5\u000a\u000a*Saturday hours are now 9am-4pm\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(44/365) "The Best Barbers in the Business"

VPosted pics but didn't follow up with a review.....OOOOPS!\u000a\u000aAnywho, when I check out most pizza places for the first time, I almost use their White Pizza as a test. Some people love the concept here, and they pile everything but the kitchen sink onto their personal creation.\u000a\u000aFor me, I like my pies simple and straightforward. Less is more IMO when i comes to pizza. No more than three toppings, any more than that, your tastebuds will be confused!\u000a\u000aSo I get my white pizza and I gotta say I wasn't a fan of the alfredo sauce on my pizza.\u000aLinguini Alfredo? Yes. White pizza with alfredo?...meh...Least I can say I've been here, done that, but with places like Rocco's, Novecento, and Settebello, I'd rather pay for their white pies which I feel are more enjoyable.

VThis place was PACKED when we got here...Wifey placed our orders, I went ahead and snagged a table just as a party was on their way out. Perfect timing!\u000a\u000aThey have alot to choose from here-Wifey chose a cheeseburger combo with a chili-cheese fries upgrade and I went with a patty melt combo. Both were very tasty and well seasoned, but  the patties could be a little thicker. \u000a\u000aI love their skinny mini fries. they were all perfectly cooked and a generous portion too.\u000aGive the Chili-Cheese Fries extra love by hitting them with some Cholula action...The staff and service is great here, and another cool thing is you can order dessert with your meal and put it on hold. When you're ready for dessert, go up and hand a cashier your receipt, or one of the staff will be nice enough to get it for you after bussing your table.\u000a\u000aWe shared the Turtle and PBC & B(Peanut Butter Cup and Banana) Sundaes. They were good, and the consistency of the custard was smooth and creamy. Overall, a good first visit and we'll definitely be back...ALOHA!!!

VJust one week later, I'm back here getting my Malassada fix. I picked up a red velvet with chocolate filling, one with green tea filling, and another one filled with macadamia nut cream. I also got a slice of the green tea cake, but unfortunately, Rudy's signature Guava Glazed Chicken had already sold out.\u000a\u000aAll the treats were delicious as always, and hopefully next time, I'll be able to snag an order of Rudy's specials. Future plans also include dessert items at Thelma's  and Filipino specialties like Lumpia. Thanks again to the 808 ohana for curing our cravings for some ono grindz!...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(305/365) "Hana Hou @ 808"

Y'ALL MISSED OUT!!!!\u000a\u000aNo endless lines, no long wait, no shortage of food this time! ALL booths were prepared for those attending. The turnout this year was lower, partly due to the fact that it was kinda chaotic last year when the crowd outnumbered the food supply. Once we got in, mixed drinks from BOMBAY SAPPHIRE were handed out, I got a free shirt from the ladies from ASAHI BEER, and our LuckyRice gluttonfest began! Here are the various bites and booze we got to partake in:\u000a\u000aAKIRA BACK, YELLOWTAIL, LAS VEGAS\u000aAkira Back Tuna Tartare and Baked Crab Handrolls...meh\u000a\u000aANDY RICKER, POK POK, PORTLAND & NYC\u000aKhanom Jiin Naam Phrik-Thin Rice Vermicelli with Southern Thai Curry of Coconut, Cream, Prawns,Toasted Mung Beans, and Chili-Garlic Oil\u000a(**3-way tie for best noodle dish...killed two of these!)\u000a\u000aANTHONY MEIDENBAUER, HOLSTEIN'S, LAS VEGAS\u000aBahn Mi Street Taco-Braised Pork Belly, Kimchee Slaw, and Spicy Mayo-YUM!\u000aMango-Lime Pudding with Sesame Crispies, Almond Cake,and Miso Caramel-YUM!\u000a\u000aBANK ATCHARAWAN, CHADA THAI, LAS VEGAS\u000aHousemade Crab Curry with Rice Noodles\u000aSpicy Herb Spring Roll-Both dishes were good with alot of HEAT!\u000a\u000aBROOKE WILLIAMSON, THE TRIPEL & HUDSON HOUSE, LOS ANGELES\u000aChilled Tapioca Noodle Salad with Sweet Marinated Black Soybeans, Ground Rock Shrimp and Pork, Green Papaya, Chili Oil, Mint, Thai Basil, and Black Puffed Rice.

VCelebrating Asian culinary culture, Lucky Rice made its inaugural debut in Las Vegas at The Boulevard Pool Deck at The Cosmopolitan. This year's line up included chefs specializing in Asian cuisine locally, natioinally, and internationally.\u000a\u000aI passed on local offerings from Lotus, Fuku, and RAKU, because they were offering things we have already tried and it would also give us more of a chance to sample the cuisines from guest chefs instead. We were able to sample about two thirds of the total offerings by nights end. Our gluttonfest went a little something like this: \u000a\u000aAnthony Meidenbauer, HOLSTEIN'S, Las Vegas, NV\u000aThai Pork Slider with Asian Slaw, Thai Basil, and Coconut Curry Aioli\u000aPandan Cupcake with Coconut Cream\u000a\u000aShirley Chung, CHINA POBLANO, Las Vegas, NV\u000aPork Ribs with Mole Amarillo, Corn Nuts and Escabeche\u000aRo Jia Mo Street Sandwich with Red Braised Pork Belly\u000aSalt Air Margarita\u000a\u000aStephen Hopcraft, STK, Las Vegas, NV\u000aShortrib Potsticker with Scallion and Wasabi Jus\u000a\u000aEddie Huang, BAOHAUS, NYC\u000aSous Vide Char Siu Pork Bao with Cucumber, Cilantro, Tsa Tsai, Shwan Tsai, Taiwanese Red Sugar, and Crushed Peanuts\u000a\u000aPaul Qui, Top Chef Texas Winner\u000aUCHIKO, Austin, TX\u000aSunchoke Dashi with Summer Vegetables and Bottarga\u000a\u000aCharles Phan, SLANTED DOOR, San Francisco, CA\u000aGarlic Beef Rolls, Thai Basil, and Housemade Sriracha\u000a\u000aSang Yoon, LUKSHON, Los Angeles, CA\u000aCured Hawaiian Butterfish, Watermelon Radish, Nahm Jim, Rau Ram\u000aSichuan Lamb Tartare, Preserved Chiles, Prickly Ash, Cilantro, and Puffed Black Rice\u000a**BEST BITES OF THE EVENING**\u000a\u000aAri Kolender, RED MEDICINE, Los Angeles, CA\u000aChicken Dumpling on Butter Lettuce, Caramelized Sugar, Pork Fat, and Lemongrass Confiture\u000a\u000aAngelo Sosa, Top Chef All-Star\u000aSOCIAL EATZ, NYC\u000aSashimi of Fluke with Bone Marrow and Parmesan Reggiano\u000a\u000aJet Tila\u000aTHE CHARLESTON, Los Angeles, CA\u000aBraised Short rib Taco, with Brussels Sprouts and Kochujang Salsa-Ran Out :(\u000aCrispy Pork Belly Buns with Japanese Pickle\u000a\u000aWe also got to try some of the drink concoctions:\u000a\u000aCorzo Thai Pulled Tea\u000aFit to be Thai'd\u000aLucky Number\u000aLemonade from Ty-Ku\u000a\u000aSweet Endings @ NEAPOLITAN\u000a**Non Alcoholic Popsicles**\u000aPour Some Sugar On Me-Peach popsicle dipped in brown sugar crumble\u000aGetting Drunk in the Rain-Coconut and Pineapple topped with pop rocks\u000aThe Watermelon Patch-Watermelon and lime with cucumber\u000a\u000a**Smoothies**\u000aNeapolitan\u000aPeanut Butter, Chocolate, Banana, and Bacon.\u000a\u000aOverall, not a bad deal thanks to Groupon!

VThis place is a collector's candy store.Wifey likes to collect vintage hats and I like to search for all types of food collectibles, and cool vintage toys. This place has it all.\u000a\u000aThe place is clean, and the workers are very helpful. You can even still bargain with them to get a sweet deal on an item you may have your eye on.\u000a\u000aClothes, bikes, jewelry, toys, etc. Some guy even bought a huge Michael Jordan Statue!\u000aIts always cool to check out these kinds of places. It'll not only take you down memory lane, but you may find something that has sentimental value and you'll be happy you stopped in!...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(335/365) " Retro Vintage Junk!?!?"

VSo sorry, but after spending about 3 years back east, I ain't no expert, but I've had my share of Italian Ice/water ice and I can honestly remember it being smoother and more flavorful. Rita's version is a slightly watered down and less flavorful ice.\u000a\u000aThe customer service here is stellar. Service with a smile, samples to try to help you decide, but unfortunately for me, the quality and the products used just fall short.\u000aWifey got a Small Cherry Ice, and I played it safe and got a small Mango Orange ice with Vanilla Custard to get that "Creamsicle" like taste...first taste, no, second try, nope, third try...not only was it watered down, the custard was off...\u000aThe custard was also the lowest quality I have ever tasted, like frozen Cool Whip!?!?\u000a\u000aEven Freddy's, CJ's, and Nielsen's custards are better, but Luv-It is still king of custard.\u000aLuckily I got a small, because I didn't finish which is very rare for me. I even tried a few spoonfuls of wifey's cherry ice, and it tasted and smelled like I was eating one of those cherry air fresheners.. That too, was a small, and that too wasn't finished...Like they say, to each his own...Stop by and give Rita's a try. For me, it just wasn't my cup of tea, I mean ice and custard....ALOHA!!!

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(130/365) "The Master Masseuse"\u000a\u000aGo See Kevin!!! NOW!!!!!!!!\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOh yeah, no one liners allowed! But fo' really tho'.....you want a high end massage without getting a WWE style smackdown(Refer to my Best Foot Spa Review) Thanks to Regina, we had a very relaxing day! Kevin is really great about explaining to you what's gonna happen, step by step so there's no surprises. He first has you face down and then you inhale a scented oil to get your senses going, Then he goes to work checking on you periodically to ensure that a comfortable amount of pressure is being given making sure your body is at ease during your session. Oils are also used on your body which are very soothing and smell great.\u000a\u000aOne of my favorite parts were the hot rock treatment. Rocks are heated to 170 degrees then cooled to the proper working temperature of 140 degrees and Kevin uses them to work your entire back region. After flipping around, Kevin did some work on my arms, hands, legs, and feet. Upon completion, Wifey and I swapped places, and I went in to finish off with a steam/shower...AHHHHHHHHH!!!!\u000a\u000aPersonal lockers, a robe, and flip flops are provided, as well as complimentary water, and with very competitive reasonable pricing, we definitely will return! ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  5

VThis is another one of those places that I decided to give the "benefit of the doubt" and yes, I'm not impressed....Totally MEH!\u000aAs mentioned in various reviews, great concept, but the execution falls short. Cookies are baked in big batches and  left out uncovered(health code violation?) ending up hard  and cold...pretty tiny too!\u000aBite into the cold, hard cookie and your cold ice cream spills out the sides....FAIL!\u000a\u000aNothing is better than a properly made WARM, SOFT cookie sandwich with COLD ice cream...you have ovens and more than enough employees to change up your execution a bit...totally missing out on the temperature/texture contrast that WILL get people coming back for more. Don't take my word for it, CREAM in Berkley, CA has the same concept executed flawlessly-warm, bigger cookies out of the oven, with TWO scoops of ice cream for only $2!!!! No wonder they have a line out the door on a daily basis! They do it RIGHT.\u000a\u000aI'm just being honest and telling it like it is, and when you have great ingredients, equipment, and labor to do it right, it is very disappointing when the end product is what you get here. I'll just stick to doing it my way, the right way...I got Thrifty close by in Aliante and I always keep cookie dough in the freezer...:p    ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(76/100) "Unsweetened Addiction"

VWhat a win-win situation this was! Benefiting St.Jude's, attendees got to live a chocoholic's dream for an evening and indulge in all the chocolate, sweets and cocktails created by some of the worlds top pastry chefs. Aside from their offerings, a silent auction was going on and each station had a Carnivale-inspired mask made out of chocolate and/or sugar that would later be auctioned off to the highest bidder, and the proceeds would also go to St.Jude's.\u000a\u000aHere's how the sugar rush went down:\u000a\u000aCAKE BUZZ\u000a\u000aAt first glance, you would have thought Chef Sean Allen was a personal trainer, not a pastry chef. His wine and liqueur infused cakes were a hit with the crowd, and I decided to get a bite of his Twilight Cake which was infused with Francis Ford Coppola Cabernet. Not overly sweet, and very moist.\u000a\u000aJEAN-MARIE AUBOINE CHOCOLATIER\u000aJINJU CHOCOLATES\u000aSTEPHANE TREAND\u000a\u000aChefs Jean-marie Auboine and Jin Caldwell provided a great assortment of Bonbons, Nougat, and Caramels, and Stephane Treand gave attendees a taste of three different chocolates frome three different parts of the world ( Hilo,Hawaii, The Ivory Coast, and Trinidad and Tobago) That went from cocoa bean to chocolate bar production in one facility.\u000a\u000aCACAO BARRY/CALLEBAUT served up mini chocolate root beer floats while CHAMBORD mixed up a tasty concoction of their own...SWEET RUBY JANE CONFECTIONS served an upscale version of violet crumble and had a lawn full of cake pops. Treats on a stick continued as Chef Carlos Salazar of CAESAR'S PALACE had a spread of his own-chocolate dipped oreos, cheesecakes and cake pops.\u000a\u000aPUUR CHOCOLAT\u000a\u000aChef Ramon Perez was one of my favorite stops. His Agumi Sea Salt Caramels and Passionfruit Bonbons with Basil Seed were very good, as was his mini plated dessert of Soft Guayaquil Chocolate with Black Sesame Seeds, Micro Greens,Passionfruit Gel and Yuzu Koshi Ice Cream...my favorite bite of the evening.\u000a\u000aPATRON packed a coffee and chocolate punch with their shots, and BOMBAY SAPPHIRE had interactive gin and tonic stations, and were handing out $10 bills for taking their survey(no joke!)\u000a\u000aTHE GOODIE GIRLS had a delicious Blueberry Pancake Cupcake as well as sweet push-pops, Gil Morales of THE ORLEANS had a killer Chocolate bread pudding, pastry students of OREGON CULINARY INSTITUE served up a petite Chocolate Crunch Cake with Raspberry Coulis, cosmopolitan popsicles were being passed out by Sno-Bar, and Chefs from LUXOR/EXCALIBUR put out a triple threat of Chocolate Pistachio Mousse, Vanilla Panna Cotta with Berry Compote and Popping Boba, and a Chocolate Passion Drink.\u000a\u000aChef Gianni Gihanghi of the MANDARIN ORIENTAL served a decadent Flourless Chocolate Cake with Salted Dulce De Leche and Cocoa Crumble, \u000aand another one of my favorite stops, the queens of the cupcake scene, PICK YOUR POISON had Banana Cream Pie, Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, and Spiked Arnold Palmer Cupcakes, Get Loopy Lollipops, and Not Yo Mama's Pudding. BEST cupcakes in town without a doubt!\u000a\u000aAwesome evening and looking forward to next year!....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(316/365) "I Want Candy!!!"

V** EDIT-The Chef is gone, but the Shortribs and Speciality Burgers are still available**\u000a\u000aIf you haven't yet, you have ONE more day to check Paparazzi Grill out...:(\u000a\u000aWe ordered the Croque Mad Ham-Sourdough french toast, black forest ham, two eggs over easy, and bechamel-really delicious!\u000a\u000aWe used our Yelp Check-In (Free Speciality Burger with a purchase of $10)\u000aand Got the popular Mad Max Burger-Braised shortrib and cremini mushrooms on an angus beef patty on a pretzel roll. Burgers are huge and filling.\u000a\u000aSo bummed that they are closing up shop on January 21st(monday) heard lots of great things about other food items and the pictures look great too. but due to lack of business, Yelpers have one last chance tomorrow, Sunday January 20th to try one of Las Vegas' short-lived hidden gems....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(16/100) " Adios Paparazzi"

VTrash or treasures? Well, it all depends on what you consider garbage or a good find.\u000a\u000aGoodwill has been a great source to grab pants, tops, or accessories for Elite events. (I spied a Members Only Jacket in the aisles that would be perfect for an 80's throwback event!) when its time to dress up, and I've been lucky enough to score a baker's rack that was still sealed in the box.\u000a\u000aThe framed artwork section may have some cool pieces that catch your eye. I almost snagged a sweet Star Wars framed puzzle, but my smile slowly turned to sorrow upon close inspection when I saw it was damaged by mold on the bottom...NOOOOOOO!!!!\u000a\u000aI'm always on the lookout on vintage toys and collectibles, cookbooks, and all kinds of cool collectibles chef/food related. No cookbook finds this time, but I did score Chef from South Park still sealed in the package....Wooohooo! You just never know what you may find here at Goodwill!.......ALOHA!!!

VWith a plethora of food choices in this town(yes, we have MANY) there's a chance that you may have an occasional food fart...you know, kinda like a brain fart???? Okay, enough about farting....as I was trying to explain, Presto Caf falls under the\u000a"healthier" category along with Rachel's Kitchen, Greens and Proteins, Skinnyfats, etc...\u000a\u000aWe've never been, so we decided to have a looksee and lunchy. I didn't even look at the menu yet, but I saw the Pide(pee-day) next to their salads and it looked like a distant cousin to the Armenian Adjarsky served at Manan Bakery. The worker said that the Greek Pide was the most popular, so I was already sold on that.\u000a\u000aWifey got a Turkey Sandwich on Cranberry-Walnut bread which was very delicious and the lady was nice enough to give her some tasty Black Bean-Corn Salad too!\u000aOverall, a great first visit, and most definitely not our last...ALOHA!!!

VWe stumbled upon Dip Sticks while picking up move tickets at Galaxy. The lady who helped us behind the counter was very personable and gave us a little tour of their selections.\u000a\u000aCupcakes, Cakepops, Banana Pudding, Brownies, and STUFFED COOKIES! We decide to share a chocolate chip cookie stuffed with a nice hunk of Snickers inside.\u000aSo chewy and still slightly warm from being right out of the oven, simple, but so good, I was instantly thinking....Got Milk???.\u000a\u000aAs we were leaving. The lady  says "How about a cupcake for the road? We have Banana Pecan and Peanut Butter Cup...Which one would you like? I was thinking uh-oh, where's the camera..am I being Punk'd right now? I didn't have to worry be cause she was just providing excellent customer service and this was their way of saying "Thank You for stopping in"...Well, we are glad we did!    ALOHA!!!

VAfter the Alzheimer's Walk, we opted for an American breakfast and since we've hit up Du-Pars quite a few times when we're in the downtown area, we decided to check out Eat after the rave reviews from fellow yelpers.\u000a\u000aChef Natalie Young has helped re-ignite the downtown area by giving people a hip trendy spot to start their day. As you step inside, it makes you feel like you're not in the desert, but somewhere in the Bay Area or even NYC. Serving breakfast and lunch, The menu items at Eat definitely has something for everyone. We decided on the Huevos Montulenos and the Downtown Benedict (Served on the weekends only)\u000a\u000aOur server was very attentive and offered suggestions as well as answered any \u000aquestions we had before making our decision, and kept our coffee mugs full with the tasty coffee from the Colorado River Roasting Company-YUM!\u000a\u000aThe Huevos Montulenos is layered with tons of flavor-a tortilla with sweet peas, black beans, saltiness from feta cheese, more added sweetness from bananas(not sweet plantains) covered with two fried eggs and topped with a nice heat from the christmas sauce(AKA salsa rojo y salsa verde) served with a mound of potatoes. The benedict was kinda small in portion size but definitely made up in flavor with the wheat english muffin, turkey bacon sauteed spinach and two perfectly poached eggs that oozes out as you cut into it. Being in the food biz, I can tell whether a place cuts corners, but the hollandaise sauce is the real deal Hollyfield folks...it is dangerously good!\u000a\u000aIf you happen to be in the area, stop by for a tasty bite. You will not be disappointed!\u000aLooking forward to returning to try Chef Natalie's other creations...ALOHA!!!

VThe "Flies on s@#t" effect is totally evident here, being that this is the newer, born-again buffet in town and USA Today has recently given the following rankings of the top buffets in Las Vegas:\u000a\u000a1) Bacchanal Buffet, Caesar's Palace\u000a\u000a2) Buffet at Bellagio, Bellagio\u000a\u000a3) Buffet at Wynn, Wynn\u000a\u000a4) Studio B Buffet, M Casino\u000a\u000a5) Wicked Spoon Buffet, The Cosmopolitan\u000a\u000aThe decor looks pretty cool, kinda like the Wicked Spoon had a three-way with Studio B and The Container Store, and VOILA!!! \u000a\u000aWe arrived between Lunch/Dinner and I checked out the whole set-up and snapped photos of almost every possible selection offered that evening before grubbin'...Here's a little rundown of MY perspective of things...\u000a\u000aSEAFOOD-Pretty familiar set-up like other spots in town...Cocktail Shrimp, Green Mussels, Oysters, SWEET King Crab like Bellagio and Wynn, Snow Crab, and no Stone Crab.\u000aHot and cold seafood preparations as well.Gazpacho, Seafood salad, and Oyster Shooter were pretty bland, calamari was rubbery, Passed on the Oysters-Looked old, and sunken in instead of plump and fresh. Lobster Corn Chowder and Shrimp and Grits were okay.\u000a\u000aAMERICAN/CARVING STATIONS-good comfort foods...perfect mini sliders, mini baskets of fried goodness-wings, fish and chips,chicken tenders, fried chicken, potato skins, onion rings, etc. Carving station had a similar set-up as well, your usual sides and meats...Prime Rib, Sausage, Turkey, Ribs, Brisket, Steamship Round, etc. Tomahawk Steaks and Lamb Chops were a cool addition. Lamb was one of my faves, Tomahawk slices were unfortunately full of fat and gristle.\u000a\u000a\u000aMEXICAN/ITALIAN STATIONS-again, your familiar selections(Pizza, Pasta, Tacos, Pozole, etc.not really anything to set them apart from the rest, I snapped photos, but decided not to fill up on items from these stations.\u000a\u000aINFUSED HONEY/CHEESE/CHARCUTERIE/ARTISINAL BREADS-Already a winning combo of tasty cheeses,charcuterie, and breads, do not pass up the infused honey which ties everything else in very nicely.\u000a\u000aSALADS/ASIAN STATION-The Watermelon and Feta Salad was good, and the Tonkotsu Ramen was pretty good for being at a buffet . I was curious about the Ginseng Chicken, which was slightly bitter and medicinal...first and last time trying this one! Passed up the rest of the store looking sushi, stir-frys, and salads...again, familiar stuff like all the other buffets, nothing to set themselves apart, no wow factor, nada....\u000a\u000aDESSERTS-Lots of eye candy with the spread here...Favorites were the Baklava Ice Cream, and the simplicity of a warm crepe made to order. Sorbets were more like an icy granita and lacked the smooth texture a sorbet should have, the Blackberry Panna Cotta glass was way more gelatinous than Jello. Of course, your standard cakes, pies, tarts, cupcakes, etc....99% of buffet goers would easily snatch up French Macarons, and I'm part of that 1% that could easily decline with no regrets.\u000a\u000aOverall, 3.5 Stars.... Cool, sleek, modern spacious look that seems to have taken up the majority of the 17 million dollar investment, I was expecting the food to be on a more elevated level, outshining the competition on the strip, but that wasn't the case here. I honestly have had better first impressions at Studio B, Wynn, and Wicked Spoon, when those buffets first opened. 500 globally inspired dishes doesn't mean better....Sometimes less is more.\u000a\u000aWill The Bacchanal Buffet be able to hold on to the top spot? Only time will tell....ALOHA!!!

VHaving seen every Cirque and Cirque-like Show(Oh, except Believe-even though we had complimentary tickets) Zarkana was a great show overall...There was a week-long promotion leading up to the launch of Zarkana in the Aria EDR(employee dining room). So we got a sneek peak of the show and its characters so we weren't completely left in the dark.\u000a\u000aTHE STORYLINE\u000a\u000aTaking place in an abandoned theater, Zark is a magician who has lost his magic, and also his love, Lia. While begging the gods for her return, he encounters a few seducing creatures along the way(The Pickled Lady- a result of one of the mad scientists' experiments, Mandragora- an incarnation of the Ivy growing wild, Kundalini- The Snake Woman, and Tarantula- The Spider Woman... . Zarkana is a fusion of two words: bizarre and arcana, which explains the strange aura and atmosphere of this place, and those who live in this world. The language spoken is referred to as"Cirquish"....That jibberish is present in just about all the other CDC shows as well....No, its not French, Italian, etc........ now you know the storyline as well as not having to guess what language they are speaking...GET IT??? GOT IT??? GOOD!!!!!\u000a\u000aThe Jovians were cool with their acrobatics using their"personal" silver hoops(crafted  to work only with their own bodies and nobody elses) and the Oracle created amazing visions of sand in a matter of seconds!\u000a\u000aAcrobatics, aerial acts, feats of strength and of course comedy did not disappoint either-juggling, the ladder trio, tightrope duet synchronized flags, hand balancing guy(cool handspins and a crazy hollowback freeze!) trapeeze acts, the cyr wheel act (Like KA) and the Russian Bar and Banquine Troop had spectators gasping and at the edge of our seats throughout the performance.\u000a\u000aI think some reviews are being a little too critical and need to take a chill pill. Its no one's fault but yours going in blind and not doing some research before attending a performance!\u000a\u000aBig Mahalo to The Cirque Du Soleil Family for bringing another show to Las Vegas and to all the cast members for giving 100% with every performance.....ALOHA!!!!

VThis was the last stop on the 3-UYE tour. We haven't been back ever since Nerdy Dancing 2, so we were ready to dance the night away. At the door, we ran into Fellow Yelper Nikki H. and her man, and we navigated the crowd to see where the rest of our party was hanging out. \u000a\u000aWe met up with Justin, Janel, Erica, and Sarah Marie who were shakin' it up front. Looking around, we all realized we kinda sorta crashed a party\u000afor Plush(Big and Beautiful Women). Wish nightclub had been transformed into Plush Nightclub, and I think they didn't mind a few Yelpers coming by to get our dance on, as everyone else around us were hella bumpin' and grindin' and totally backin' that thang up!\u000a\u000aWe hung out by the bar area later with Christina, Arvin, David, Stephanie, and Michael until we were ready to call it a long, fun filled evening with good times and great peeps...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(26/100) "Nerdy Dancing 2.5!?!?!?!"

VAfter missing my usual green tea cake fix at Goyemon for the longest time, I received a very helpful tip from Yuki (one of the Goyemon waiters) that Chef Misuzu had recently opened her Japanese style patisserie on Durango and Warm Springs(Next to Jiffy Lube) on the Southwest side of town.\u000a\u000aIf you've dined at Goyemon and/or Kabuto, you more than likely have had one(or a few in my case) of her signature items-Green Tea Cake, Tofu Cheesecake, Mille Crepes, etc. They can all be found here at Suzuya. Also having worked at notable places such as ALEX and the Pastry Shop at Aria, Chef Misuzu is no joke, and it shows in all of her creations. Very aesthetically pleasing to the eye, the Japanese palate leans more toward seasonal, natural, delicate flavors and textures, not overly too sweet, or too rich and decadent. Although the presentations may look a little American and European, the flavors are dominantly Japanese. Sorry, you won't find grossly huge portions, Ganache covered, ooey gooey overly decorated\u000asweets to cause a sugar coma, or artificial ingredients or colors to please the eye.\u000a\u000aI am also a huge fan of the Japanese style crepes served here as well.(Even better than that crepe joint in Japantown, SF) We shared my usual Green Tea Cake(The latest version is with a hazelnut cream and chocolate covered crispies) and a Strawberries and Whipped Cream Crepe with Green Tea Ice Cream as an add on(ice creams are also made in-house) at $4.50 for any of their 5 different creations-Strawberries and Whipped Cream, Banana and Chocolate, Blueberry and Cream Cheese, Nutella and Almond, and Apricot and Custard with add-ons for $.25-$.75 more, this is one of the best deals in town. The crepe was so soft, just slightly sweet,and a nice chewy texture, the addition of the fruit, cream and ice cream made every bite enjoyable!...So enjoyable, we had to get another crepe and I also noticed they just put a tray of Kabocha Squash Pies in the display case, so we had to get one of those as well!\u000a\u000aThe time and care put into preparing each crepe is also evident as insta-read laser thermometers are used to get a specific temperature before cooking each crepe\u000anot too hot that it wil brown or dry out the crepe, not too cold that the batter will stick. The end result is a very soft, pliable crepe, pale yellow with very little to no color and a nice delicate flavor and perfect vessel for the assorted fruits and toppings. This time we tried the Apricot and Custard. The slight tartness from the fresh apricots paired well with the vanilla-infused custard. The Kabocha Pie was a hit as well served with a crisp puff pastry crust, gently dusted with cinnamon and served with lightly sweetened wipped cream....Absolutely ONOLICIOUS!!!\u000a\u000aBefore you go:\u000aWed-Mon. 10-6pm, closed Tuesdays\u000aCall ahead to check for selections (they were out of the Mille Crepes dessert when we went)\u000aLooking forward to returning and trying all of the other creations at Suzuya...ALOHA!!!

VETHNIC BAKERY TOUR #4-JAPAN\u000a\u000aSuzuya has become one of our regular sweet shop stops and on this visit, we tried the Fuji Apple Pie, Mille Crepe, and a Blueberry and Cream Cheese Crepe. Best served warmed up and with a scoop of vanilla Ice cream (also made in house) the apple pie has alot of apple flavor without the sugar and spice overkill and that  nasty gel crap. The puff pastry crust is another plus, adding a nice crisp texture.\u000a\u000aThe Mille Crepe is a masterpiece in itself-crepe layers with strawberry whipped cream in between each layer finished with some apricot glaze and the Blueberry and Cream Cheese Crepe was just as tasty without it being overly sweet. The best time to come by is definitely within the first hour of opening, which ensures you a better variety. Suzuya's selections are made in smaller quantities and they tend to run out of items towards the afternoon, but the crepes are always available, so that's worth the visit alone!...ALOHA!!!

VSuzuya is now offering a couple of Savory Crepes which makes for a lunch time treat.\u000aWe decided to try the B.A.T. Crepe-Bourbon Bacon, Arugula, Avocado, and Sun Dried Tomato. The slight sweetness of the crepe worked well with the savory ingredients, and they were nice enough to even split it for us!\u000a\u000aThe Yuzu Panna Cotta had a flavor almost like a tart lemon yogurt  which was very refreshing without being overly sweet. The Fuji Apple Pie and Apricot-Almond Tart were great as usual (ask for it warmed up....even better!)\u000a\u000aThe new Rocky Road crepe is another sweet sensation- Kinako(Roasted Soybean Powder) marshmallows, toasted almonds, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce complete with a chocolate dipped Pocky Pretz stick...Delicious!\u000a\u000aA few more dining spaces and seating areas have been added to accomodate more guests and another installment in the "Steppin' Out" series has been added:\u000a\u000aUYE-"Steppin' Out": Sweet Stop at SUZUYA!!! Saturday, May 4th at 10 am...Hope to see you there!   ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE-(81/100) "Sweet and Savory"

VStopped in for a little afternoon snack and as usual, got our B.A.T Crepe and Fuji Apple Tart. Specials of the day were Millefeuille, and mini Petit Four Barquettes.\u000a\u000aThe Mille-Crepe has undergone a seasonal transformation to a Mango Mille-Crepe which was very delicious! Larger desserts for parties are also available-Rolled Green Tea Cake and Mango Tiramisu were available for $13.\u000a\u000aChef Misuzu also mentioned to me that she has started doing desserts for Shoku Ramen-Ya, where they serve the Tofu Cheesecake, Yuzu Panna Cotta, and the Fuji Apple Tart...Great news!\u000a\u000aGuess what? it is almost that time of year for her KILLER Kabocha Pie too! I can hardly wait!....:9     ALOHA!!!

VThis waZENt our original plan...We were jonZEN for some Avgolemono at Great Greek. It's a good thing they were closed, otherwise, we wouldn't have tasted the BEST J-Curry joint in town!\u000a\u000aWe were finally able to get a table, and immediately, we were warmly greeted by the ZEN staff. Wifey already had the Potato Croquette Curry in mind, and I almost always go for Chicken Katsu Curry, and waZENt planning on deviating from my first choice- but I had to turn my back and see on the blackboard of specials PORK TENDERLOIN...Sold!\u000a\u000aNow this iZENt the same as Tonkatsu folks, its the "filet mignon of buta" which is much more juicy and succulent, and definitely worth getting. Our entrees arrive in about 10-15 quick minutes by the chefs themselves which is a cool touch as far as service goes.\u000aI love that there are also about a doZEN different complimentary toppings and add-ons for your curry- 3 types of pepper, tonkatsu sauce, fukujinzuke, rokkyo(our two favorites we had to ask them to refill), almonds and raiZENs.\u000a\u000aEveryone who has dined there knows that the tables are hella close to each other and maximum capacity is less than two doZEN. We were a few seconds into enjoying the flavor exploZENs of what seemed like a thouZEN different seaZENings and spices\u000aof currylicious love when we hear our waiter say to the table next to us mention "We have a Curry Udon Special tonight"...Simultaneously, wifey and I look at each other, then look at him. Feeling the stab of our glares, he looks  towards us and apologetically replies "I forgot"...Immediately, I go into "Punk'd" mode, hand him my plate and say "Can you take this back?, I'd like the Udon Special please"....you should have seen the froZEN look on his face!...After a few seconds, I let him off the hook..."Nah, I'm just playing dude!" LOL!!!! \u000a\u000aOverall, we enjoyed our dinner and we'll definitely be back for the Curry Udon. If I could sum it up in two words??? Simply amaZEN!!!!  ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(6/100) "The Best J-Curry in Town"

VCruZEN down the street in my 6 4....Nah, Just playin'......(Watchu know 'bout NWA???)\u000a\u000aBut for reals, we were cruZEN Spring Mountain because a bunch of us were hella joneZEN for some ramen action at Koraku since it had just recently opened. We were all anxious and excited, but that night, it just waZENt gonna happen....They were closed. NOOOOOOO!!!!! We had to think of a plan B yet again.\u000a\u000aI was thinking..."This iZENt happening...again!?!? Where do we go??? Sora? Big Wong? Raku? Monta? Then it hit me.....how about ZEN???? Yeah! J-Curry sounded like a great  plan B!!!\u000a\u000aWe were all in agreement and met up there...Now its usually always packed inside with less then a few doZEN tables, but when we peeked inside, I thought I was loZEN my mind....Not a single person inside!?!?! Great for us! We were greeted by who I assume was Mr. ZENbayashi and immediately got seated towards the back. To make sure we didn't miss out on any items, I made sure to ask our waiter right off the bat if they had some Curry Udon off the menu, and he later confirmed that it waZENt available. \u000a\u000aI kept it simple this time and went with the Chicken Katsu Curry and  added cheese and corn. Combined with the complimentary toppings on the table, this made for another amaZEN meal with great friends. If you're looking for a spot to bring your parents, siblings or couZENs and they're in the mood for some currylicious action, look no further than ZEN.....The PERFECT reaZEN!!!   ALOHA!!!

VWe are always looking for different spots around town to try out, so we don't get caught up going to the same places over and over.....\u000a\u000aLooking for a different Breakfast/Brunch/Lunch spot? Add the 50's Diner to your rotation. Our waitress Veronika was awesome which totally added to our 5-star experience. A former Omelet House, this establishment has been in business for about 18 years, and is run by Veronika, her dad, and her husband crankin' out all the tasty menu selections.\u000a\u000aWe were in the mood for breakfast, and I noticed that they offer two types of pancakes-Buttermilk and Sweet Cream.  The difference, as Veronika put it-"Do you want deliciousness? or AWESOMENESS?(Sweet Cream). So we ordered up a plate of Awesomeness with two eggs and sausage.\u000a\u000aWe had to glance at the lunch selections and also ended up sharing The California-a grilled chicken breast sandwich with avocado and jalapeno bacon and decided to get it with Spuds, or The 50's Diner version of Potato Chips. Veronika was also nice to have the spuds cooked two ways-Soggy, her favorite, and Crispy, so we could try them both, and IMO, both ways were equally good! the sandwich was tasty, and the sweet cream pancakes are among my favorite in town(My other fave pancake being at Du-Pars. The Apple Pie A la mode was a great ending , and we will most definitely be back!\u000a\u000aGreat food, Great service, and as they say, "The Friendliest Diner Around"....They ain't lyin'......ALOHA!!!!

VThey are called Super Pizza, but We came here for some Cheesesteak action after reading about it on a recent talk thread.\u000a\u000aMarvel Superheroes decorate the restaurant here, and the workers are very personable. We ordered a cheesesteak to share. The question was-did we want it "Wit' Cheese?(Provolone) or "Wit' Whiz? (Cheese Whiz) I asked the lady if they could do half and half, and she said"no problem".....NICE! Unfortunately Amoroso Rolls are no longer used because they would buy them frozen, and as soon as they got to Vegas, the quality wasn't the same, so they use a local bakery. The Lady assured me it was pretty damn close to the real deal, so I said to do it up like the locals do, with onions, peppers, and the two different cheeses. We also decided to order a cherry pie for dessert.\u000a\u000aThe Cheesesteak arrives and let me tell you, it is enough for two people! They serve it with skinny fries like Freddy's and very filling. although both of them were good, I prefer the provolone over the whiz. The pie was also good and different, being made from pizza dough, it was crisp, and chewy, and the filling wasn't overly sweet.\u000a\u000aForget Pops, this is the place to get your cheesesteak fix. Returning to try their pizzas in the future as well.They ARE Super Pizza right? Their pizzas must be super!?!?\u000aALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(84/100) "Cheesesteak Search"

VBread and Butter fans can finally rejoice in the long awaited opening of Chef Chris Herrin's sister restaurant Meat and Three. A familiar concept  for those who are from the Southern U.S. region, for one set price, you choose one meat item and three sides which is a pretty good deal.\u000a\u000aThe atmosphere is just as inviting as Bread and Butter is, and the decor was jokingly summed up best by Chris himself: "Pintrest Bitch! LOL!!!" Yup, Wifey's a Pintrest fan as well...The Kitchen is open and you can see and smell the action as they pump out the orders. There are drapes that block out the light from the diners and they also offer outdoor patio dining as well.There is also a huge picnic table which is one of the focal points in the dining room for a big party or community style dining.\u000a\u000aFor $14.95 per person, it is ALOT of food and for those of you who have a sweet tooth, one of the 9 different pudding cups will count as one of your three sides.(I was told that the menu items posted now will run through December 1st, then they will make changes and additions accordingly.) We shared the Porchetta and Fried Chicken and our sides were Mashed Potatoes and Gravy, Bacon Dill Potato Salad, Farro Salad, Carrot Raisin Salad, Spaghetti Squash Al Pastor Style, and for Dessert, Carrot Cake and Strawberry Shortcake Pudding Cups. Oh, but the food didn't end there. We had White Bean Puree with Crostini and Spiced Peanuts for an Amuse Bouche and Pretzel Rolls with our dinner! Doggie bags for sure folks!\u000a\u000aThe Porchetta Had a nice fatty juiciness to it and the chicken was very similar to Ad Hoc/Addendum without the coarse salt and rosemary bits. The tasty sides come in some good sized crocks and one side is most definitely enough for two people to share. Ran into Yelper Shirley B. there and she had the Brisket which looked amazing. The Pudding cups were a nice ending to our meal. The Carrot Cake Pudding Cup came with Snickerdoodles and a piece of carrot cake hidden inside. The Strawberry shortcake had a vanilla sponge cake hidden inside. Future plans include meat and three dinners from around the world, but for now, come on in and enjoy some good 'ol Southern fare from Meat and Three. Congrats Chris!!!....ALOHA!!!

VSince I'm a huge fan of La Flor de Michoacan, we decided to check this new ice cream shop out after killing some time at Pet Kingdom.\u000a\u000aWe asked the gentleman behind the counter if this store was run by the same people running LFM and he said it was kind of a collaborative effort between LFM and La Bonita Market???  You would think The restaurant Lindo Michoacan was associated because it said "Lindo" instead of "La Flor"....\u000a\u000aAnywho, I could definitely see the similarities and set up inside. This shop looked more similar to the LFM location on the north side close to the Broadacres Event Center and Marketplace. Clean, tables and chairs to sit at, but lacking a few things....variety and taste.\u000a\u000aOnly four types of agua frescas and none of them being Alfalfa..:( Similar flavors, but missing my favorite, Pine Nut...:(  :(  It's like if I went to In-N-Out and couldn't order a Neapolitan shake because they only had vanilla? So I got a scoop of Mamey instead, and wifey got a Jamaica paleta which was way too tart and didn't have enough sugar to balance out the flavor, and my ice cream tasted  like it had melted and was frozen again. We descreetly fed the garbage can and drove to the flagship location on Charleston and Mojave where we know we could get what we were looking for. Sometimes its best to stick to your usual go-to  spots....ALOHA!

VThe first time we drove by El Taconento was on a Sunday evening and we were bummed to find out that they were closed. On our street taco scramble this past weekend, they were opened, and they had a small group of people waiting for their orders which was also a good sign.\u000a\u000aRun by a husband and wife team (I think) they have a nice selection-Tacos,Tortas, Quesadillas, Burritos and something no other vendor offers, Huaraches(Slippers).\u000aThey also offer six types of meat selections-Asada, Lengua, Cabeza, Pollo, Al Pastor(He has an Al Pastor Carousel inside) and Birria, another thing no other vendor offers.\u000aTraditionally made with goat, Tacontento's version is beef, kinda sorta like picadillo(if you had Cafe Rio's Chile Roasted Beef, it is very similar to that)\u000a\u000aSo we shared a Taco de Al Pastor, Taco de Lengua,($1.50/each) and a Huarache de Birria($5) The al pastor had very good flavor with nicely charred bits, and the lengua was oh-so-soft and tenderlicious! There's nothing like a fresh handmade tortilla, and this is the only way tacos are made here .\u000a\u000aThe Huarache is a 1/4-inch thick by 10-inch oval of masa that is griddled to perfection\u000atopped with beans, meat of your choice,shredded lettuce, crema Mexicana, and Cotija cheese.Just as good as the ones I've had in the streets of Cancun, and much tastier than the huaraches served at Los Antojos. Wait times vary, depending on how busy they are, but if you are patient, the food served up here is definitely worth the wait. easily becoming one of my favorite street vendors...ALOHA!!!

VA bunch of yelpers came out(just 11 hours after killing udon, ramen and sushi for 3 hours!) for Jen S.' UYE , and about half of us have never dined here yet, so we eagerly waited in anticipation after hearing the rave reviews.\u000a\u000aAs you step inside, the atmosphere immediately sucks you in, so homey, a little bit of pintrest, and so inviting, great combo of color, wood, and stone in perfect harmony,\u000aHoney Salt could easily make you feel like you were in Napa Valley wine country.\u000aMismatched chairs, random mirrors, chandeliers, and lamps placed along the banquettes(so comfy, makes you wanna grab one of the pillows and take a nappy-nap\u000aafter a fantabulous meal!) Check out the decor in the restrooms too-Sportscards and restaurant menus in the men's room, Hotel key cards in the women's room...total coolness. Love the Service staff attire too....Flannel looking collared  shirts, jeans, and Chuck Taylors? SWEET! Even Chef Kim Canteenwalla was rockin' jeans and chucks with his chef whites...Now that's what's up!\u000a\u000aLavash and Potato Rolls with white bean puree arrive as we place our orders, and wifey decides on the Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich -Two crisp juicy chicken breasts with slaw and  honey mustard on a soft brioche bun served with Honey Salt's version of a chopped salad full of romaine, kale, carrots, white cheddar, radish, edamame, and avocado...a very good compliment to the very tasty sandwich that has been nicknamed "Chik-Fil-A on crack" (I never had CFA, so I wouldn't really know)\u000a\u000a I go with the Backyard Favorite Burger. A huge burger(ground from tri-tip, chuck, and shortrib) that protrudes outside the pilowy soft brioche bun topped with sweet tomato jam, butter lettuce, tomato, red onion, and beehive cheddar...only slight knock was that the fries weren't hot like they should be... Now this burger has got to be one of THE BEST in town, not only hands down, but hands, face and knees down, like bow down status! Simplicity at its finest and executed flawlessly. Order this bad boy medium rare and get that fried egg on top and you won't be disappointed!\u000a\u000aQuality ingredients alone will draw me back here and  its not about quantity(quadruple bypass @ Heart Attack Grill anyone?) and the price point is not absolutely ridonkulous like on the strip ($50 for Carne Asada? What is it? Kobe Beef stuffed with Foie and Truffles???)\u000a\u000aGot to meet Vanessa N. who dined with us and Terri R. who was dining nearby, and I also ran into Luis (formerly from Slidin' Thru) and he raved about the Dinner menu, so a return trip is planned for sure. If you haven't dined here yet, what are you waiting for? GETCHOA$$OVAHEA!!!!!......ALOHA!!!

VNot your usual flavors here, and not many shops sell these flavors at all. The only other place I've seen these flavors are at Boba City Cafe. You may also score some flavors at Kung Fu and Wendy's Noodle Cafe. Peter Wong is the man who provides the goods for these restaurants\u000a\u000aWe tried all the Asian flavors Mr. Wong had:\u000a\u000aDURIAN-an acquired taste, either you like it, or not-its okay, nothing I'd enjoy scoops of though\u000a\u000aGINGER-nice punch from the ginger root and the addition of crystalized ginger chunks\u000a\u000aAZUKI BEAN-nice sweetness to it, kinda like a hint of bubble gum too.\u000a\u000aBLACK SESAME-very nutty, almost like tahini paste in ice cream form\u000a\u000aGREEN TEA-very strong bitter taste, one of the stronger green tea ice creams I've tasted\u000a\u000aLYCHEE-floral, tropical, naturally sweet(he doesn't use the ones in syrup)\u000a\u000aTARO-my favorite, just a hint of sweetness with nice bits of taro, not artificially purple either.\u000a\u000a\u000aWifey got  a scoop of the lychee, and I got a scoop of green tea, taro, and and banana chocolate chip. loved the natural banana flavor, and it didn't need any chocolate IMO..\u000a\u000aCurious to try the Mango and Pink Guava when we return...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(1/100) "The Wong Way to do Ice Cream"

VThanks to Yelp, we were fortunate enough to score tickets for this years Foodie Fest.\u000aThe Red Dragon folks handed us VIP bracelets and lanyards, so that was SUH-WEET!!!\u000a\u000aAYCD, nice lounging area, and tasty eats from:\u000a\u000aVic Vegas-Beef Short Rib with Sweet Potato Puree\u000a\u000aRedneck Kitchen-Meatloaf Spring Rolls and Deep Fried PB&J Sammies\u000a(The reason why some of you couldn't find RK...they were servin' up the VIP tent...;)\u000a\u000aFluff Ice-Soju, Almond, and Strawberry Fluff\u000a\u000aWe also got to try Da Big Baos and Da Lobsta Balls, from Las Vegas' newest truck WA DA PHO, Truffle, sour cream and onion/Salt and Vinegar Tornado Potatoes from you guessed it...TORNADO POTATO...Deconstructed Halo Halo, Peach Dream , and Pretty in Blue from FLUFF ICE, Root Beer Float from CJ's CUSTARD. One of the coolest deals was purchasing the collector's cup from PIONEER POP...$8 for the cup and $1 refills FOR LIFE!\u000a\u000aKicked it in the Yelp Tent(which was un-supervised) with Anthony M., Wifey, and Jin C.\u000awhere kiddies were havin' a blast, people fell over while on the Yelp Sofas all embarrassed, and we witnessed an intense game of Jenga, only to be toppled over "accidentally" by a Kate Bosworth look-alike...\u000a\u000aSOOOOOO many people bitch and moan about food truck festivals, such as:\u000a\u000a*WHY DO WE HAVE TO PAY A FEE TO GET IN?\u000a\u000aBe thankful Red Dragon took time out to organize what is Las Vegas' best Food Truck festival...proceeds from admission also go to Three Square Food Bank too...better than STReatS, and places like Costco MLK and South Point don't have theirs anymore....would you rather not have one at all???That's what I thought....Props to RED DRAGON!!!\u000a\u000a*4-5 HOURS FOR WHITE CASTLE?\u000a\u000aOn Friday, WC stopped taking orders at 8pm....stopped by AT 12:15PM to see a whole bunch of people STILL waiting to pick up their orders!? One lady even left with her friend IN TEARS because they could no longer wait for their order and was already late to wherever they needed to be. This lady even got in my face and said "Its so worth the wait for a fresh White Castle!" Ummm OH-KAY lady, calm your hormones....those patties are frozen to begin with, and they had only TWO grills, and only able to cook 200 sliders at a time- that would be 4 peoples orders if the bought crave cases(50 sliders) or two peoples orders for Crave Crates(100 Sliders) Dude, get 'em at WinCo or Costco...its the SOS IMO.....\u000a\u000a\u000a*THE LINES ARE TOO LONG!\u000a\u000aUmmm....Come EARLY????

VAviation Nation is a great way to spend Veteran's Day at an "open house" and annual Las Vegas Air Show for the public at Nellis Air Force Base.\u000a\u000aVeterans, kids, and everyone else in between got a great chance to tour various air crafts and enjoy entertainment by the U.S Armed Forces. From paratroopers during The Star Spangled Banner, air strike demonstrations, and precision aerial acrobatics from various planes and jets was an awesome spectacle for all.\u000a\u000aMy favorites were the Heritage Flight showcasing the history of the American aircraft, the F-22 Raptor demonstration, and of course, The Thunderbirds finale.\u000a\u000aThis is one annual event that is not to be missed...Happy Veteran's Day!...ALOHA!!!

VI've never had to visit a chiropractor in my life(knock on wood), nor have I ever had an adjustment before, but I've seen wifey go through a couple of sessions. Thanks to fellow yelper Julie K., We were in the area and I remembered Julie's talk thread post\u000aso we decided to drop by for a visit.\u000a\u000aLove the modern vibe the moment you step inside. It doesn't have that doctor's office feel to it . Julie had us fill out some info and I met Dr.Lovaas and he took me behind to "where all the magic happens." Dr. Lovaas also took the time out to explain what The Joint was all about, the benefits of being adjusted, and what to expect during my session. After a "flexibility survey"- Look up, down, side-to-side, bend over reach for your toes, bend as far back as I can, etc. I first lay face down and Dr. Lovass goes to work, first getting an overall feel of my entire spine, concluding that he noticed tension in my lower spinal and neck region, which is due to the fact of  constant heavy lifting at work.\u000a\u000aDr. Lovaas gives you a "heads up" on what's gonna happen... as he is easing the tension off my spine....first, my lower back area,"you're gonna feel a pop here" sounding like a hundred knucles cracking simultaneously...CRRRACK!, Then, face up, crossing my arms giving myself a hug, turned my shoulders one way, my neck the opposite way,"I'm gonna give slight pressure here" and CRRRRACK!\u000aFinally adjusting both sides and three different adjustments during my time there, I felt great, thanked Dr. Lovaas and Julie for a great session and looking forward to returning  for sure!  ALOHA!!!

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(98/365) "Hipster Hangout"\u000a\u000aCame to Commonwealth with a bunch of friends after checking out The Container Park. Cool vibe inside, but the spot you wanna be is up on the rooftop. Great DJ, awesome song selections, and we even had a great spot to chill right up by the speakers for a good amount of time until the douchey security kicked us off our spot to accommodate some touristy hipsters who didn't even use the spot!\u000a\u000aDrinks were good, but a bit pricey(its Vegas, Its touristy, and people will pay) Commonwealth makes a pretty tasty Moscow Mule and beer selections are pretty good too. Come early to avoid the cover charge, long lines, and the risk of being cut off to rooftop access.   ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  4

VETHNIC BAKERY TOUR #3-ARMENIA\u000a\u000aWe were still stuffed from our brunch at Manon, but we still popped in to have a looksee...I was surprised to see French, Italian, and Greek items here as well. The lady behind the counter was very nice and helped answer any questions we had.\u000a\u000aWe decided to try an item called Gata- baked Katafi(shredded filo dough) with a milk/cream cheese flavored filling which came with a rosewater syrup on the side. This had an interesting taste and texture, but probably not something I'd order again. I prefer crispy filo sheets rather than sredded filo which kinda tastes like biting into underbaked shredded wheat cereal.\u000a\u000aVisit # 2 ...\u000a\u000aReturned to Manan and they did some re-arranging...The Filo pastries are now nicely displayed off to the side and it looks like they added a few more selections...We also wanted to try a Lahmajoon, or what the lady refered to as Armenian Pizza, or Armenian Meat Pies. I would desribe it as similar to a crispy baked tortilla/flatbread topped with ground meat, onions, and spices. Not too sure of it was beef or lamb but it was pretty good. At a dollar each, its also a steal. We also tried a cinnamon-walnut flavored baklava which wasn't bad either.Looking forward to returning to try other treats in the future. I just like the fact that I can experience other cultures through their food without having to leave Vegas...ALOHA!!!

VWe stopped in for dinner at Kauai Caf, the newest spot to serve up local island grindz.\u000aPerusing the menu, they got your usual local standbys, but they also got a Specials board right outside before you enter that's worth checking out.\u000a\u000aPeople also rave about this Heineken Beer Batter Fried Chicken, but a piece of paper popped out of the menu that sealed the deal for me. The Lau Lau Feast (Served Fridays and Saturdays) is a taste of Hawaii that is totally worth getting- Lau Lau, Kalua Pig, Rice, Mac Salad, Lomi Salmon, Ahi Poke, Squid Luau, Chicken Long Rice, Haupia, and of course, POI....Most definitely a feast for a king, or a "Hungry Hawaiian" in this case...;)\u000a\u000aI killed it, but I just wish they gave more poi than a half full cup. Wifey ordered up a Surfrider Platter which she seemed to enjoy as well. Kauai Caf probably ranks right up there with Island Style, Island Flavor, and 808 Mixed Plate. If you're in the area and your opu is itchin' for some onolicious kau kau, Kauai Caf is the spot!......ALOHA!!!

VA few of us met David S. here for a quick snacky-snack. Love the vibe they have goin' on....waitstaff in Brittish Punk looking attire complete with Doc Martens, newspaper print dresses sported by the hostesses, beer kegs on the wall, sweet lighting and woodwork throughout the restaurant, very cozy and inviting.\u000a\u000aOur server Elise was awesome during our visit offering her expertise in food and drink selections, but the only bummer was that they were out of Duck Confit that day, so we couldn't feast on the very popular Duck Poutine..:( No worries though, we all shared the following off the Pub menu:\u000a\u000aDEVILISHLY DEVILED EGGS\u000aSelf explanatory, good, but anyone can make this at home\u000a\u000aSHEPHARD'S PIE\u000aA hearty mix of beef, lamb and veggies combined with butterylicious mashed potatoes...One of Ramsay's popular signature dishes,very good and comforting\u000a\u000aCLAMS AND MUSSELS IN SAFFRON BROTH\u000aCooked expertly, very delicious, and use the crostini to sop up all that saffron love!\u000a\u000aSHORTRIB AND BEEF CHEEK SANDWICH\u000aThis sandwich is in its own category, possibly one of the tastiest sandwiches you'll ever sink your teeth into...Perfectly braised shortrib, deep-fried beef cheek with arugula, aioli, and sweet onion jam served with gargantuan steak fries as big as my hand? Definitely the star of the night! the Innis & Guinn went perfectly with all of these selections too.\u000a\u000aDefinitely returning for the duck poutine, that is if my opu doesn't pull a jedi mind trick into getting another sandwich!.....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(12/100) "Gordon's Gastropub"

VChecked this place out since we were in the area. Tacos are $1.50 each and we tried the cabeza and al pastor to see how it stacks up with the competition ...\u000a\u000aThe meats were pretty good, but pretty skimpy. The tortillas were slightly dry and on their way to hard.\u000a\u000aWould I be back? Not likely, knowing that Taqueria El Pastorcito still owns the streets, followed by Taqueria El Buen Pastor(formerly Tacos El Pastorcito) ....IMO....ALOHA!!!

VNovecento refers to the 900 degree oven temperature the Napoletana Style pizzas are cooked at. We attended the soft opening and at the time, a limited menu was being served-Pizzas, Caesar Salad(The REAL deal), and Gelato.\u000a\u000aThe atmosphere is very cozy and inviting, and you also get to see all the action from the dining room. Chef Marc and his team were in action, and his simple, straightforward approach is an easy four step process:\u000a\u000a1) Choose your Base-$7.00\u000a"Margherita"-Crushed San Marzano Tomatoes. Olive Oil, Basil, and Mozzarella\u000a"Bianco"-Olive Oil, Garlic, Basil, and Mozzarella\u000a\u000a2) Choose your Topping-$1.00 each (*no more than 3 are suggested to fully enjoy    the  flavors and authenticity of your pizza) assorted meats, cheeses, egg,and veggies are available, and also Roasted Chicken($2), Smoked Salmon, and Prosciutto di Parma($3)\u000a\u000a3) Order a Soup,Salad, and/or dessert-Salads($4/$7) are subject to seasonal availability, Pasta Fajiole($4.50) and Gelato($3.00)\u000a\u000a4) Pay for your order, grab a seat and your order will be brought out to you...MANGIA!\u000a\u000a\u000aWifey went with a Margherita base, Pepperoni, Mushrooms, and Spinach. That was AWESOME! I knew I wanted a White Pizza, but I went the "Omakase" route and left it in Chef Marc's hands.To the Bianco Base, he added Chili Flakes, Pancetta, Romano, and an egg... simple, and FANTABULOUS!!! Love the crispy, chewy crust and just the right amount of toppings. I'm calling this one "Nelson's Pizza", cause that's the way I'll have my pizza every time I visit Novecento. For dessert, we shared a Gingersnap and Banana-Pecan Gelato which was a great ending to our dinner.\u000a\u000aSo happy that we got a sneak preview of things to come, and even much more happier Novecento is in my neck of the woods. Congrats Chef Marc, and Welcome to the Neighborhood!   \u000a\u000aComing Soon will be signature pizzas,salads, and even a house speciality Eggplant Parmesan. Dessert choices will also include Pizzelle, Cannoli, and Affogatto. ALOHA!!!

VOpened for barely a week,(3 days to be exact) Pinkbox has created a buzz around town and people are celebrating with what may be Vegas' first local gourmet doughnut shop that can definitely compete with the chains(Dunkin, Krispy Kreme) and other local doughnut shops. The staff up front and even Chef Rodney in the back are a friendly, upbeat bunch, and massive props for that alone, while trying to work out the timing, scheduling, supply, and demand on minimal hours of rest. Boy, do I know how that goes when you're burning that midnight oil!\u000a\u000aSelections at Pinkbox Range from $1.00-$1.75 are divided into 3 categories:\u000a\u000aCLASSIC: $1.00\u000aGlazed, Chocolate Glazed, Vanilla Sugar, Glazed, Traditional, or Chocolate Cake, Rainbow Sprinkles, Cinnamon Spice, Blueberry, and Buttermilk Bar\u000a\u000aSPECIALITY: $1.25\u000aAll filled Doughnuts (Chocolate, Raspberry Jam, Whipped Creme, Bavarian Creme)\u000a\u000aGOURMET: $1.75\u000aCampfire S'mores, Lemon Meringue, White Chocolate Peppermint, Fat Elvis, Sweet Potato, American Apple Pie Fritter, and Date with a Nutty Pig.\u000aPrices aren't bad, and I'd rather grab a gourmet doughnut than a gourmet cupcake which goes for about a dollar more.\u000a\u000aWe got a little bit of everything, but I really wanted a Fat Elvis (PB filled, chocolate glazed, topped with a caramelized banana) and I didn't see it in the case, so I asked, and just my luck, Chef Rodney was finishing up some in the back. While we waited, one of the guys behind the counter(believe his name was Lance) gave us a Sweet Potato doughnut which was his favorite, and I can see why. Its a cake doughnut bursting with sweet potato flavor and just enough glaze without making it overly toothachingly sweet.\u000a\u000aSome things are just meant to be together, like peanut butter and jelly, milk and cookies, peas and carrots, and of course, coffee and doughnuts. The coffee served her is pretty bangin'...Its from Coffee Reserve out of Arizona and the beans are from El Salvador called Finca El Majahual. Very aromatic, alot of cajones, and the taste goes perfectly with the doughnuts that you don't even need to add cream or sugar. Future plans include expanding their selections with even more savory selections and possibly other franchises. On our way out, the gentlemen with the tie (believe his name was Roberto) mentioned that they were finishing up a few Date with a Nutty Pig ones. Looked at the clock, paused about oh....1 second and said "we have time"....Its like a glazed doughnut did the nasty with a bacon wrapped date, and BOO-YAH!!! So worth the wait!\u000a\u000aWelcome to the neighborhood Pinkbox!!!  ALOHA!!!

VAfter a Sunday Yoga sesh with the Yoga Master David V., we met Alison Hakan, owner of She Bakes, a small operation bakery which specializes in gluten free and vegan sweets and snacks.\u000a\u000aShe was nice enough to have cookies for us to try, and WOW! I've never tried a gluten-free peanut butter cookie that was this good! With a pastry background from Le Cordon Bleu, and a passion for using the best natural ingredients available, Alison's products are not your typical healthy made, not-so-good tasting cookies. The bag of Gluten-Free Peanut Butter Cookies was gone in seconds!\u000a\u000aBummer that there is no storefront(yet) but you can find She Bakes items at Sambalatte in Summerlin. For those of you who are trying to live a healthier lifestyle, or are seeking very tasty gluten-free/vegan baked goods and sweets, give She Bakes a try. You won't be disappointed!   ALOHA!!!

VWe joined up with other yelpers for brunch, and we were excited to check out Chef Sosa's take on some Asian Fusion action.\u000a\u000a5 stars alone for the company...Always a good time with the gang!\u000a5 stars for the awesome service by Camile...YOU ROCK!\u000aBUT...in my case, the portions, price point and the execution of food just fell short of me being a fan. The Poppy basket advertised an assortment...we got 4 small, overbaked, non-flaky croissants with butter, honey, and jam..for $12? um, no...\u000a\u000aI love mochi anything, so I ordered the Mochi Pancakes on the "Big Plates" section, and Wifey ordered the Fish Sandwich with Fries and Kim Cheese Sauce so we could share both plates. When the pancakes arrived, it was a Sh-Stack... way less than a short stack! More like 2 small tortillas with a sprinkle of berries and a little dollop of creme fraiche! Although the flavor was good, $11 is definitely not worth it, and I should have gone with a sandwich or burger which was about the same price.(The photo is a zoomed in shot) Either remove these from the big plates menu, or add at least 3 more pancakes to make up for the missing O, R, and T in short stack!?!?\u000a\u000aThe ice creams we all shared(Miso-Toffee, Lemon Poppy Seed, and Strawberry-Sake, all topped with Kettle Chips) were pretty good, but not too sure if I'd return after a not-so good first impression....still on the fence for Poppy Den...more like 3.5 stars....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(27/100) "Don't Get High on the Poppy Seed Supply!"

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(144/365) "Seeing Red..I Mean Scarlet"\u000a\u000aChecked out this little spot next to N9ne at the Palms a while back. Little is right! I think 6-8 people in here is the maximum capacity. Any more than that would be a tad too many.\u000a\u000aNow when it comes to mixed drinks/craft cocktails, you're speaking a foreign language to me(I lean more towards beer and wine) Don't remember what we got, but it was some kind of  shot infusion with pop rocks which was kinda fun and interesting. After chatting with the bartender for some time, he realized that we were locals and was kind enough to get a pass for us to check out both Ghostbar and Moon.\u000a\u000aThere are a lot of other options around town, but if you want a little privacy away from the norm with your date or significant other, This little cozy spot might do it for you. ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  3

VI guess third time's the charm, right?\u000a\u000aTried going to the salon......They were off doing a special function...never got to go back\u000a\u000aSaw them at the Foodie Fest....They had to close up shop for no hot running water...Darn!\u000a\u000aTwo strikes and counting, but wait......Great Bao has transformed into Fat Choy, and are inside the Eureka Casino....EUREKA CASINO!?!?!?!? Well at least they now have a brick and mortar location, and I know where to find them.\u000a\u000a After reading all these reviews 3 words seemed evident....FAT CHOY BURGER. So we ordered that medium rare, AKA the ONLY way to enjoy a burger, and oh, lookie here..what's this??? a special, that week only 3 bao and a drink special for $10? SOLD! Choices were Roasted Chicken, Tofu, Pork Belly, Peking Duck, and Soft Shell Crab. Not really in a tofu mood, and having pork belly'd well over 50 times, I'm a sucker for soft shell crab, juicy roasted chicken and perfect peking duck, so we went with those.\u000a\u000aIt was also my first encounter with the dangerously cool freestyle coke machine. With endless combinations imaginable I came up with a Vanilla Root Beer, and Wifey got a Peach Mello Yello(ask Jenny to make you a Gummy Bear!)\u000a\u000aThe Fat Choy Burger did not disappoint and is in my top burgers category. The 3 Bao Special was also great with the crispy skin from the roasted chicken and peking duck, but my favorite bao is the soft shell crab and I would take that over the pork belly any day. Thank you Sheridan and Jenny, your patience and persistence has definitely paid off and I wish you both nothing but continued success!    ALOHA!!!

VI love checking out all kinds of animals and cool creatures, especially when you can get up close and pet them. For a $5 donation, we got to meet a few residents of the upcoming opening of the Wild Adventures Zoo, an exotic animal petting zoo that will be located on the Southwest side of town.\u000a\u000aThere were a few snakes we got to handle, a Leopard Gecko, even cooler than the Geico one, a Blue Tongued Skink, we even got to carefully pet a Hedgehog that was cooler than Sonic, Wifey even let the little Agouti suck her thumb like a baby!\u000aThe Kinkajou and the Coatimundi were other cool animals we saw, and Guido the Tortoise was visiting with everyone and even performed feats of strength by moving a steel chair a good distance...yeah, his shell was too big to go under the chair...LOL!\u000a\u000aThis Zoo will be a great attraction for the kids and family, and I can't wait to come back when they open.    ALOHA!!!

VI'm with Mike and Debra on this one....it started out good, and ended up A-OK....\u000a\u000aYes, they have a wide variety of things, yes, its clean and spacious, and their condiment bar is pretty cool, etc. but when we arrived here on a Friday night, I was expecting tables to be packed since there are many highly rated reviews. We had an empty dining room with only one other table.\u000a\u000aWe entered through the back and the ladies were pretty nice and helpful, and we ordered an Elote(Corn on the cob) from her. The order system is similar to Gordo's\u000aso its not difficult navigating your way down the line. While the ladies were nice, no service with a smile from the guys, and we kept repeating our order at lest 3-4 times because the music was too loud and they had a hard time remembering what we ordered. We ordered some Nopales(Cactus) and three tacos-Al Pastor, Tripa, and Cabeza.\u000a\u000aWe liked the corn and the cactus was pretty good with the beans, but the tacos were okay. The Cabeza was pretty bland, I always request Tripa extra crispy, but this was still chewy on the inside. The best of the three was the Al Pastor. Good flavor, but pretty skimpy on the meat. Glad I tried this place though. Its okay, But you have a much better option just up a few blocks from here....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(96/100) "New Taco Joint in Town"

VWhile favorites like the Shimi Bun, Kaki-Age, and Gyu Sliders(*available in nigiri form) are no longer on the HH menu anymore :(, there are new items that have become new favories for me. Service has ALWAYS been top notch here, and Chef Ramil and his team always have new, exciting creations for us to indulge in!\u000a\u000aWe tried the Coconut Ceviche, which seems to be a spin on Peruvian Ceviche with tuna, strawberries, tomatoes, red onions, and plantain chips with a coconut-lime sauce...SO GOOD! The Salmon Yaki is another great menu addition featuring perfectly cooked crispy skin on salmon with a perfect medium rare interior, orange segments,  roasted fennel, parsnip puree and chips with an addicting balsamic broth.\u000a\u000aMy new favorite cold plate is the Uni Hotate. Uni lovers, this one is not to be missed!\u000aUni presented three ways-AAA Grade Uni as is, puree, and panna cotta combined with fresh scallops, avocado, yellow cherry tomatoes, yuzu sauce and micro greens. Guaranteed "Exorcist Effect" in every bite!\u000a\u000aMy favorite hot item here has become the Tsutsumi, Chef Ramil's Sisig which is topped with an egg and served with lettuce. I prefer to enjoy this with rice though.\u000aI also noticed a new line up of desserts which is a good excuse to return! I really REALLY hope the Uni Hotate and the Tsutsumi become signature menu items like the Brussels Sprouts(hint, hint!!!,,,,;)   ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  5 \u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(40/365) "Sea Urchin and Sisig"

So happy Thrifty's opened up again after all the Rite-Aids closed down in Vegas....\u000a\u000a36 different flavors to choose from, you can sample any one before you make your final choice, and both times we've been here, service with a smile,and in our area which makes it sweeter!(and dangerous too!) They got the favorites like Chocolate Malt Crunch, and Black Cherry, as well as kid(and big kid) favorites Circus Animal Cookies, Blue Bubble Gum , and the brightly fluorescent colored Cotton Candy.\u000a\u000aAlways a great place to bring the family any time of the year because ANY time is a good time for ice cream, don't you agree???

VAlthough this was a PET expo, about 90% were dogs. We did see a talking bird, snake, and ferrets though, and the only cats were the ones up for adoption. Perfect  place to take the birthday boy after he'd been pimped out. Dolce got to mix and mingle\u000awith all kinds of bitches!\u000a\u000aVendors offered things like grooming, boarding, immunization shots, and even intimate portraits. Fans of the show "Pit Boss" even got to meet the Pit Boss himself and there were also obidnence training tips offered on the side stage and exhibitons throughout the day. After watching some dogs go through the training course with their  master, we got to try our luck with Dolce. We paid a $2 donation and we guided him through each task. Once I got his attention with a treat, he went through the jumps and the tunnels pretty easily. The see saw was the most difficult task, but he met me at the end with his hard earned treat after jumping through the last hoop.\u000a\u000aWe coudn't get more than a hundred feet at a time without being stopped by women, children, and men asking to pet or have a photo with the birthday boy! A handful of people and even other Pomeranian owners claimed Dolce to be the cutest dog in the entire expo so that was something to definitely be proud of....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(30/100) "Wassup Dog!?!?!?!?"

I don't know why it took us this long to come out and enjoy this food fair!\u000a\u000aWhen you first arrive, you swap your cash for tokens-I don't get this...supposedly they cannot take money in exchange for the food!?!? I saw people paying with cash and the vendors said they take cash!?!? No biggie though, we had both, and we came ready and hungry to feast on Thai/Laotian Specialities.\u000a\u000aFood Stations are set up on the left side, and the dining area is on the right. Proceeds from the monthly food fair go towards expenses in the Monastery so it is a win-win situation. You have a whole bunch of tasty goodies to choose from:\u000a\u000aSatay, Papaya Salad, Pad Thai, Burmese Pickled Tea Leaf Salad, Various Asian herbs, spices, and produce, Fishcakes, and other seafood specialities, assorted sweets and cookies, and a very flavorful noodle soup, and Thai tea, coffee and a colorful coconut drink as well.\u000a\u000aWe had the noodle soups, some Thai Iced Tea, and Roti with Condensed Milk which I wasn't a big fan of(too doughy, not crispy enough) We also got Some Burmese Pickled Tea Leaf Salad, Pad Thai, and Sweet Sticky Rice with Mango, Coconut Cream, and Toasted Mung Bean for Dinner and dessert....:9\u000a\u000aDefinitely looking forward to the next Thai food fair.....ALOHA!!!!

VWe returned yet again for some onolicious Thai food, and this time we arrived at the start (9am) which is, in my opinion the only time to come if you want to have the best picks of all of their selection.\u000a\u000aChanging our money into tokens, the lady points to these pastries in a bag that look like Empanadas and says " You want to get a bag of these?, they sell out quickly"\u000a"What's inside?" I asked...."Curry Chicken pastries" she says...A man is also unloading more bags on to her table with a huge grin. Hmmm? are we being suckered into buying a bag?(7 pieces, $5) The lady then sets two bags aside for herself, and going with my instincts, I get a bag. I love chicken curry, but what it is, is a curry spiced pumpkin and chicken Thai style empanada, and these are GOOD! half an hour later, like she said, they were all gone.\u000a\u000aAlso not there was the Sticky Rice and Mango, and Burmese Pickled Tea Leaf Salad, but we got to try the Chicken and Rice with Ginger Infused Jasmine Rice and the lady serving that told us "You'll be back" and you know what? We got another one to enjoy for dinner.(along with some bomb Pad Thai) Its THAT good! The Noodle soup(skinny noodles) was even more flavorful this time too. About 8 of these vendors made the trek all the way from LA on their own dime, so thanks to them, we have the luxury of enjoying all of their food on a monthly basis. Beats going to the more well known spots in town IMHO.\u000a\u000aYou won't want to miss out on the next one on September 22...See you there!  ALOHA!!!

VThanks again to Mary Rose F., a bunch of Yelpers got to see Pin Up. Focusing on the Calendar Girl of the Pin up era.\u000a\u000a5 dancers, a 6-person live band, one singer, and the hostess Claire Sinclair put on a pretty good production mixing in a little bit of big band, pole dancing, burlesque,etc. The show was done tastefully without being sleazy. Being co-produced by none other than Frankie Moreno, the band and their music selections added life to the show.\u000a\u000aThe dancers and their acts were pretty good as well. Choreographed by Lacey Schwimmer(Dancing with the Stars/So You Thnk You Can Dance?) The dancers displayed lots of athleticism in each number. Miss Sinclair would make an appearance every once in awhile and act as a narrator too, but in the Asian number, she revealed the twins(with pasties, of course) which I thought(as well as everyone else) was part of the show!?!?\u000a\u000aApparently not, as it was featured in an article in The Las Vegas Sun a few days later that she went off script and did her own thing! Maybe because Yelp was in the house?(She even gave us a shout out!) Not too sure if that was a one time thing or that its part of the show now. Overall, a good show, and we even got to do a meet and greet with the cast afterwards.....ALOHA!!!

VAfter Zip lining through the jungles and swimming in the Cenote Sagrada (Sacred Well)\u000awe feasted on a local spread which featured Salbutes, Panuchos, Pollo Asada, and Cochinita Pibil. One of our greatest food memories on our visit to Cancun.\u000a\u000aEnter Carlos Cervera, a native of the Yucatan and 30-year resident of Las Vegas, and a restaurateur who's taking a gamble, not only opening up a restaurant, but in a location where he calls the "Scary Mall" because of the few businesses that are here,(same mall as Del Taco and Four Kegs off of US 95 North and Jones) Huge space, out of the way location where people don't really frequent, alot is riding on his shoulders...\u000a\u000aBut I love the optimism and passion of this man, and also in the food he serves here. He along with family members Miguel and their cook who is also family have brought the flavors and soul food of the Yucatan to diners who want to experience the real deal. Yes, he has had to compromise a little to people who come in looking for Tacos, Burritos, and Quesadillas, which is why he has those items on the menu as well.\u000a\u000aWe started off with some chips and two great tasting salsas, and a vegetable soup filled with potatoes, carrots, and chayote. After a pretty lengthy conversation with Carlos and Miguel about our visits to Cancun, the places, culture, and people, and his early "rocker" days(His fave artist is Jimi Hendrix) out of nowhere comes two tamales-One done in the Yucatan style steamed in Banana Leaf and One in the usual corn husk topped with a really complex Mole-both filled with chicken, but each having their own distinct flavor.\u000a\u000aCarlos also put together an assortment of Panuchos for us-Fresh tortillas smeared with refried black beans, meat(we had chicken, turkey, and cochinita pibil) topped with lettuce, tomato, and avocado-one bite of this instantly brought me back to that Zip lining moment through the jungle, and if food can make me do that, you can bet that I'm a fan! We finished off with some Arroz con Leche topped with bananas, raisins and cinnamon, which had a great flavor but the rice was just a hair under(not as bad as the Embers risotto though...;0) We don't really know the full total because he didn't charge us for our full order(sneaky guy) but we one-upped Carlos, added the menu prices up and left a hefty tip on top of it. He asked us to sign his "Good Luck" book and we thanked him and his family.\u000a\u000aIt is businesses like this I love to continue and support, I am in the process of working out the deets with Carlos so we can all gather up once again for a taste of the Yucatan...Stay tuned!....ALOHA!!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(47/100) "Soul Food of the Yucatan...:9"

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(175/365) "Broasted, Not Fried"\u000a\u000aAfter spending the  day  in Boulder City, we made a much needed stop at Chilly Jilly's.\u000aMy Dole Whip Float hit the spot because it was scorching outside! We also decided to share a Chicago Dog and since we've heard a lot of raves for their Broaster Chicken, we got a two piece basket to share as well.\u000a\u000aThe Chicago Dog was pretty good, but the chicken was even better...crisp exterior, juicy interior and delicious!  The sides were okay, but if you happen to be in the area, I would highly suggest both the Broaster Chicken and a Dole Whip float.

VLocated right next door to Mama Maria's Restaurant, you will find their adjoining panaderia where you can pick up treats for a sweet ending, or to enjoy later with some cafe con leche or chocolate Ibarra!\u000a,\u000aThere is a wide assortent of pan dulce here, and I also saw Flan, Cheesecake, Tres Leches, Eclairs, and assorted cookies. There aren't any prices listed, but we decided to try a Bavarian Cream filled Empanada, Peanut Butter Polvoron, and a Puercito which all came out to $2.\u000a\u000aThey were not the best I've had, but they were okay. The selections you may find at Mariana's or Cardena's may cost a little more, but the quality is better. All is not lost though...A Mexican Neveria(Ice Cream Shop) is also next door on the opposite side of Mama Maria's Restaurant, which is quickly becoming one of my favorite spots for desserts and snacks.

From what I could see, This is a huge park with lots of grassy areas, paved walkways, and multiple play areas for the kids.\u000a\u000aFood trucks were out. live music was playing, and everyone was having a good time.\u000aOriginally scheduled to go off at 9:15pm, people were getting restless because of the 100 degree heat that lingered, and Fire Marshall Bill, or whoever he was, said there was a "wind delay".....Ummm, yeah, and all of the other fireworks around us were going off every second without a hitch!?!?\u000a\u000aAnywho, after an hour long wait, (and half of the people were gone) we finally got to enjoy the fireworks show after almost calling it quits too!

VIs it possible to give 5 stars to a taqueria on my first visit? HELLZ YEAH!!!! We drove pass this place on our way to Taco Taco. After our A-OK visit, we back tracked and decided to give Taco Tijuana a go. Immediately as we step inside, The HOSTESS starts explaining the menu items to us...Cool!?\u000a\u000aWe step up to peruse the menu board, and the other two cooks start offering suggestions!? I'm thinking WOW, what service!? Any time I see an Al pastor/Adobada Carousel, that immediately becomes one taco choice, Don't forget to request it with pineapple! Another favorite of mine is crispity, crunchity tripas, so I request it extra crispy, along with a lengua. Wifey was quite stuffed from our previous stop, so she just got a cheese quesadilla.\u000a\u000aThe best way I can describe this set up is a condensed set up of El Gordo. They don't have a salsa bar, just limes and radishes but I'm sure they can hook you up with salsa upon request. The grilled chiles and scallions are complimentary which goes well with the tacos, and they're pretty generous with the meats here. The Lengua was topped with a salsa verde which was very soft, tender, and tasty. The Adobada was very flavorful and is way better than Gordo's IMO....The Tripa was served with salsa rojo and so perfectly crispy, that gave me the "Exorcist Effect"\u000a(You know, where Linda Blair's eyes roll to the back of her head?) that's how great that first bite was, and I was happy to find my new favorite taco de tripa in town! Stellar service until the end-they delivered our order to us, got more napkins for us check on us  periodically and even emptied our trays for us...absolutely some of the best service ever.Cannot wait to return!..... GET  THE TRIPA TACO EXTRA CRISPY....YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!ALOHA!!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(97/100) "New Taco Sheriff In Town"

VYay! They're FINALLY open! Food options are slowly getting better in our neck of the woods. \u000a\u000aOpen for Breakfast and Lunch, we opted for a couple of lunch items:\u000a\u000aDirty Fries-Kettle chips coated with Hollandaise, piled high with BBQ pulled pork topped with Cotija Cheese and Cilantro....Very hearty and delicious!\u000a\u000aTurkey and Brie with Apples on Raisin-Walnut Bread...if you're a fan of savory/sweet combinations, this is worth trying! Great service here is another plus and I'm most definitely returning to try their breakfast selections.\u000a\u000a Their section of daily artisanal breads is also very cool. Grab a loaf on your way out to  enjoy with cheese and wine, or if you plan to make more sandwiches.\u000aNote to the Chocolate Loaf...Your A$$ is MINE!!!! I will transform you into French Toast with Caramelized Bananas and Chocolate-Cherry Bread Pudding!!!!    ALOHA!!!

VGot to try these guys at the Foodie Fest this past weekend, and what better way to break them in then here? \u000a\u000aTried Da Big Baos which were like any Pork Belly Bao I've tried. Still, the best value is at Cheesecake Factory where you get the same set up for $5.95, but they're known as Vietnamese Tacos(Why? IDK???) We also tried Da Lobsta Balls which were decent but kinda tasted like kamaboko(fishcake) instead of lobster to me.\u000a\u000aI wish these guys continued success, and give them a try if they are on a street curb near you....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aYELP 100 CHALLENGE-(91/100) "Mobile Pho and Other Asian Snacks"

VSnow Ice has a lot of aliases-snow, fluff, snow cream, fluff ice, frost...they're all referring to the latest frozen Taiwanese treat that has caught on in Vegas. There have been a few imitators in the past few years(Easy Life, Icy Juicy, Kuma,etc.) of this "liquid cotton candy", and its just been one disappointment after another for me until a pair of abominable snowmen in the form of Mike and Will\u000aopened up and totally SMASHED the competition!!! RAWR!!!!!!!!!!\u000a\u000aNO ONE can touch these guys....no one's even close in the 702!!! I've mentioned that Frostcity and Snow Factory in Hawaii are the Gold Standard IMHO...Being brutally honest, as they've asked me to, I would put them right up there with Frostcity, and above Snow Factory! I did a consecutive tasting of all of their flavors (8 to be exact) in their small cups with no toppings, so I could get the ultimate taste and texture of each flavor, interestingly enough, this is the way Will and Mike also choose to enjoy their snow...all nekked, no toppings. I want to add that it was also 96 degrees out, and I still got to enjoy each flavor and its light, fluffy texture without it melting....now THATS the way snow is done! Here are my flavor compilations of the following:\u000a\u000aCOCONUT DELIGHT-For those of you who love coconut and /or haupia, this one is spot on! Frost Bites is the only one in town with this snow flavor\u000a\u000aEX "STRAW" BINERRY-Very sweet natural strawberry flavor, top that bad boy with some strawberry condensed milk and you'll be lovin' it!\u000a\u000a\u000aSMOOTH GREEN TEA-For the serious Matcha lover(*raising hand) may be on the bitter side for some, bit is exactly how I like it. if you love Matcha, you won't be disappointed!\u000a\u000aBLACK SESAME-Nutty and addicting, They Roast their own black sesame seeds, and its not a pre made paste. One of the original Taiwanese flavors, and NO ONE else has this in town! *Unanimous Yelpers' Choice*\u000a\u000aMUCHO MANGO-Very ripe mango flavor, very refreshing, no artificial taste, exploding with mangoey goodness!\u000a\u000aVANILLA DREAM-Delicious Madagascar Vanilla flavor, smooth and creamy with specks of Madagascar Vanilla Bean inside. Kuma's original Snow doesn't even hold a candle to the Vanilla Dream!  *Top Seller for those with a more Western Palate*(AKA haoles....:P) \u000a\u000aDUTCH CHOCOLATE-Ghiradelli Cocoa flavored, light chocolate flavor\u000a*Will and Mike have also formulated a Guittard Bittersweet Chocolate Snow for the SERIOUS chocoholic, and hope to unveil it in the future\u000a\u000aCOFEELICIOUS-pretty similar to Vietnamese Coffee IMO...They steep their beans for 24 Hours, and the result is evident...Javaholics, give this one a try!\u000a\u000aMike and Will's ability to strive for perfection(They've even perfected a Roasted Peanut Snow!) to get the perfect formula(4 key ingredients) is what convinced them to follow their dream and slowly but surely continues to win over fans. Yes, the location is not the best, but their product is THE BEST in town. Let's help ease their growing pains and help them succeed!!! .....3 words sums it up for Mike and Will-\u000a\u000a(K)uma who????\u000a(I) $**t  you not that this is the only place to get your snow fix\u000a(N)o one in town comes close to Frost Bites Shavery!\u000a(G)et the word out and help Will and Mike stay in town!\u000a(S)mooth, fluffy texture is what you'll get in every bite....No crunch!\u000a\u000a(O)utstanding product and service from Mike and Will...MAHALO GUYS!!!!\u000a(F)or real though, these guys are the REAL McCoy and they need to stay in Vegas!\u000a\u000a(S)now fans, this is the way its done...natural flavors and PERFECT texture\u000a(N)ow I don't have to wait until I go to Hawaii for my snow fix...Wooohoooo!!!!\u000a(O)ld Henderson is where Frost Bites Shavery is located...come on out!\u000a(W)hat are you waiting for???? GETCHOA$$OVAHEA!!!!\u000a\u000a(!)!! ALOHA !!!

VWESTSIDE WEDNESDAYS!!!\u000a\u000aI can now get my "liquid cotton candy" fix from Frost Bites Shavery in a more centralized location! Soon to be called just Snow Shavery because a bunch of whiner vaginers who sell shaved ice are not cool with the similar name, people can come to cool off with the BEST SNOW ICE IN TOWN! Also known as Snow Cream and Fluff Ice, this IS NOT shaved ice, shave ice(yes, there is a difference people!) or a snow cone, so don't bother trying to compare them.\u000a\u000aHaving tried all flavors, I always rotate between Coconut, my favorite because it tastes exactly like haupia, and my next favorites, Black Sesame and Green Tea. Hopefully they can secure a brick and mortar location soon (preferably in Chinatown) and if you haven't already, grab your tickets for the upcoming pop-up lunch at Yonaka on Sunday, July 28th, where a couple of new snow flavors will make an appearance.\u000a\u000aAll natural, no powders, the softest texture, these guys are truly the snow kings!!! Thanks Will and Mike!       ALOHA!!!

VChef Josh Green has given the people a very good reason to drive to this out-of-the-way location just a little past Larry Flynt's Hustler Club. Once only exclusive to his VIP clientele consisting of high profile musicians and celebrities, we can all enjoy some of his tasty creations at Skinnyfats.\u000a\u000aThere is something for everyone here, whether you're watching your weight, trying to live a healthier lifestyle, or if you just want some feel good comforting food, you can find it here. Unfortunately for those who are off on the weekends they are closed to the public and reserve the weekends for catering functions. Business hours are Monday through Friday, 8am-8pm.\u000a\u000aI decided to pop in one day before going in to work and try the Bon Jour Brulee(Their Version of French Toast)Two pieces of multigrain bread dipped in their "Creme Brulee" egg batter and cooked to perfection, served with fresh berries, butter, whipped cream, and agave syrup. It also came with two pieces of applewood smoked bacon. for $6.75, this is a steal, and a very good way to start your day.\u000a\u000aI also enjoyed my Sweet and Spicy Shake-Juiced beets, apples and ginger blended with banana and frozen yogurt-YUM! Shakes are offered in two sizes(24 and 32oz) and you have your additional choice of soy milk, 2%, frozen yogurt, or vanilla ice cream. Great first visit, and next on my hit list is either the burger or the Chicken and Waffles, their secret menu item.....ALOHA!!!

VWe worked up a hunger at the gym and up the street, there just happened to be a Grand Opening for Caf Zupas so we figured, why not?\u000a\u000aThere was a line out the door for one reason-50% off your bill....WHAT!?!?!? Luckily the line moved swiftly and I was already in attack mode! Their system is quick, easy, and painless:\u000a\u000a1) Order your salads and sandwiches\u000a2) Order your soups(toppings are additional charge)\u000a3)Order desserts and drinks....pay for your order\u000a\u000aAfter you pay for your order, a worker is waiting at the end of the line offering to take your tray to your table for you!?!? Oh, and each order comes with a chocolate covered strawberry, so if you choose not to get a dessert, you still end your meal with something sweet....:)\u000a\u000aHere's what we got:\u000aNuts About Berries Salad\u000aBerry Mango Salad\u000aBBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich\u000aCrab and Avocado Panini\u000aCauliflower Soup\u000aLobster Bisque\u000aRocky Road Brownie\u000aSalted Caramel Crme Brulee\u000a\u000aEverything was tasty, and the price for all this???? Just over $13 dollars!\u000aGreat for the kids too, and Zupas won't break the bank either. Another unheard of thing is that they DO NOT accept tips AND they will clean up after you too! Hey, they may be on to something positive???? Welcome to the 702 Caf Zupas! Now if only the folks at Chik-Fil-A follow your lead(CZ is out of Utah) that could be another win-win situation!   ALOHA!!!

VStop #1 of our Chinatown Crawl.....\u000a\u000aWe stopped in for a late night bite and decided to check it out. we were a pretty big party, and there was barely anyone inside. It was pretty weak on their part that they didn't allow us to put tables together. It was either "that table" or "that booth in the corner"...sad, but whatevs....\u000a\u000aThe menu looked like someone's typewritten homework that was kinda crumpled up, and there were tons of items to choose from with no pictures, but I'm no expert on Szechuan/Shanghainese/Taiwanese Cuisine, Otherwise I'd have to order items and use the force like Luke Skywalker which would have ended up in a complete disaster and thank goodness we were fortunate to dine with Tony T, Christina W. and Team Snow Shavery to help us navigate our choices. WHEW!\u000a\u000aFrom what I remember, all the food we had was good. We had the stir fried House Special Noodles, Pork Belly with Preserved Vegetables, Stir Fried Eggplant, Garlic Chicken Wings, Cucumber Salad, and Batter Fried Fish. Standouts for me were the wings and Eggplant. Overall, a great first visit, and looking forward to trying other stuff...ALOHA!!!

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(125/365) "Sweet Shop in the Southwest"\u000a\u000aThis shop not only sells ice cream and boba like their name says, they've got Seasoned Fries, Shave Ice, Snow Ice, candies, snacks, and LOTS of it!\u000aThey have an extensive amount of ice cream that is made in-house, and I was immediately drawn to the Asian flavors.\u000a\u000aI got Avocado and Taro because those are my favorite Boba smoothie flavors as well, and I also got Lychee and Black Sesame. Wifey got Some Seasoned Waffle Cut Fries and a Boba Milk Tea which she enjoyed. I thought that Fry machine was pretty cool, and how it worked, totally different then your usual french fry set-up. My lychee and black sesame Ice cream was good, but the texture of melted and re-frozen ice cream is what the avocado and taro tasted like...:(\u000a\u000aWe may stop in for another try if we are in the area, but with Art of Flavors and Luv-It in a more centralized location and serving up a better tasting product, it may be difficult to do.

VAfter trying Rachel's in Summerlin, I'm so happy we now have one in our hood!\u000aToday was opening day, and we met up with neighbors Christina W. and Arvin C. for a little Din-din.\u000a\u000aThe Menu is exactly the same as all of the other locations, and last time I tried their BBQ Chicken Wrap and Hawaiian Bliss Smoothie. This time, I went with their Sauted Mushroom Cheeseburger and an Incredible Hulk Smoothie. I don't know about you, but I like my meats pink and perfectly medium rare. Unfortunately, all burgers here are cooked Medium to Cardboard...You have been warned\u000a\u000aThe burger was okay, but Wifey's 440 Sandwich was very tasty. I will be back, not for a burger, but for other menu items. Welcome to the neighborhood Rachel's Kitchen!   ALOHA!!!

VAlmondcado.....not a familiar combination you'd see anywhere, but what that name fails to mention is that blueberries are also included in this very delicious smoothie(man, the blueberries are good for you too, but they must be feelin' hella butt hurt not being part of the smoothie's name!?) along with almond milk and avocados.\u000a\u000aANY WAY......A bunch of us braved the heat and came out for the grand opening of For Goodness Shake, a new shake/smoothie/sweet shop located just across the LVAC on Flamingo and 215. "Indulge with a purpose" is their mission statement which is great because for every shake or smoothie purchased, a child gets a meal through Three Square Food Bank, a great way to help the less fortunate in our community.\u000a\u000aPerusing the menu, the shakes screamed one thing....SUGAR. that made my teeth cringe reading the topping selections(candies, cookies, cereals, etc.), so I looked over to the smoothies side, and I love avocado anything, so I went with the Almondcado which was nice and thick, and had just the right sweetness. As the evening went on, more people came, and their soft serve supply for their shakes and smoothies got depleted in no time.\u000a\u000aThat's where it kinda went downhill....more base was poured into the machines but didn't have sufficient time to do its thing and freeze to the right consistency. Shakes were runny, lines were still long and I overheard that the shakes were on the too sweet side, and some needed a water chaser. Even worse, some ended up getting a stomach ache\u000abecause of the unfrozen soft serve...Yikes!\u000a\u000aLuckily for me, I was one of the earlier customers and I chose a smoothie over a shake.\u000aI will return, but FYI, test their soft serve before placing your order....ALOHA!!!

VSooooo happy that these guys didn't disappear for good! They just outgrew that space at the gas station and have now been situated at N Decatur and Lake Mead in the slightly bigger parking lot of Billy Mac's Auto Shop. They even brought their regulars with them, because even this lot was PACKED!\u000a\u000aThe items at Sinaloa are the same, and they even have a little hot dog cart off to the side, but it ain't anything like those yummy LA street dogs! Prices are also the same:\u000a\u000aTacos:\u000aAsada, Al Pastor, Cabeza (*Their specialty), and Chorizo $1.50\u000aLengua and Tripas $2\u000a\u000aBurritos, Tortas, and Quesadillas:\u000aAsada, Al Pastor, Cabeza, and Chorizo $5.00\u000aLengua and Tripas $6.50\u000a\u000aMulitas: $4-6\u000a\u000aAccording to the girl taking our order, their business hours are:\u000a6pm-Midnight  Monday-Thursday\u000a6pm-1am Friday-Sunday\u000a\u000aIf you haven't been yet(of course you haven't! So far, only Me, Jade W., and Amanda M. have!) Sinaloa is one of the best street taco vendors in town, and they make fresh flour and corn tortillas on the spot....Can't get fresher than that!\u000a\u000aTacos are just as good as I remember, and get them TO GO....they'll pack it up nicely on a plate with radish, lime, and salsas for you...If you're in the area, they are not hard to find. They are just a few blocks up from Komex, and across the street from Thai Grill. Use cash if you got it, but they do take plastic. I would avoid that $1.00 credit card charge and get a bottle of sangria to go with your tacos instead...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000a***When the weather starts getting cooler, this will be the starting point for the "Street Taco Scramble Part 2!!!****

VAria employees got a little taste of Chef Shawn McClain's Five 50 Pizza Bar slated to open on July 4th, at the former Skybox location. I  was lucky enough to try two of the eight pizzas available.

VBeing a long time fan of Chef Mitsuo Endo and Raku since day one, I eagerly awaited the arrival of its sister, Sweets Raku, which a few people compare in concept to ChikaLicious in NYC but I must say I was hesitant about visiting right away, as I was under the impression that desserts were gonna have a more Japanese influence such as the flavors of Suzuya Pastries and Crepes, but that was not the case. The first reviews and pictures didn't really convince me to try Sweets Raku just yet, so I decide to hold out a little longer until menu items changed to see what else was in store.\u000a\u000aWith the recent addition of new desserts and a few supplemental items:\u000aCheese Plate $9.00\u000aQuiche $12.00\u000aFoie Gras Pate $18.00\u000aWhite Sturgeon Caviar $30.00\u000a\u000aI figured it was finally time to check it out. As you step inside, you notice a few cool things: The color scheme of dominantly white(Dining Room, Kitchen, Staff Uniforms) and silver with little splashes of red and other colors and the minimalist approach of the restaurant-glasses, plates, and  excess equipment are cleverly stored away from the public eye.\u000a\u000aHigh end Kitchen utensils, equipment, and gadgets in this white custom designed kitchen would make any pastry chef envious! (I know I was!) Pacojet for all ice creams and sorbets, All Clad pots and pans, German engineered Rosle stainless steel utensils, Flexipans, Silpats , Deco-Relief sugar molds and even that Matfer sugar pump from France($150) that Chef Mio uses to create her blown sugar apples are all high end pastry hardware. Like how Raku's bathrooms are a must see, so is the one here. Just go check it out!\u000a\u000aIt is also a mini art gallery in here! All of the tiles from Japan, artwork along the walls and in the bathroom, and even Chef Mio's edible sugar art of transforming hot sugar (170C/338F) into spun sugar nests, pulled sugar rings for your edible menu and blown sugar apples for the Ringo Dessert. That is truly an art in itself that requires lots of practice.\u000a\u000aThe servers here give some of THE BEST service ever, explaining to you what to expect, going over each menu item, offering drink suggestions, clearing and replenishing utensils promptly and discreetly and one of the servers even wrapped my menu so I could take it with me!\u000a\u000aOur first "amuse bouche" is the edible rice paper  menu after you have placed your order, served with a raspberry coulis.\u000a\u000aWe continue with a quenelle(football shape) of  the Mango Sorbet with Mint Jelly and micro mint which awakens our taste buds of what's yet to come\u000a\u000aIf you're a TUF guy like me, or a TUF gal (lover of all things Truffle, Uni , and Foie Gras) The Foie Gras Pate is a great start before your dessert prix fixe experience. four pieces of foie gras torchon are served with two pyramids of chevre, fresh honeycomb, seasoned puff pastry sticks, and toasted pecans. Rich, decadent, and OH SO GOOD!\u000a\u000aWe decide on both the Mt. Fuji and the Ringo which are both classics with an updated feel to it. The Mt. Fuji is a take on the classic Chestnut Mont Blanc featuring sponge cake, whipped cream, candied chestnuts, enclosed in velvety smooth chestnut paste. The Ringo is a take on the classic Apple Strudel finished with a delicious honey ice cream. The blown sugar apple acts as an edible vessel for whipped cream and caramel sauce. Both plates were very delicious without being too overly sweet which we both enjoyed. Delicate flavors and textures are  very common in Japanese desserts which are artistic in presentation, and seasonal in taste.\u000a\u000aWitnessing Chef Mio and her assistant construct each and every course is like watching a show right before your eyes.(ENJOY IT!!!) They have brought what goes on in a typical restaurant kitchen up close and personal, even making it interactive, answering any questions a diner may have. They both work together like a well oiled machine never skipping a beat, skillfully timing each step, moving in a synchronized manner building each and every dessert component meticulously coordinating as well with the servers and the diner, going more at the diner's speed to ensure each course in a smooth, timely pace.\u000a\u000aThe Petits Fours plate is our last course which is a mini bittersweet chocolate fondant which comes with rum infused raisins and raspberry and passion fruit marshmallows which are interestingly made using agar-agar powder instead of gelatin with a punch of their natural flavors to end your dessert dining experience. Here are some tips to make the most of your evening at Sweets Raku:\u000a\u000aSit up at the bar to see all of the action-ITS LIKE DESSERT AND A SHOW!!!\u000a\u000aIf you rather chat with friends, grab the tables behind the bar\u000a\u000aSweets Raku is not for you if your idea of dessert is under $5\u000a\u000aSit back and take in all of the action...Let your senses take you on a journey-sights, sounds, smells, and tastes will make for a memorable evening\u000a\u000aThis is NOT fast food! Savor each bite and ENJOY!!!     ALOHA!!!

VSweets Raku is becoming a hot ticket in town! With a 2013 Pastry Chef of the Year award by Desert Companion, and a tie for best desserts(with Art of Flavors) by Mr. Eating Las Vegas, Chef Mio is ON FIYAH!!!! While Chika Tilman at Chikalicious in NYC may have started this concept, Sweets Raku has definitely elevated it...\u000a\u000aWe arrived at about 8pm to an already PACKED house and endured a 45 minute wait which was perfect because the spots that cleared up for our party of four were dead center at the bar, so we could see all the action! There have been some changes lately...a couple of pastry cooks have been added to assist Chef Mio and her assistant behind the scenes, especially during crunch time. The menu has undergone some changes too. The Marriage and Mt. Fuji desserts are still there...gone are the Apollo, Veil, and Ringo Desserts. They have been replaced by:\u000a\u000aTHE ANGEL CREAM-Fromage and Pear with white chocolate wings and a pulled sugar halo\u000a\u000aTHE BATON-Chocolate tuile cylinder filled with  chocolate cake, passionfruit gelee, chocolate and pistachio mousses and a pulled sugar ribbon.\u000a\u000aRED ROCK(The newest dessert)-Raspberry and white chocolate fondant(or lava cake, whichever you prefer ;) with streusel, vanilla and pistachio ice cream, yuzu marshmallow, and vanilla tuile garnished with spun sugar.\u000a\u000aWe decided to share the Baton and Red Rock Desserts since at that time, they were out of the Angel Cream dessert,( which was back on the menu by the time we were finished). Again, we enjoyed both desserts which were artistically presented with great flavors and textures while not being tooth achingly sweet. I also enjoyed my Iced Latte which never tasted watered down thanks to a genius idea of a coffee ice cube! \u000a\u000aFinishing out our sweet journey, the Chocolate Fondant has also been replaced by a crisp warm cream puff made to order with your choice of vanilla or chocolate cream flavored with your choice of ganache, black currant, or strawberry filling.\u000aI will repeat again that this is a DESSERT EXPERIENCE, and if your idea of dessert is off a dollar menu, or "$20 can feed the whole family" at places like Mickey D's, Wendy's, Jack in the Crack, or Sonic, don't even bother coming here, and step aside for those who seek this type of adventure.   ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  5\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(41/365)  "The Dessert Diva"

VAfter more than three visits, I can say that I'm a fan of Tony Gemingani's Food. I'm no expert on Pizza, but of all of the food I've tried here,  I am a fan of his Margherita and Cal-Italia Pizzas, two award winning pizzas with simple, good quality ingredients that were good enough to defeat the Italians in their own backyard at the World Pizza Championships.\u000a\u000aOther than his wide variety of pizzas offered here, the Meatballs are pretty solid too.\u000aService has always been great and we haven't had any issues.\u000a\u000aWe're fortunate to have him set up shop in the 702 because there's always a long wait to get a table at his spot in North Beach, SF. Yes. we have a ton of choices for Za here in Vegas. and when it comes down to it, taste is subjective, and I would rather return here than ever go back to Grimaldi's(blech!)\u000a\u000aEveryone has their own impression on what a perfect pizza should be, and if you don't like Pizza Rock, its more for the people who do like this spot.

VOne of only two(that I know of) TRUE All-You-Can-Eat sushi joints in town, and possibly the cheapest price in town, Sakana is a solid contender in the AYCE sushi arena.\u000a\u000aAfter reading highly rated reviews yet again by fellow yelpers, we had to check Sakana out for ourselves, and we are glad we did! We came in for lunch and sat up at the bar with Chef Sai who is very personable and funny, yet passionate about his sushi. We had called ahead of time and asked what the difference between the lunch price ($20.95) and the dinner price ($22.95) was...they don't offer some items at lunch as they do for dinner so just do yourself a favor and go all in, pay the dinner price, and KILL IT!!!!\u000a\u000aAppetizers, Rolls, Nigiri, Dessert....besides the standard one per person Uni and Amaebi(which automatically comes with a fried head) As much as you want, as much as you can put away-half rolls too, so you can try different ones the fish quality was great,(Of course, the top tier fish are found at Kabuto, Yonaka, and Yummy Grill at W Lake Mead) and I especially like that for the Uni nigiri, you get the entire roe! That is something that Chef Sai is proud about, and from him being able to select the ingredients straight from the source, that's what allows him to charge these amazingly low prices.\u000a\u000aThe fish to rice ratio is pretty awesome too. I'd say he uses no more than oh.......about 50 grains of rice per nigiri, so you can enjoy the fish without the rice overkill. Everything we had was very tasty! Sakana also offers a good variety of appetizers, salads, and other side dishes that are worth a try too. Chef Sai has definitely done his homework and dined at the competitors around town to see how he can stand out from the rest of them. Although we stuck mostly to nigiri and appetizers, we tried the Sashimi Roll which was very artfully  presented, and was very delicious. Chef Sai also gave us a Pink Scallop that was in the shell and presented with mango salsa and ponzu which was on his specials board. I had room for half a roll more before dessert, so I asked Chef Sai to make me a half roll of anything he wanted to make it with, so it was shrimp tempura and crab in the center, wrapped with maguro and hamachi topped with red onion and ponzu\u000aI tried looking for it on the menu, but I couldn't find it...(it was a custom roll) "Which one is this one?" I asked. He replied  "It's the which one is this one roll..LOL!!!" Good times with Chef Sai!\u000a\u000aDesserts are pretty good here too. The Plum Ice Cream is delicious and so is the Black Sesame Blanc Manger. If we are ever in the area again and a craving hits, we will most definitely be back!   ALOHA!!!

VREALLY had high expectations for this "Hawaiian Style Chipotle" as other reviews say. Service was great and they also handed out samples of their most popular proteins, Kalua Pig and Huli Huli Chicken which were very good.\u000a\u000aI went with a Burrito, half Huli-Huli Chicken, Half Pulehu Steak, Seaweed Rice, black beans, lettuce and sour cream, tomato-onion salsa on the steak, and Pineapple Verde on the chicken side. I took a bite, then another one, and another one, half way through, the tortilla starts cracking(not heated long enough to stay pliable). the salsas were okay, but I was also looking for the sweetness of the pineapple which was lost. As I said earlier, the proteins were good, but I think I'll skip the tortilla, beans, and lettuce, and get a bowl instead. Poi and Squid Luau would be awesome sides, too! Just wishful thinking.....\u000a\u000aThe Coconut Bark was good though-layers of brittle, sweet dough, and chocolate with a sprinkling of coconut were ADDICTING! I'll give it another go when they set up shop in the former Slidin' thru location. Hopefully it'll be better the next time around.  ALOHA!!!

VWhat do you get when you combine the forces with one of  Vegas' trailblazing chefs and the kings of the snow ice scene??? 9 delicious courses of F@#!*N AWESOME!!!\u000a\u000aYelpers, Foodies, and even Chef Marc and his wife were in attendance for this first ever pop-up lunch fusing the creations of Chef Ramil and his team and the addicting snow ice of Mike and Will, where two exclusive flavors made an appearance. Guests were also able to mix, mingle and sample a few Sake offerings as well as a refreshing punch consisting of Grapefruit, basil, and agave syrup.\u000a\u000aThree different skewers "teased" our palates before even starting the menu items:\u000a\u000aGRILLED MUSHROOMS AND SHSHITO PEPPERS WITH BONITO FLAKES\u000aCHICKEN YAKITORI SKEWER\u000a\u000aEarthy, sweet, and smoky, these were a great start, some unfortunately got peppers with more heat than others, and the yakitori tasted just like my mom's Shoyu Chicken!\u000a\u000aLEMON GRAPES\u000a\u000aThis was a great palate cleanser for what was yet to come. Cold frozen grapes paired well with the creamy Lemon snow, and we were ready for more!\u000a\u000aHAMACHI SMOKE\u000a\u000aThe acidity of the grapefruit helped balance the fattiness of the Hamachi, and the heat of the Serrano chiles, fennel two ways and creamy avocado were nice compliments to this course.\u000a\u000aHOTATE NASU\u000a\u000aSweet notes of the scallop and melon snow offset with the bitterness of the nasturtium blossoms and juicy heirlooms tied this dish together really well\u000a\u000aSAKANA BUNS\u000a\u000aBao buns were deep fried and slathered with some unctuous Uni butter, and stuffed with a nice mix of salmon, tuna, and rainier cherries....Can I get a Foot long of this bomb sandwich??? The pickled veggies also added a nice touch.\u000a\u000aSUZUKI YAKI\u000a\u000aGrilled Whole Bone-in Mediterranean Snapper served family style...Simple, straightforward, and DEE-LISH! The cheeks and eyeballs were the best...:)\u000aThe Apple-Fennel Slaw and Crisp Yucca chips served as great accompaniments.\u000a\u000aBUTA TO KAKUNI\u000a\u000aBraised pork belly was also presented family style along with Belgian endive, boiled eggs, cashews, and a tasty Okinawan Sweet Potato puree.\u000aOur side dishes of rice, braised turnip and tempura veggies perfectly complimented our two family style courses.\u000a\u000aKANMI\u000a\u000aThis final course was a great finale to our three and a half hour  lunch. Chocolate Green Tea Ganache and the Fried Milk were the stars of the dessert course, and the balsamic strawberries, milk powder, and chocolate-coffee soil supported this course fantastically!\u000a\u000aWe were stuffed and satisfied, and are also looking forward to the next one.\u000aThanks again Team Yonaka and Team Snow Shavery....ALOHA!!!!

VDid Yelp Las Vegas just beat LAS VEGAS WEEKLY and SEVEN magazine food writers to uncovering another hidden food gem in town? By golly, I think we have!\u000a\u000aMenudo is the breakfast of champions and a well known hangover cure in the Hispanic community. I've Menudo'd well over 100 times whether it was in someone's house, on the streets, or in a restaurant, I've never come across a more authentic version, than what is served up here at El Menudazo. Located in the North side of town on E Lake Mead and Belmont(Inside the Belmont Square) There are no windows, just a big white building towards the back, El Menudazo plastered huge across the top of the building, and a Veracruz(Soccer Team) flag at the entrance.\u000a\u000aOpen only from Friday-Sunday 7am-6pm, People pack this joint to get their weekend fix for a taste of home, and also looks like a hangout for Futbol Mexicano(Soccer) fans as well.\u000a\u000aAccording to our waiter, the most popular dish is their Menudo Rojo, and they also serve a Menudo Blanco as well, with your choice of yellow corn tortillas, or bread. Depending on your appetite, there's a Mediano, and Grande($6.95/$9.95). Other specialities include Caldo de Res and Pozole-Red, White, or Green($7.95/$10.95)\u000aSopa de Fideos($5.95/$7.95 with chicken), Huevos con Chorizo($3.99 Burrito/$8.95 plate) and many others, like Deshebrada, Quesadilla, a spicy Beef Chile Verde, or a Pork Chile Rojo, both available in tacos, burritos, or with rice, beans, and tortillas as a plate.($2.95/$4.45/$11.95)\u000a\u000aWe went with a Menudo Rojo, and Caldo de Res, but with me being the Notorious P.I.G, I also had to get a taste of their Chile Rojo and Verde, so I ordered those up in the form of tacos. While waiting for our orders, a nice gentleman named Temo came to our table and started telling their story on how they got their start and that these recipes have been handed down through generations, no shortcuts are taken, and the taste is clear evident here. They also do no advertising, just word of mouth and have their website- www.menudazo.com\u000a\u000aWe were very pleased with our first visit and wiill most definitely be back!!!   ALOHA!!!

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(86/365) "The Hangover Cure"\u000a\u000aWe came by Menudazo for our Menudo/Pozole fix recently and found out that they had shut down their white building location and moved back to their original location just a few doors down and have been here for the last three months now. \u000a\u000aThe restaurant is a bit smaller, but the menu here is still the same. We started out with a Quesadilla with Chorizo, Queso, and Nopales(Cactus). This thing was pretty huge and as much as we wanted to finish this, we couldn't because we had no idea it was spicy chorizo and our mouths were ON FIYAH!!! We also shared their two popular dishes, Menudo Rojo, and Pozole Rojo. (Two sizes available, mediano $6.99 and grande $ 9.99)Both dishes were plentiful, hearty, and filling. For both the Menudo and Pozole, they also offer a Blanco and Verde style as well, but I've only had the red broth, but I'll probably return and try the white and green broths on future visits.\u000a\u000aIf Menudo and Pozole is not your thing, they also have tacos, burritos, and combination plates as well. Their hours are Friday-Sunday 7 am-8 pm and located in the Belmont Plaza. If you're feeling a little hungover from a night of partying and are looking for the best cure, or just want some tasty authentic Mexican food El Menudazo has some of the tastiest selections around. Give 'em a try!!!   ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  4

VChef Desyree Alberganti is so passionate about what she does, she won't accept nothing but the best, and it shows in all of her gelatos. She seeks out the best ingredients possible and transforms it into some of the most KILLER gelatos I've ever tasted! All natural ingredients, and no artificial colors and flavors used here.\u000a\u000aShe is more than happy to offer samples of any and every flavor available, and you can also sense the passion and excitement when Desyree explains the process of how each flavor came about. Prices are a steal compared to other gelato shops on the strip and are as follows:\u000a\u000a1 Flavor-$3.25\u000a2 Flavors-$4.95\u000a3-Flavors-$5.75\u000aAdd a Waffle Cone-$1\u000aCustomize your own gelato Sandwich-$4.00\u000aAffogatto-$5\u000a\u000aAfter all we sampled, it was very, VERY hard to narrow it down to one flavor, so Wifey and I both chose to share 2 cups of 3 flavors. We decided on all gelato flavors: White Coffee Bean-(DAY-UM!!!), Milk Chocolate(OH YEAH!), and Fiori Di Latte(MAMA MIA!), Sweet Corn(OMG!?), Caramel(SINFUL!), and Strawberries and Cream(SO BERRYLICIOUS!). Each and every one had its own distinct flavor, and the texture and mouth feel is SUH-MOOOTH!!!! We will most definitely be back for more, and these three words sum up Chef Desyree:\u000a\u000a(Q)uestions about any flavor? Chef Desyree will be happy to answer them!\u000a(U)nique gelato flavors here-Sweet Corn, Avocado, Chocolate-Chili de Arbol?...YUM!\u000a(E)very gelato we sampled was AWESOME!\u000a(E)ach sorbetto we tried was so refreshing, and the Chocolate Sorbettto? WOW!!!\u000a(N)elson Q. (That's me!) proudly gives Art of Flavors 5 STARS! *****\u000a\u000a(O)f all The gelato spots in town, Art of Flavors has to be one of the best\u000a(F)iori Di Latte, Sweet  Corn, and White Coffee Bean are my favorites right now\u000a\u000a(G)reat product, great sevice.....can't beat that!\u000a(E)very flavor is carefully researched and executed before being served-LOVE IT!\u000a(L)ocated next door to Viva Las Arepas-Las Vegas Blvd. and Oakey\u000a(A)vocado gelato is a flavor I need to return for, as well as her other unique flavors\u000a(T)hank You Chef Desyree for serving up some of  THE BEST gelato in town!....:)\u000a(O)h man, I better end this review quick, and Leave the White Coffee Bean, Fiori Di    Latte, and Sweet Corn, and no one gets hurt...Nah, JUST KIDDING!!!...:p\u000a\u000a(!)!!ALOHA!!!

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(151/365) "La Reina De La Gelateria"\u000a\u000a10 months later and still maintaining a 5 star average is not an easy task by any means. The dedication and drive That Desyree and her family posses is unmatched.\u000aDay in, day out serving some of the best sweets in town six days a week showing no signs of slowing down, the quality, creativity and consistency is what keeps people constantly coming back and making them die hard fans in the process.\u000a\u000aI am also a big fan of Desyree's approach to push the envelope and think outside the box of your usual, safe, and familiar flavors-Smoked Salmon?,Tomato-Basil? Pear-Gorgonzola?, Foie Gras? Brie and Bacon Marmalade? All unconventional, and all bomb.com. I'm always gonna remember the first three flavors I was hooked on(Fiori Di Latte, Sweet Corn, and White Coffee Bean, but having tried just about every flavor she's ever put out since day one, my new favorites would have to be the Foie, Cabernet Raspberry, Cookie Butter, and Yuzu Blueberry, with every other flavor not far behind.\u000a\u000aThe" adult line" of flavors is also killer too.(Sorry kids!) Bailey's Irish Cream, Cabernet Raspberry, Strawberry Margarita(Man was that good!) How's about throwing some whipped cream vodka into your Killer Arancia Sorbet for a Creamsicle for adults? Or even a Moscow Mule Sorbet? Hint hint..;) The Vegas summer heat is finally here and its the perfect time to hit up art of flavors if you haven't already...GO NOW!!!   ALOHA!!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/   \u005cuuu/   \u005cuuu/   \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  10\u000a\u000a5 stars just ain't enough...Ready for Round 2 Sense of TASTE when you are Desy! :)

VEchoing the sentiments of my fellow Yelpers, Echo & Rig deserves all the praise its been getting lately, and no, none of these reviews are rigged!(At least I don't think they are!)\u000a\u000aArriving a bit early, I perused the butcher shop and deli sections while sipping on some Ballast Point Pale Ale that a representative was passing out to guests. When everyone was present, we were directed upstairs to the main dining room and brought to our table.\u000a\u000a I liked the atmosphere almost instantly-from the beautiful chandelier to the hustle and bustle of the open kitchen, the nice patio dining area, and every service staff member that we came in contact with was not only pleasant and welcoming, but everyone had smiles on their faces! A simple smile does wonders to add to your overall dining experience, and it most certainly did for our party of four throughout the evening.\u000a\u000aOur server Nicholas did a fantastic job from beginning to end, answering any questions regarding any selection on the menu, highlighting popular menu items, and even suggesting his personal favorites. We followed Nicholas' lead and shared a couple of appetizers family style, and selected our own entrees and a couple of side dishes (which we shared as well because we're family like that...;)\u000a\u000aWe started with the Bone Marrow Carne Asada, Portobello Fries with Basil Aioli, and the Grilled Octopus with Green Olives and Gigante Beans. Each dish had its own distinct flavor and was gone in no time! I'm no Carniwhore(more of a Sushitarian...:p) but when I'm in the mood for bovine, my preferred piece of meat is the very underrated Hanger(not Hangar!) Steak, medium rare of course. I do agree with Norm however that I don't like my meat cut for me...I'll do it myself thank you! For those of you who need more meat in your life, ask your server to bring over the bone-in  butchers cut tray.( I believe the Tomahawk steaks were going for $2.45/ounce) My Hanger Steak was perfectly pink in each bite. Our table also shared the Kale and Mashed Potatoes. Wifey's Lamb Chops and Regina's Trenne Pasta were also just as delicious!\u000a\u000aFor dessert, our table shared both the Turtle Sundae and the Berry Shortcake Sundae. Both sundaes were good, but our table preferred the Turtle one a bit better! Overall, a great first visit and most certainly not the last! I can't wait to return for brunch!  Oh, No corkage fee too! BONUS!!!!  ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  5\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(14/365) " A Great Reason to Come to Tivoli Village"

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(131/365) "The Unhappy Hour"\u000a\u000aUpdate for Reverse Happy Hour:\u000a\u000aWhat is advertised: Mon-Sat. 10 pm-1 am\u000a$1.99 Steak and Eggs\u000a$1.99 Shrimp Cocktail\u000a$1.00 Hot Dogs\u000a\u000aFree Cocktail for the ladies\u000aFree double upgrade on premium well drinks for the gentlemen\u000a$10 pitchers of beer\u000a\u000aSometimes, you just want a little snacky-snack and not a heavy dinner especially this late at night. We happened to be in the area on TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS...\u000a\u000aOn our first attempt, we call in just to confirm that they are doing happy hour. The woman on the other line says yes, gives us a rundown of the days, hours, items, etc. \u000aUpon arrival, the hostess(maybe the same person we spoke to earlier) apologizes to us saying that there will be NO HAPPY HOUR because there was a "Back of the house brawl" type contest going on!?!? I was so ready to brawl with one of the sides of beef  hanging in the butcher shop Rocky Balboa style!!! Did we not just speak to you over the phone? Or was it another airhead that we called where our conversation went in one ear and out the other?\u000a\u000aTime passes, and we decide to give it another go after a great evening(so far) this time, after waiting about 10 minutes one of the waiters drops off a dinner menu, and mentions that we can order anything off the dinner menu!?!? We try and get answers to what's going on, and I overhear him telling two other parties across from us(who also came for HH) that they are NOT serving the Happy Hour items. We express our disappointment that this is the second time we came here, and again we are denied? WTH??? The waiter AND bartender were supposedly going to check with the manager on duty to get some answers. Within that 18 minute span, the bartender whips up a complimentary ladies' cocktail for Wifey, and tries to get my drink order...TWICE and I politely tell him that I'd like to order some food first, because at this point, we still didn't have answers. We flagged the Hostess down and  hoped that she could get us answers. She disappears upstairs TWICE for a few minutes, and upon her return, this is what she told us: (**The manager on duty never came down because he was "tied up" on a phone call-at 10:30 pm? Right...)\u000a\u000a"The cook who manages the Happy Hour Menu had an emergency and we are short staffed, HUH??? The Hostess also softly "but my manager said it would be okay to order the HH Hot Dogs." What's this? A pity party/consolation prize??? At this point, it was just ridiculous. So you mean to tell me that there is NO ONE on the line that can duplicate the Happy Hour items except for the cook who went home? Let's see...there's the Executive Chef, Sous Chef, and Lead Cooks in each station...Three smaller, easier items cannot be duplicated, but you are still able to cook anything off a bigger dinner menu? It just makes no sense.\u000aIn every kitchen I've worked in, we served every item on the menu regardless if  we were short staffed or not. \u000a\u000aI'm even gonna side with John Curtas and agree that the butcher shop is not the brightest thing in that spot right now. Why not do like your big brother Bottega Louie\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz/bottega-louie-los-angeles and put in a patisserie??? Not only is Bottega Louie making a daily killing from all their desserts and pastries, they are nearing almost 8000 reviews which makes them one of the most, if not THE MOST Yelped business! It definitely beats staring at carcasses and cuts of raw meat IMO... Let's hope you can get some consistency in your food and service, but for now, I'm VERY disappointed in you Echo & Rig...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  2

VEver since Birrieria Jalisco in the Commerce Center closed its doors a few years back, I've been searching for a spot that serves up a good Birria. A co-worker tipped me off about a little spot on the corner of Owens and Lamb that serves up some tasty goat, and when he made the motions and explained that fresh tortillas are served as well, I knew I had to check it out.\u000a\u000aAnyone who knows me, knows that distance and location is not a concern to me, as long as there is good food to seek out, I'm there. Antojitos Estillo Michoacn Serves up Birria de Chivo(Goat) which is a specialty , and also Birria de Res(Beef). You may also choose to have your Birria dry, like a stew, or in a nice flavorful broth, and if you order the goat version, you can have it with just goat meat, or mixed with goat meat and other tasty goat parts....:9 \u000a\u000aChips, salsa, and a bean dip are given to you as you are seated...Chips were meh, but the tasty salsa and bean dip kinda made up for it                                                  \u000a\u000aOf course, I went with traditional, and went all-in and got it mixed as well. Wifey wanted to try their Chilaquiles which was pretty disappointing(read her review), just as bad as the Chilaquiles at DW Bistro. The Birra was very tasty, the goat meat and other parts were soft and tender, the onions, lime, and salsas added to this dish, and add fresh tortillas to that? Simply a dish that I'd order again. Hopefully we're brave enough to drive out here when another craving hits, or find a safer looking location that serves up this tasty delicacy....ALOHA!!!!

V*This visit was just THREE days after Tony T.'s and Michael K.'s 5-star experience....\u000a\u000aBefore meeting up with the gang for some Bingo action at South Point, we decided to get our sushi on here after hearing that they had good nigiri, kick-ass appetizers, and that the head sushi chef was from Blue Ribbon inside the Cosmopolitan. Already with high expectations and an appetite for destruction, we sit up at the bar, go all-in with AYCE.\u000a\u000aWe start off with both the salmon and tuna poke. The salmon was good, but the texture of the tuna was kinda suspect...gave them the benefit of the doubt, and ordered up some nigiri- Uni, Blue Crab, Fatty Albacore, and Amaebi. "The Amaebi is not good...too small" says our sushi chef......OH....KAY??? "The tuna is good" he says...so we put our trust in him, and dig in. Uni is good, Blue Crab is sweet, but the tuna lacks its glistening fresh appearance and again, I'm hesitant, trying the Fatty Albacore which looks butchered and is barely cold, almost body temperature...I chase that bad feeling with my Iced Green Tea, then I ask where the tuna is from...his answer?  Hawaii...after tasting the mediocre tuna, I knew for a fact that it did not come from the 808 State and that this knock off sushi chef was playing me for a chump! I much rather have had that smaller Amaebi, but then again, who knows how fresh that was!?\u000a\u000aLittle did he know that he was messin' with The Goyemonstah......\u000a\u000aLittle did he know that the Goyemonstah was born and raised in Hawaii AND worked at a fishmarket with some of the best tuna from our own waters...\u000a\u000aand VERY little did he know that The Goyemonstah wanted to reach over the display case and.....Never mind!\u000a\u000aWe ditched the nigiri section and ordered off the appetizer section-Miso Black Cod, Hamachi Kama, and a few Yakitori-Bacon Wrapped Quail Eggs, Bacon Wrapped Asparagus, and Bacon Wrapped Enoki Mushrooms. I expected Yakitori items and the grilled fish items to arrive on separate plates, but what we got was a pupu platter complete with orange slices delivered by the former Blue Ribbon sushi chef himself with everything on the same plate! The flavors from the Miso Black Cod and the\u000a "Ha-Ka"(Half of a Hamachi Kama, not to be confused with the war chant that the New Zealand All Blacks perform before they prepare to kill the opposing team) all blended with the Yakitori which was a big fail in presentation. They probably tested the other half of the Hamachi Kama for freshness? We ordered a some scallop, salmon, and saba nigiri, still just okay, and the cure on the saba was barely evident.\u000a\u000aI order a Shark's Tale, Wild Fire, and What's Wrong? Roll. The Shark's Tale mentions tempura snow crab...it is tempura imitation krab. Wild Fire Roll was okay and the What's Wrong roll was swimming in sauce and was alright. I think our Yuzu Sherbet and Green Tea Ice Cream were sadly the highlights here. No half rolls allowed until your last order, and only one dessert per person FYI....\u000a\u000aShady quality of fish, lack of presentation and witnessing lots of shortcuts(they don't make their tamago, and soft shell crab is fried, chopped, and prepared way in advance-YUCK!) does not warrant a return visit here....ALOHA!!!

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(71/365) "This Ain't a Stripclub!"\u000a\u000aAfter our spice fest nearby, we decided to check out the new boba kid on the block, Cafe Teaze. You have other places like #1, Volcano, and Perfect Scoop nearby, But owner CD and his concept has "Boba Babes" serving you tea with a "tease".. in lingerie/bikins, borrowing a similar concept from those Vietnamese coffee shops in the Bay Area. Kids love boba tea too, but Parents, do not bring your children here unless you don't mind them catching a glimpse...you have been warned!!!\u000a\u000aStill in the soft opening phase, Cafe Teaze is only serving teas right now, with snacks within the next week during the official grand opening. CD and the ladies are a very cool, laid back bunch, offering menu suggestions and even chatting about Cafe Teaze and other things like food, Travel, Yelp, and of course, living in Vegas baby!!! I think they even have cards and board games too if you enjoy that kinda stuff.\u000a\u000aSo how was the tea??? I was originally going to order the Taro Snow with boba, but there was no ice cream at the time, so I went wIth a Lychee Snow, and Wifey got her favorite, Boba Milk Tea and we both enjoyed our selections. My Lychee Snow was blended very smooth, and the boba pearls were cooked perfectly with a nice hint of sweetness and perfect texture. We also shared a hot Taro(powder) Tea and we enjoyed the flavors of that as well.\u000a\u000aThe walls could use some life and the lighting could be softened a bit, but\u000athose are minor details. Maybe down the line, reverse Happy Hour, DJ/live music to utilize the stage, and perhaps a larger drink option(personal preference) would be awesome. Overall, a great first visit and I'm looking forward to trying the food items and other tea selections as well.  ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter: \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  4\u000a\u000a*Sorry, no lap dances or champagne room here...try Spearmint Rhino or Sapphire

VThere are numerous places that have knockoffs of the real cronut here in the 702.\u000aI came here one afternoon in hopes of trying Coco's version.\u000a\u000aI was in luck as I grabbed the last two- a vanilla and a blueberry Dough'ssant\u000aas well as a blueberry cake donut and a twist glazed donut. After sampling each one, I felt that in the end, the dough'ssant had a pretty good texture, but was a tad too sweet for my liking. The other Items  we sampled were good, but not the best.\u000a\u000aIf I had a choice between Pinkbox and Coco, I would definitely  prefer Coco...who knows, I may give Coco another try one day....maybe.

VAnother local addition to the neighborhood!!!\u000a\u000aOriginally set to open on October 1st, 2013, Avery's Coffee is now in the "soft opening phase". Husband and wife team Sherman and Linda are the force behind Avery's, and boy do they serve up a pretty tasty cup!\u000a\u000aThe atmosphere here is cozy and inviting, I also love the sense of family here as we witnessed Sherman explaining and passing down knowledge to his granddaughter\u000aabout the pour over coffee making method. Future barrista at Avery's for sure!\u000a\u000aWe had some time to kill before a movie so a cuppa joe and a little story time sounded perfect! Wifey went with a Spiced Chai and I went with a Cafe Au Lait which was very delish! Baked goods, juices, and teas are just a few other offerings you'll find at Avery's. Sherman and Linda are also so very personable, they even were nice enough to offer us a little taste of a couple different beans they were testing out, a Brazilian and a Guatemalan coffee which both had their own unique flavor profiles.\u000a\u000aSoooo..."Who's Avery?" I asked....Avery is Sherman's middle name, a name that also runs in their extended family, AND the name of their little "Mascot" who has been included in many of Sherman and Linda's photos of a lot of their travels and life experiences together. He can be found by all of the condiments lounging on the CAFE sign and on the banner outside.\u000a\u000aFuture events include Coffee and Tea tastings for all aficionados out there! Give Avery's Coffee a try if you're in the area!  ALOHA!!!

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(109/365) "From Social House to the Suburbs"\u000a\u000aChef John Chien Lee has set up shop on the Southwest side of town and is fast becoming a favorite spot among the Yelp Community and you can see by the rave reviews!\u000a\u000aOur few visits have been during happy hour, and this is one of the best HH spots around town IMHO. On our first visit, we tried the Soho Maki, Tostadas(All 4 kinds), Beef Tataki, Albacore Sashimi, Firecracker Roll, Ika Geso,  Cod Lettuce Wraps, and all were delicious with the exception of the Soho Maki which is essentially annorexic spring rolls in a glass. That item as well as the Firecracker Roll was forgettable.\u000a\u000aOur Second visit, we arrived just before HH which allowed us to try one of their lunch specials. If I had to suggest one, The Soho Moco where Chef Chien pays homage to the Hawaiian Loco Moco is pretty bangin'!  A nicely seasoned burger patty with rice, a perfectly fried egg, and Chien's version of a gravy comes with a side salad and miso soup...All that for $8.95? Stupid, right!?!? Oh, the components are presented seperately in a nice bento box style, but to totaly enjoy the Moco, dump out the rice and make little bed, on goes the burger, on the burger goes the egg, then smother the whole thing with the gravy. Cut in to that bad boy letting the yolk ooze all over, and KILL IT!...;9  We also redeemed ourselves during dessert as we finally got our hands on their popular Green Tea Tiramisu (They ran out during our first visit) That was a great ending to our meal.\u000a\u000aThe service here is some of the best as well. Servers are very personable, and are quick to offer recommendations of popular items as well as their personal favorites Chef Chien himself even stops by to each table to see how everyone's doing and even lets you know of upcoming events and menu additions which I thought were pretty cool. Soho is closed on Sundays so that Chef Chien and his employees have quality time with family...Awesome boss points right there! If you haven't already, come by and have yourself some Soho action!   ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/   5

VI first heard MO5AIC when they performed at Central Christian Church during Central's numerous services service and from that moment, I was an instant fan.\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdOe0R29dhk\u000a\u000a Later finding out that they were based in Vegas and performed at the Shimmer Cabaret inside the LVH, we had to go see them perform again. Thanks to Roger T., we got to see the 8:30 show! This talented quintuplet consists of Heath Burgett, Jake Moulton, Josh Huslig, Corwin Hodge, and  Roopak Ahuja, who came from different parts of the country before following their dreams and forming MO5AIC. Vocaldrive(from their website) is the term best used to describe their sound...Music without instruments which is created by blending the human voice with digital effects.\u000aYou WILL hear beats, horns, sounds, effects, and even an electric guitar! Leaps and bounds over Doo-Wop and Acapella sounds!\u000a\u000aThe show is just under 80 minutes and includes a mix of top hits, blasts from the past, crowd interaction, and a cool beat box solo. One of my favorite parts is when MO5AIC does their Jazzy rendition of Take Five. With all of the accolades and exposure these guys have gotten,(Winners of MTVs Top Pop Group, and they have inspired the TV competition show The Sing-Off , etc.)I can only wish for a bigger and better future for these guys. If you're looking for a show where there actually IS singing, MO5AIC is definitely worth checking out. It is an all ages show where you're guaranteed to have a great time. Take advantage of the Yelp Deal they have going on right now(only $24!!!), and Valentine's Day is just around the corner...;)   ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  5\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(45/365) "The Sound of Vocaldrive"

VThere was much more to be desired after leaving this festival. Yes, there were alot of food options, and the cultural entertainment was aright, but things like a market section would've been great where people could buy Japanese ingredients(Japan Creek Market)\u000atea vendors, noodle demo, mochi pounding demo...something!?!?clothing, kitchen, and home accents(Tokyo Discount) I don't know, more stuff than just food vendors and an entertainment stage. There were a few people who also looked cool in Cosplay...was there a contest for that?\u000a\u000aA martial arts demonstration would've been cool(Karate, Kendo, Aikido) or even traditional dances too. More seating would've been awesome for both the eating and stage areas. Food options were cool, but were lacking in the dessert department. Perfect Scoop would've done well, helping everyone cool off, and even Suzuya would've made a killing on desserts and crepes.\u000a\u000aFood wise, we went for the out of town/places we haven't tried spots. We tried a Curry Okonomiyaki, and the first bites were okay, but towards the center, it tasted under cooked...Ramen vendors Hiromaru and Iroha were the longest lines, so we hit those up. Although I thought Hiromaru's Tonkotsu Ramen was very delicious, it was very skimpy portion wise. Iroha's Spicy Ramen was pretty good too. Felt pretty bad for alot of the local vendors(Sora, Monta, Kyara, Yonaka, etc.) as they didn't have lines when we were there, and we had half of Yonaka's offerings the night before, so we tried other spots.\u000a\u000aHopefully more improvements are made for next years festival because I am a huge fan of Japanese food, arts, and culture.....ALOHA!!!

VSo you got K-BBQ, K-Pop, K-Drama, and now in the Southwest area, a new K-Coffee Shop called Serenade(Ooooh...so romantic!) which has been well received by the Yelp Community.\u000a\u000aClean, spacious, free wi-fi, and outdoor seating...bonus! So lots of yelpers and their grandma have been raving about this Pistachio Latte, so I ordered that, and Wifey ordered the Chai Latte which were $4.50 each. The dessert case had cakes, cheesecakes, and macarons, but nothing that I was in the mood for, until one of the servers sells me on their Maple Story Waffle, $9..Ouch!\u000a\u000aMy Pistachio Latte was very creamy, nutty, and delicious, and although I'm not a fan of Chai, wifey's Chai Latte was pretty good. The Waffle though, was kinda disappointing. I was expecting a crisp exterior and a soft interior. It felt more like I was a farm animal chewing and chewing on some hay. The waffle itself is pretty small topped with vanilla ice cream, maple syrup, and toasted almonds really wasn't worth it.\u000a\u000aI will return for the Pistachio Latte, but that would be after getting a dessert fix at Suzuya which is nearby and serves up better quality pastries....ALOHA!!!

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(129/365) "Babystacks #3"\u000a\u000aChecked out this spot which is in our hood and seems like this location has consistency issues. Luckily for us, we didn't run into any issues with our orders.\u000aBabystacks is known for having Hawaiian style breakfast items influenced by a well known spot on Oahu, and If I see comfort foods like Adobo Fried Rice Omelette, and Loco Moco, You better believe that's what I'm goin' for!\u000a\u000aOur server Mike (who was also one of the managers) was great the whole time, offering suggestions, checking up on us constantly, and even took some time to chat with us and even after our meal, invited us back to try the Cookie Butter French Toast, one of his personal favorites, Which I've already made at home a few times...;)\u000a\u000aWifey ordered the Hawaiian Style Breakfast Sliders with Portuguese sausage, eggs, and cheese on Hawaiian sweet rolls and added on Bacon Pancakes with maple Syrup and I decided to go with the Loco Moco with a side of their popular Red Velvet Pancakes. They also had a Kalua Pig Benedict which sounded good but when it comes to anything benedict, I just do it up at home, because I have come to the conclusion that no one here knows how to perfectly poach an egg! (at least in all of my breakfast experiences here)\u000a\u000aWifey enjoyed her sliders and I thought my Loco Moco was pretty good. Both the Bacon and Red Velvet Pancakes were delicious, But my faves are still Du-Pars and the Sweet Cream Pancakes at 50's Diner. Wecome to the neighborhood Babystacks!

VGreat time of the year to come out and spend the day with the kids with all the arts, crafts, games, music, a petting zoo and food vendors.\u000a\u000a Chicago Brewery was on hand with their beer truck, and there was also a Chili Cookoff by Tivoli Villages' restaurants, but the big draw here was the Pie Eating Contest, where about 12 competitors tried to out eat each other with a Blackberry Pie courtesy of Murray Family Farms. \u000a\u000aFellow yelpers Niyen I., LJ R., and Molly T. competed, and when the time expired, A guy from Jojo's Jerky emerged victorious. LJ and Niyen took 4th and 5th respectively.\u000aOverall, it was a great time, and can't wait for the next one!  ALOHA!!!

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(170/365) "Peruvian Crack Sauce"\u000a\u000aEver since Inka Si Senor on Maryland Parkway and Che Inka Chicken on Rainbow closed down, I've been on a search for legit Peruvian spots. Located in the same strip mall as Cuba Cafe on Tropicana. This family run business is a hole in the wall, but that's where you find some of the most tastiest bites around!\u000a\u000aWe entered the restaurant and the dining area was packed with people gettin' their FIFA on (12-15 people...I think about 16-18 people is the maximum capacity)The tables and counter area was full except for one spot.....a two top in the HALLWAY  on the way to the restrooms. At this point, we didn't care and we were hungry so we ordered up right away. We started off with a Chicken Tamale, and Wifey's favorite Papa A la Huancaina. The gentlemen brings a bottle of green sauce to our table, and I squirt it on to my first bite of the tamale, and in the process, scorch a few of my tastebuds only to find out that it was the more fiery Salsa de Huacatay. Luckly I was able to extinguish the inferno in my mouth with some tasty Inca Kola. The tamale was a bit on the dry side and stingy on the chicken, the papas were the better of the two apps with all that cheesy goodness.\u000a\u000aIt was also National Ceviche Day as Amanda M. had mentioned,(What a co-inky- dink!) and that is another dish I haven't had in a while, so we had planned on getting an order of the Ceviche de Pescado and their speciality, a 1/4 chicken with rice. The Ceviche is presented with a very generous portion of marinated sea bass(not sure if the fish selection changes), red onion, sweet potato, hominy(I think),  toasted corn, and lots of leche de tigre(the liquid that comes from marinating the fish with the lime juice) great flavors and textures in this dish.(Definitely making this one at home too!) The chicken arrived with a side of beans and Jasmine rice which was pretty dry, but that chicken was juicy and delicious. That Aji Verde though...I almost killed the entire bottle! Can't wait to get all the ingredients so I can have my own supply at home. I'd definitely return for the chicken, and hopefully save room for some of the desserts.  ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  4

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(87/365) "Start Up Businesses"\u000a\u000aLove the cool vibe and the atmosphere here at DCP. I especially love when people walk right past the Giant Praying Mantis and get the CRAP scared out of them!  LOL!!! \u000a\u000aCool concept and great way to help local businesses get their start, but like other reviews state, the prices here are cray-cray especially when you know there's other spots to grab a bite that are close to DCP,  and doesn't rip you off *cough* The Goodwich, Tacos El Buen Pastor, Rollin' Smoke BBQ,  Art of Flavors *cough, cough*\u000a\u000aAHEM!!! *clears throat* Anyway, it's a good place to hang out after dinner(and after 9pm for adults only) The live music stage is cool, and so is the huge slide! Haven't checked out any of the little boutiques yet, but maybe we'll do so on our next visit. ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuu  3.5

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(148/365) "Dakao's Sister"\u000a\u000aI thought I already reviewed this place!? Well, better late than never!\u000aIf you're familiar with BA-LE Sandwiches in Hawaii, this location ain't anything like it.\u000aI came here opening week a few months back and a lot of things I saw looked delicious.\u000a\u000aOut came a familiar face from up the street(the owner of Dakao) so I knew the sandwich was gonna be good as I am(now was) a fan of Dakao. I ordered the #1 (Dac Biet) and a few other things, so when it was time to pay, The owner said the machine was broken(on opening week? Luckily, I had a Lincoln, so I just got the sandwich which was good.\u000a\u000aA recent clip on Action 13 News' Dirty Dining series featured Cathay House and Ba Le and went over various violations they had which caused both these businesses to shut down temporarily to "clean up" their act. Simple things like employees not washing their hands,  mold from not maintaining a clean kitchen, storing baguettes uncovered in cardboard boxes and food thawing outside with no refrigeration. These shortcuts that foodhandlers take is Sanitation 101. I just hate the thought of wondering about  other spots in Chinatown and other free standing ethnic eateries around town. You know a lot of these places continue the same practices. Its only a matter of time if and when they get caught. ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter: ZERO!\u000a\u000a*You are playing "Russian Roulette" any time you dine out, especially at ethnic spots around town which tend to take shortcuts when it comes to foodhandling/sanitation

Couldn't even taste truffle in the mayo, and the foie was random broken pieces rather than nice medallions.\u000a\u000aThe interaction between the cashiers and cooks are just about non-existent too. Seems like they just go through the motions rather than engage a guest, offer suggestions and sell you product, know whattamean???\u000a\u000aYou're better off hitting up local spots like Great Links in the Northwest or even Fernandez on E Charleston for their killer street dogs...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  2

VReally REALLY wanted to love this place as much as fellow Yelpers have, but in the end, I gotta keep it real...\u000a\u000aWe jumped on this 5-star bandwagon one Friday evening, and eager with excitement, I already had the Beignets and Bread Pudding picked out for dessert. Owner Gwen came out to greet us, and expressed how very happy she was to bring a taste of the bayou to the desert, and even happier about the Yelp love that SPB has been getting.\u000a\u000aPerusing the menu, they have MANY Po-Boys to choose from, and Wifey's favorite is called The Rich Boy from Gritz Cafe so when she saw The Gulf(SBP's version of a Shrimp Po Boy) She ordered that. I had originally planned on ordering The Swamp(Fried Aligator), but I asked our waitress what were the popular ones, she suggested the Bourbon Street(Roast Beef) so we went with a meat and a seafood option instead.\u000a\u000aWe both went with regular sized po-boys and thank goodness we did because I think they were sufficient enough for me and Wifey to swap halves with each other. You could also pay a couple more bucks and get double the portion if you're VERY hungry, or take the other half home, etc. The bread as everyone else mentions, is delicious and so is my  Bourbon Street po-boy. Kinda messy, but in a good way.\u000aSo I bite into the Gulf, and not only was this piece of shrimp not deveined as it should've been, but it had been in the fryer a tad bit too long, almost borderline rubber, not plump and juicy. The chips that came with our po-boys were stale instead of crispy, and it didn't end there. Although I enjoyed the piping  hot Beignets, the barely warm Cafe Au Lait was another letdown, as was the Bread Pudding. There was little to no custard evident. It tasted pretty dry, and all I tasted was bread and whatever brown sugar sauce covered it and after a couple of bites, I was done.\u000a\u000aAlthough service was great,  some of our food fell short of  delicious.\u000aMaybe I needed to come in for lunch instead? Seems like most of the raves came from lunch service, but for now, its just an A-OK from me...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/   3\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(54/365) "So-So at Streetcar"

VA bunch of us headed to Fat Dumplings after my Art of Flavors UYE to check this new place out. We decided to share things family style and ordered the following:\u000a\u000aTakoyaki, Chicken Wings, Karaage Chicken, Green onion Pancake, Chive and Egg Dumpling, and for the steamed dumplings, we had Shrimp and Chive, Vegetarian, Beef, Lamb, Pork, and a few others I don't remember.\u000a\u000aStandouts for me were the Lamb Dumplings, Chicken Wings, and Karaage Chicken.\u000aI also got an Avocado Boba Smoothie which unfortunately tasted watered down(stick to #1 Boba nearby) Service was good and attentive. This was just a fraction of their menu items we got to try. I'd like to return to try other things on their huge menu.\u000a\u000aJust a heads up and maybe what Ramsey H. mentioned(?) They have Durian as one of their smoothie flavors, and during our lunch, it permeated the dining room about two or three times when people ordered smoothies. Smells like dirty diaper..:(  ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  3\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(29/365) "Dumplings and Durian"

VLocated right next to the Wicked Spoon Buffet inside The Cosmopolitan, Rose.Rabbit.Lie is quickly generating a lot of buzz, very quickly becoming the "Place you GOTTA check out!" This retro-speakeasy-supper club-nightclub vibe just sucks you in once you step inside. Multiple secret rooms, random sideshow acts going on as diners enjoy their meal, live band playing big band music as well as stylized current hits in their tune, a lady hanging from the ceiling right above a table of fellas gettin' their Monopoly on, cool artwork on display, and even cast members of Vegas Nocturne interacting with guests before showtime.\u000a\u000aWe arrived for the 8 pm Show(Thank You Regina and Earl!) and decided to check out the bar. I'm no mixed drink expert, but our mixologist suggested her favorite, The Whiskey Smash. So I went with that, and people aren't lying when they say that some of the best craft cocktails and mixologists are found here! \u000a\u000aVegas Nocturne is from the same people that brought us Absinthe, so it is very similar without as much profanity, a little more mellow yet intimate, comical, sensual, and bizarre, while still being able to have one's eyes glued to the stage witnessing feats of strength, agility, and acrobatics for 90 minutes non-stop. I would like to return to dine here, see the other rooms, and possibly the 10 pm show as it is slightly different with some different acts, as well as a show at Midnight which only runs half an hour long. A movie director and comedian Brad Garret were in the audience as well.\u000a\u000aKNOW BEFORE YOU GO:\u000a\u000aShowtimes and Prices:\u000a\u000a8 pm, 10 pm, and Midnight\u000a\u000aRingside: $135.00\u000aPremium Reserve: $115.00\u000aPosh: $135.00\u000aMidnight Show: $27.27\u000a\u000aDress Code: No T-shirts, caps Sneakers, Shorts, or ripped jeans...basically, do not dress like a bum!\u000a\u000aPhotography IS allowed, NO FLASH, and be prepared to spend....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  5\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(39/365) "THE Place To Be Right Now!"

VWe almost always try and seek out new spots to dine on the weekends. Cornish Pasty came up and  so it was decided for lunch. If you dined at Komol, you won't have a hard time locating CPC...its right next door!\u000a\u000aIts a little dark as you step inside, two tops along the right side, cool usage of church pews for communal dining on the left, and counter style dining up at the bar. Perusing the menu, it was kinda nippy, so we decided to start with some cups of soup. Cream of Leek, Potato, and Stilton for Wifey, and Cream of Tomato for me. The Minion in me also spied a Banana Bread Ale, so I ordered one after our waitress said they had a couple left...only to be disappointed because our waitress failed to double check the bottles inside the Banana Bread Beer box...:( Our soups arrive, so we dig in. The homemade bread was delicious, but sadly the soups were so thick and salty, we only got halfway before calling it quits.\u000a\u000aThe Pastys(Thank Goodness!) were delicious and filling! Wifey's Pilgrim Pasty had all the flavors of Thanksgiving wrapped up in a perfectly crisp pastry casing. Equally good was my Chicken Tikka Masala Pasty-rich, hearty, and just enough spice to go perfectly with the Mint-Yogurt Sauce. The Toffee Pudding and Bread Pudding also sounded great, but we were beyond stuffed! Great reason to look forward to another visit. I will also pass on the soups but hopefully they have a new shipment of Banana Bread Beer too!

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(89/365) "Cravin' Cajun Reincarnated"\u000a\u000aA bunch of us stopped in as a plan B after we sadly found out that I-naba was closed for the evening. Restaurants these days have the wierdest names!?!? I kept calling this restaurant One Direction!? After finding out the correct name, it still reminded me of The Hunger Games, not a restaurant!?!?  Oh well....\u000a\u000aWe shared a few apps and started out with the Tamarind Wings and the Garlic Serrano Pepper Wings which were both puny in portion and very underwhelming.\u000aWe also shared the Beef Carpaccio which was delicious and the star of the appetizers.\u000a\u000aFor my entree, I ordered the District One Combo Plate with The Kalbi short ribs. I asked to substitute Vietnamese Red Rice with extra garlic. This plate was good, but not great. Nice taste and char on the short ribs, but unfortunately, the rice was red, but kinda bland and there was no extra garlic like I asked for. there also was pieces of Chinese sausage and a little pile of kimchi on the plate as well but seemed like it didn't really flow with the rest of the components. \u000a\u000aAfter getting a taste of Amelinda's Slow Braised Pork Belly in Coconut Water (SO FRICKIN' ONO!!!!!) That would be THE dish I would return for. If you have the chance, order this dish. Don't ask questions, JUST DO IT!!!  ALOHA!!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuu  3.5 \u000a\u000a*Little more than A-Ok right now with wiggle room for improvement...

VOne of the latest joints getting major Yelp buzz is The Goodwich. Not just any ordinary sandwich shop, but a DAMN GOOD sandwich shop! Jake and Josh know their s@#t\u000awhen it comes to food and it shows that they worked with the best. I like the fact that they use the simplest ingredients, prepare it the best way possible and stack them up right to give you a tasty BOMBASTIC bite!\u000a\u000aRanging from $3-$9, these sandwiches are totally worth it, and since you should be able to read the menu items and descriptions while looking at the pictures and other reviews, I'll just go over what we killed:\u000a\u000aEgg-a great, comforting breakfast sandwich with crispy bacon and gooey cheddar...can't go wrong there!\u000a\u000aFoie-anything foie IMO is bomb, and the combo of onion jam, cabbage, almonds, and CRISPY CHICKEN SKIN slathered with unctuous foie mousse will make any foie lover's opu(stomach) cry with tears of joy like a bee-otch!!!\u000a\u000aFluff-Nutt-S'mores who??? yeah, just what I thought...step aside, you've just been dethroned....\u000a\u000aGreat addition to the area with Art of Flavors just a few feet away. Nothing but continued success for Team Goodwich, and I'll keep my fingers crossed for the day they'll be able to move into that Donut shop right next to OG....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  5\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(66/365) "Sammies That'll Make You Smile!"

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(96/365) "Kool K-Cafe!"\u000a\u000aJust only 4 days open, this K - Cafe is the Westside's answer to Serenade on the Southwest side with a industrial, Pintrest-esque feel to it. One of the focal points of this venue is the neat VW Bus "tent" that you and your pals can lounge, talk story, and drink up in.\u000a\u000aEverywhere you turn, there's ton of stuff you just wanna get up and have a closer look at - a vintage typewriter and phonograph,  mismatched chairs and makeshift tables from mobile islands and chests, a glass head!?, VW busses upfront and on the mugs, and all kinds of knickknacks filling the shelves, along the walls and windows,  and the ceilings too!\u000a\u000aThe price point for items here are stupid cheap too!\u000aEspresso, Coffee,  Lattes, and Affogato $2-$4.50\u000aAdes, Blended Lattes, and Frappes $2.75-$5\u000aTeas $2-$3\u000aHoney Bread $5.50\u000aShaved Ice $8-$9\u000aAssorted baked goods and desserts $1-$4.50\u000a\u000aThe two ladies running the place we're very nice and helpful,  offering suggestions and introducing us to their stamp card system - pick any card, sign your name, and hang it on the wall (first or last initial)\u000aaccumulate 7 stamps in future visits, and receive a free drink. Cool right?\u000a\u000aWe didn't try any eats but we tried a Chai Latte, Green Tea Latte,  a blended Strawberry Latte,  and a Pink Lychee Soda which one of the ladies preferred over the Yuzu Soda. I loved my Green Tea Latte and wife's\u000aChai Latte too, even though I'm not big on Chai. The Strawberry Latte was pretty good and the Pink Lychee Soda with Pink Grapefruit Juice, Sprite (I think) and Lychee syrup was very good. Drinks are presented on a tray with a little ivy and a toy, just another one of Darak's unique touches.\u000a\u000aGreat place to sip and socialize, and if you're getting your smarts on, free wi-fi until 3 am. Hours are Mon.-Sun., 10 am-3am right next door to Sushi Koma. Come check it out!  ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter :  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  4

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(95/100) "Iraqi Style With A Bit Of Soul"\u000a\u000aWith the sad closing of Kathy's(AGAIN!) It left a huge hole in my fried chicken heart...:(\u000aI saw pictures from Ty W. and immediately bookmarked this place. Not in the nicest part of town, but some pretty tasty bites can be found here!\u000a\u000aSunny and his wife are an Iraqi couple busting out their version of Soul Food in the Sunrise area of Las Vegas, and seems like they're doing pretty well. We were jonezing for some fried chicken, so I went straight for the 2-piece Chicken and Waffles($3.59), \u000aWifey Got the 2-piece snack($3.99) which comes with a roll and fries. We also spied some fried chicken livers($3.29) so we tried those as well.\u000a\u000aWe didn't try any sides, but judging from Dyanna L.'s Review, I don't think their sides are made in house. The chicken and livers are pretty tasty and the waffle is made fresh(Syrup is standard Log Cabin , HFC stuff), so those are pretty solid selections if you do decide to give Sunny's a go. The seasoning on the chicken(same on the fries too, I think) may throw people off, and times be a little salty, and the bare bones place could use a solid cleaning, but people keep coming in and getting wings and chicken by the container full to go, and the price point here is not bad at all. \u000a\u000aIn the meantime in between time, I'll keep searching, maybe return for some wings or gizzards!...:9  ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu  3.75\u000a\u000a*Good service, tasty birds, and prices are a steal, but place could be cleaner...

VTHIRD TIMES THE CHARM!!!!\u000a\u000aYelpers came out to the South Point Bingo Room in hopes of FINALLY, MAYBE getting a winner!?!?! On our last two outings, our constant hopes of yelling that word\u000acame pretty close, but no cigar....We got situated with our games, drinks, and it was ON!\u000a\u000aOff to a slow start, we all patiently waited, daubing away and monitoring our machines, hearing the B word being yelled all around us, thinking "here we go again"  possibly being shafted for the third time with no winners yet again....:(\u000a\u000aBut Then.....\u000a\u000aBEEP!!!(The sound your machine makes when you're one number away)\u000aHostess Khatherine's machine sounded off, and after a couple of numbers later......\u000aBINGO!!!-Khatherine yelled, and our entire table erupted in cheers! Finally, we had a reason to celebrate! Little did we know what else was in store a few moments later...\u000aBEEP!!! Terri's machine sounded in front of me...and then for the second time...BINGO!!! Our table once again erupts in cheers, not caring that others around us are getting pretty irked as we are celebrating once again We all simmer down and resume play, and after a couple more games pass....BINGO!!! is shouted for the third time from Sandra. Our table gets uncontrollably loud, and this time, our table was "shushed" by one of the workers. OOOOPSY!!!!\u000a\u000aA great time was had by those who attended as this UYE  went into overdrive where we celebrated by closing down Art of Flavors yet again, followed by a three hour chow down at Yonaka. Congrats again to all the bingo winners and Thanks to Khatherine for hosting another great evening with awesome peeps and great memories!

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(70/365) "Sounds Like a Massage Parlor"\u000a\u000aThere's always something new popping up in Chinatown, and Hot Feel is part of the newest crop, located in the same strip mall as Kinh Do, waaaay in the back, surrounded by foot spas and massage parlors. Similar to Hot & Juicy/Boiling Crab format, they offer assorted seafood by the piece or pound, with sauces of different heat levels according to the amount of heat you can handle served in heavy duty pots instead of plastic bags as well as various appetizers, fried items, skewers, and hot pots.\u000a\u000aPrior to demolition time, you are given two pieces of paper as your placemats with a pair of annoying gloves that don't even "fit like a glove" and be sure to ask for wet naps which are up at the register(found that out after our meal) cause its gonna get messy.\u000a\u000aOur party of four decided to share the Lamb Skewers, Shrimp Skewers, Chicken Wings, Rock Crab, and Garlic Shrimp. The Rock Crab was sweet with a nice lemony accent, the Shrimp Skewers(head on, shell on) were okay, and while the wings were  hot, crisp, and juicy, I would've liked to see a Hot Feel twist to it, rather than just a cup of ranch, especially in an Asian restaurant. The standouts were the Garlic Shrimp(head on, shell on) which was packed with tons of flavor with the right amount of heat(we asked for mild). The Lamb Skewers were also soft and flavorful. If you come here, this is one of the items to try.\u000a\u000aRight now, they are running a VIP Card special for $20(no expiration date) which allows you 10% off your dining bill with future visits, and BOGO specials(This night, it was BOGO Crab, and if you post any food pic on Facebook(NOT Yelp or Instagram)\u000ayou can win a drawing for jewelry up front as well as gift certificates towards future visits. Come in for a taste and see how it stacks up to the other favorites in town.  ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/ \u005cuuu/  \u005cuu  3.5\u000a\u000a*Although the VIP card sound tempting, get a taste of their selections first to see if you see yourself becoming a repeat customer...

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(92/365) "Free Ride"\u000a\u000aSo we just happened to be "playing Tourists" at The LINQ and we passed the High Roller and inquired about their projected opening. The gentlemen at the door mentioned that Caesar's Gaming Employees had access to ride, then asked us if we were locals.\u000aWe said "Yes we are!" so he handed us a couple of tickets and said "Enjoy your ride!".\u000a\u000aAs you step inside, you pass through a couple staging areas where employees are constantly telling you "right this way" and "enjoy your ride!" then you take a quick souvenir photo(to pick up after wards at the sky shop). one area shows you a quick video and gives you a last chance to back out like a wuss if you choose to do the walk of shame. Lastly, there's restrooms to do your business so you're not holding it for the duration of the ride(Half an hour long) For those who wanna snack and booze it up during your ride, there's a concession stand to get drinks and snacks before you board your pod.\u000a\u000aYou are lead outside to a waiting area beside the High Roller, and when its your time to enter, do so calmly, but quickly! The wheel is constantly moving very slow, and hardly ever stops! Its like getting on and off an escalator. Inside, there's enough seating for about 10-12 people, and the rest of the space is standing room only, or if you wish, sit on the pod floor. Up to 40 people fit in one pod, but during our ride, we had about 15-20 people which was better IMHO....sufficient space to sit/stand and move around freely inside the pod during the ride which also allowed for lots of pictures which I'm sure will be more limited as it opens to the public and more people are allowed in the pods. I also feel bad for those who don't do well in claustrophobic settings. as this ride may make one feel that way.\u000a\u000aAs the ride ends, exit the pod the same way you entered it, but on the opposite side you entered from, You are then led under the High Roller to the Sky Shop were you can pick up gifts and even your souvenir photo if you wish. It is an awesome ride that everyone should experience at least once. I heard that it is beautiful at night when the wheel and the strip is all lit up. ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  5\u000a\u000a* I heard the admission may be $30 and the hours may be from 10 am to 2 am

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(135/365) "The Healthy Meal Replacement"\u000a\u000aThis is a great spot to fuel up after a a$$-whoopin' workout! Case and point? After a good a$$-whooping at Decibel Crossfit, I was beyond hungry and needed to refuel muy pronto!\u000a\u000aThe Juice Standard was the first thing that popped up on my Yelp App and I figured I'd\u000ause the opportunity to delete a bookmark then seek out a lunch spot. Owners Jaime and Marcella are two blessings in disguise that bring a much needed product to Vegas, as we unfortunately live in a city where GMO, processed and HFC drink options are everywhere, and the Juice Standard is a very refreshing option.\u000a\u000aDepending on what you are looking for, there are different combinations and blends to fit your needs, and there's even samples upfront for you to try before making a purchase. I tried a green one which was a little too grassy for me at that moment then a few more after that. I managed to settle on the Grateful and Excellent blends. \u000aAfter a few sips of the Grateful blend (I shared the Excellent blend with wifey the next day), I actually felt my hunger disappear! It probably has to do with the HPP process, and your body absorbs and retain the healthy nutrients quicker.\u000a\u000aThey also have juice cleansing packets if you choose to do so. Blends are $10-$11(16.9 ounces) with a four day shelf life(From the date processed) and a $1 deposit for every returned bottle. Give the Juice Standard a try and do your health a favor, ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  5\u000a*Sip and savor your juice...DO NOT CHUG!!!

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(171/365) "Finger Lickin' Good!"\u000a\u000aSo we returned to Brooklyn Bowl  the day after our Nerdy Bowling event for the Life is Beautiful Line up concert and party. Its a cool spot to hang out, get your suds and strikes on, listen to some live music, and of course, get some tasty grindage here!\u000a\u000aWe had an assortment of tasty bites the night before, so while we were waiting for the concert to start, we got a spot right up at the bar. Everyone from the Hostess to the bartenders were awesome from start to finish. We split the Chicken Dinner ($18.99, all dark) and I'm glad we did because the portions were generous! 4 pieces of chicken on white toast, collard greens, and mashed potatoes and gravy. Ever since Kathy's shut its doors, Brooklyn Bowl is one of my top 3 fried chicken spots.\u000a\u000aThe concert had started and a local rapper was featured and he was pretty good. The "surprise guest" turned out to be Girl Talk, which I had no idea was a DJ/EDM music dude, or whatever genre you wanna call it. It was cool, just not my scene. Looking forward to possibly seeing a show in the future.  ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  4

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(69/365)  "Hiromaru is HERE!!!"\u000a\u000aThis is the latest Ramen spot to open up in Chinatown, and after people had a little taste of Hiromaru at the Aki Matsuri Festival, Yelpers are making the trek here like a bunch of flies on a freshly made turd!\u000a\u000aIn the former Cafe De Japon spot, the interior has been redone with bursts of red and white, and the other half of the room still under construction to feature more Japanese Fusion items. We ordered The Carbonara($10.95),  Karaage($5), and Tate-Yama Ramen($9.95) The Karaage, although juicy, barely had flavor, pretty skimpy, and lacked the crisp exterior I'm used to having in other tastier versions. \u000a\u000aOur Ramen arrives, and the portions are pretty huge! Wifey's Carbonara is very good, as was mine, but the Tate-Yama advertised a double portion of the thick noodles....my bowl was more like one third thick noodles and two third bean sprouts. Banchan for days I tell you! Another bummer? Hard boiled egg...:( It advertises it on the menu, but there's nothing like SOFT boiled egg with your ramen IMHO....\u000a\u000aGreat thick noodles, and very tasty broth, but the kinks still need to be refined, and we'll definitely return when Hiromaru is up to speed.  ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuu  3.5\u000a\u000a*Great thick noodles with perfect texture and tasty broths, they'll only get better as time goes by...

VYelp Fit Club month continued at Dethrone Base Camp where a bunch of us came out for a fast and furious 45 minute workout which was taught by Ryan and assisted by Leslie. This HIIT style workout is great because it keeps you going, you work up a sweat in no time, your heart rate is constantly up, and you continue to burn off calories even after your workout. What is also awesome about DBC is that there series of exercises can also be tailored to ones capabilities whether you want to kick it up a notch, or down shift a bit and go at your own pace.\u000a\u000aA series of 30 1-minute exercises are separated by a one minute push on the Airdyne Bike which is cool, because the harder you pedal, the more resistance you get, then its 10 seconds to transition into your next exercise. What I also liked about our workout is that some DBC regulars were alongside us doing the exercises, so we could see how its done, Ryan and Leslie also went around offering pointers and giving everyone words of encouragement, and at the same time, the exercise app on the screens showed you what exercise you were doing and how its properly executed. Definitely no chance of feeling "lost"...\u000a\u000aCleanliness is another important aspect of any workout facility, and DBC is SPOTLESS! All equipment is cleaned down after each group is done killing it, and I thought that little attention to detail was great.\u000a\u000aBall Bench Presses, Box Jumps, Burpees,TRX Strap Flyes and Curls, Jackknives, Deadlifts, Planks and many other exercises had us moving constantly using different equipment(weights, TRX Straps, Medicine Balls, Airdyne Bike) and even our own bodyweight, and the final 10 minutes was core work on the floor. We hydrated with lots of H20 and Vita-Coco afterwards.\u000a\u000aBIG MAHALO to Drew, Victoria, and the awesome staff at Dethrone Base Camp for another ass-kickin' evening....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/   \u005cuuu/  5\u000a\u000aYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(63/365) " Down and Dirty at Dethrone Base Camp"

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(94/365) "The Topping I Don't Like"\u000a\u000aAfter our ride on the High Roller, we decided to visit one of the most talked about businesses at the Linq, Sprinkles. I know nothing about Sprinkles except that female judge on Cupcake Wars is the creator, Candace Nelson, I think, or something cool like that. Still in their newly opened phase, there was a line out the door. but it moved pretty quickly. To the left, you can purchase cupcakes and retail items, and on the right you can purchase ice cream, cookies, and cupcakes. Some of the poor cupcakes on the ice cream side were melting as a result of the death rays of the sun\u000adirectly on them.\u000a\u000aWe got  a Chai Latte, Cafe Cubano(Seasonal Flavor) and a Red Velvet. Being a salted caramel fan, I got a scoop on a red velvet cone to enjoy as well. The lady gave me a taste before serving me a cone to be sure I wanted that flavor. Their version seems to have a more generous dose of fleur de sel, but nevertheless, I still enjoyed it as the sweetness of the cone complimented the saltiness very nicely.\u000a\u000a Our cupcakes were all moist and the frosting flavors were not too overly sweet which was great...BUT......THOSE DARN FONDANT BUTTONS!!! They are like a sprig of parsley on a plate, a NFG...(Non-Functional Garnish) maybe make them out of chocolate because those things are pretty nasty tasting and like biting on a piece of hard plastic. I've watched people's reaction, and they either spit it out, try to take a bite of it without chipping their tooth, or simply set it aside....like a sprig of parsley.\u000a\u000aThe ATM is a cool touch for kids, as I saw Chef Mark LoRusso and his daughters give the ATM a whirl.Prices are definitely higher than other cupcakes in town, but quality of ingredients and the name is why they can charge what they do.   ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  4

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(100/365) "Izakaya Coca-Cola"\u000a\u000aAnother new Izakaya in town! Seeing other fellow Yelpers check in, it was only a matter of time until we had the chance to experience Cocokala for ourselves.Very wide selection from skewers to grilled items, entrees, daily specials and everything in between. The alcohol selections here are pretty extensive too. I went with an Interesting sounding Oyster Stout which had a similar taste to Guinness Stout which I enjoyed.\u000a\u000aFor the food, the complimentary cold Edamame was good, and we also tried the Karaage, Beef Tongue(plate), Miso Black Cod and three of their spoons-Avocado, \u000aUni-Nori, and Salmon-Ikura. While the Karaage was tasty, all the others were forgettable. The spoons were basically knockoff nigiri on a spoon, no one can touch Ichiza's Kushi-Tan, period...I've had better black cod at Goyemon, Sen of Japan, Ichiza, Soho, and even the Marketplace Cafe at the Cal!!! Shishito was nothing special, and the Yuzu Soda is nothing like Cafe De Japon (RIP) used to serve.\u000a\u000aWith the wide selections, and prices a bit higher, quality has to improve greatly to compete with my two favorite spots in nearby Chinatown....ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  3

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(142/365) "The Place With That Stupid Song!"\u000a\u000aThe first and last time I remember stepping in here was at our Black and White Elite Event back in 2011 when it was Republic.\u000a\u000aThe folks at Taco y Taco have transformed this spot into the hippest looking taqueria  you'll ever step foot in. I think what attracts people here are cleanliness. location, and convenience. Taste is first and foremost to me, and when it comes down to flavor, it's just okay for me. Having Al Pastor'd and Tripa'd well over 100 times, these are my go-to fillings when it's taco time,as well as cabeza and lengua. I will say that the guys putting together your order are very helpful and will ham it up when you snap a picture!\u000a\u000aOther good things I've seen here...the asada is done over an open flame, their tasty horchata is made from scratch and not the nasty packaged mix(free refills too!) and I like the offerings at the salsa bar. Not much of a fan of the cafeteria style ordering though, because from the time you hit up the al pastor guy, then the vampiro guy, get your burrito and street corn from the next station, then pay, then get your sides, salsas and drinks, your food will be stone cold like Steve Austin, whereas at a vendor, you order from one person, the cooks get your order out quickly, and you can enjoy your order hot, and all on one plate. To each his own...I guess...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  3

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(166/365) "Lego My Lego!"\u000a\u000aWho hasn't played with Legos as a child!?!? Everywhere you turn, legos of all shapes, forms, colors, and sizes, sets you can build from lots of different themes\u000adepending on your age, and even your wallet(some of these sets cost a pretty penny!) The Star Wars section is my favorite, as well as the different displays they have around the store.\u000a\u000aYou can also build you own figure and/or purchase a 3 pack of custom made figures.\u000aIf you have kids age 6-14 you can drop by the Lego store on the first Thursday of every month for a free mini model build while supplies last. For the month of July, it's a small truck, and for August, its a Monkey. Bring the kids out for a fun time and a free toy! SAVE THOSE DATES-July 3rd and August 7th!\u000a\u000aThe workers are very nice and helpful and will take care of any and all your Lego needs. Be careful though, you could easily spend some time and money in here! ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  4

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(157/365) "Novecento 3.0"\u000a\u000aWe were in the area and we were hungry from shopping all day, so we decided to check out Chef Marc's third Novecento location. This location seems a lot bigger than the other two locations and has a similar set up plus a bar area as well. \u000a\u000aChef Marc wasn't there, but Rob took care of us. We shared a Blanco and a small Chopped Salad which was more than plenty for two people. Service was great,  food arrived quickly, and everything was delicious (best chopped salad in town IMO).\u000a\u000aThey feature a few Gelato flavors from Art of Flavors,  as well as another company,  but any time we are on this side of town,  a visit to one of my favorite pastry shops are always on my itinerary for the day.  Stop in for some killer pizzas and salads that use quality ingredients without breaking the bank.   ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  5

Fukuburger followers and Beard Papa's fans don't seem to have a problem!? Personally, I would never buy anything from the ramen or Chinese spots, nor would I buy a boba drink out of a machine knowing that there's better quality and selection in nearby Chinatown. Hopefully Beard Papa's opens up other locations around town but until then, I'll be frequenting FAME whenever a Cream Puff craving hits....even more than Sprinkles!  ;)   ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuu  3.5

VYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(160/365) "Total Monstrosity"\u000a\u000aDear Ice Monster,\u000a\u000aWe came with very high hopes and a lot of excitement that you've been in  the neighborhood for two weeks now.Brand spankin' new, video screen of all your beautiful treats, nice display case showing off your pastries, desserts and sandwiches, view window of the kitchen where all the magic supposedly happens, and very comfy seating and games to play while we enjoy our drinks and desserts...WOW!\u000a\u000aThat wow factory snowballed for the worst as soon as we placed our orders. Your two servers looked very professional and seemed ready to bust out the orders like no ones business. I don't think they were ready when the Yelperazzi rolled in. Wifey ordered the UGI Milk Foam Tea, and out of curiosity I asked what UGI was. His answer? "Um, That's what we're(you mean you!?) trying to figure out..I think its a kind of tea leaf. I can try and Google it?" HUH? I also asked about their Honey Milk Tea, and he assured me it was delicious, and he had the nerve to confidently add on that they make their boba fresh everyday. Sold!\u000a\u000aWe all sat around a huge table and were enjoying a few rounds of Jenga when I look up to see what the hold up is with our orders, it was chaos.Two servers trying to get the orders out and through the glass window, the man who I think created the Ice Monster Cafe standing behind the scenes watching his workers take the fall, and seemingly more interested to get back to the FIFA World Cup, but he couldn't return knowing that we were right next to him and didn't receive half of our orders yet!\u000a\u000aThe five year old in our party gets a coffee drink instead of a tea that he ordered, Wifey's order was good, another drink was wrong and had to be fixed, my order came 20+ minutes later and was not a Honey Milk Tea like I had ordered but a Thai Tea and I drank it anyway, and the boba? The most al dente boba I've ever tasted. Not a very good first impression, but we wish you the best and hope you are able to work out the kinks...ALOHA!!!\u000a\u000aShaka Meter:  \u005cuuu/  \u005cuuu/  2 \u000a\u000a*one for the comfy seating, one for Jenga!

Located inside FAME at The Linq, we happened to be there on opening night after the Nerdy Bowling event at Brooklyn Bowl and they were offering 2 for 1 Cream Puffs-SWEET! \u000a\u000aI will save some of you the disappointment and say that you won't get rich, in your face sweet, ooey gooey from here....crisp, light, delicately sweet is the best way I can describe a Beard Papa's cream puff, and I love that the shells are filled to order so you can totally enjoy the tastes and textures, so if you didn't think places like Suzuya and Sweets Raku weren't all that, I wouldn't suggest coming here. You have been warned.\u000a\u000aThis is the first Beard Papa's that I've seen different types of shell being offered too-Original, Cocoa, Cookie Crunch, Paris Brest, and Eclair. I would stick with the original and cocoa shells. I do hope they offer more cream fillings in the future(Green tea, strawberry chocolate and caramel are all bomb!)
