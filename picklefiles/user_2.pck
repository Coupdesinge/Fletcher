VI haven't been to Sunset Station in years.  I went to a concert there last night and I took the opportunity to walk around and see what it  looked like again.\u000a\u000aThe aisles are wide, navigating the place is easy, and it's not nearly as large as I remembered it to be.  \u000a\u000aBathrooms are convenient to the Club Madrid area as were bars--although outside drinks weren't allowed in the club. \u000a\u000aTip for Yelpers:  I parked in the back near the bowling alley entrance and I found places close to the door.  It was an area that made leaving the property after the concert and easy and quick one.  In no time I was back on Stephanie and then on the 215 heading for Summerlin.

VI agree with the previous posters.  I stopped here when I was in the neighborhood to get gas and there is no pay at the pump.  I had to go inside, tell the woman how much I wanted pumped, show her my ID for the credit card, swipe and then pay.\u000a\u000aI will drive by this place in the future.  The set up is just plain dumb and this station aptly earns its name.

VI was in the area after getting my car serviced and I needed to pick up a couple of things for my wife.  Siri led me here.  Almost all Walmarts are the same unless they're older one.\u000a\u000aI found what I needed quickly, went to one of the quick checkout lanes that had NO ONE in line, and I was out the door in no time whatsoever.  Not bad.\u000a\u000aThe woman who checked me out was very pleasant.  I'd come back here if I happened to be in the area and needed something but it's the opposite side of the valley from where I live.

VThis is a review for the terminal only.\u000a\u000aI stopped here today to have breakfast at The Landings restaurant on the 2nd floor.  The terminal is really well done and fairly new--the terminal was rebuilt in 2006 by Clark County.  \u000a\u000aSince it's a small albeit busy airport, parking is excellent.  I parked in the first row near the terminal.\u000a\u000aFor those who fly in and out of Las Vegas using this airport, I am sure it's quite convenient.

VWe had a $40 Groupon for the restaurant and went last Saturday evening.  Our reservation was for 5:15 and we were right on time.  The place was almost empty at the time and we were shown to our table.\u000a\u000aThere is a Yelp check in offer for free bruschetta but you can't double dip on the coupons--either the Yelp or the Groupon--so of course, we went with the Groupon.\u000a\u000aWe were brought iced teas and a bread basket shortly after being seated and ordering.  The bread basket was a let down.  The one piece of lavash was more like pressed cardboard and the two types of focaccia were merely OK.  We did not get butter but rather a mixture of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  I have to remember in Italian restaurants to tell them to hold the balsamic.  It's just to sweet for me.  Give me plain olive oil and a salt shaker.\u000a\u000aWe ordered fried artichoke for an appetizer.  It was very good.  The dipping sauce was quite good.  There were 6 pieces of artichoke.  For mains, we each ordered ravioli.  I got the Lobster stuffed ravioli with lobster sauce--a house special for the evening.  My wife got the ravioli stuffed with butternut squash.  We both enjoyed our ravioli.  The serving size was just right.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I ordered a cannoli and my wife got the vanilla crème brulée.  Both were good.  The cannoli was fairly standard but I didn't taste any of the pistachio nuts that were supposed to be in the cream.  The crème brulée was the winner of the two desserts.\u000a\u000aI think Gaetano's is overpriced.  It only makes sense to go here when you have a coupon of some kind.  Service was good.  It was pointed out when the bill was brought that gratuity had automatically been added because of the Groupon.  I'm not a fan of that.  Actually, the server lost because he got a lesser tip than he would have gotten had I made the decision and not the restaurant.  A good meal but a bit of a drive from Summerlin.  I can get equal or better Italian closer and for a better price.

VI've been to this Starbucks once before and I find it to be a good option when I'm in the area.  What could have been better than stop here and get my four shot espresso on ice after a 6.5 mile hike?\u000a\u000aThe barista was working as fast as he could and the counter clerk was trying hard, but things got backed up because a member of the cast of the "Real Housewives of Henderson" (if there was such a show) was in front of me ordering 4 drinks and several sandwiches.  Since she didn't listen to what was explained to her, she had to ask again.  That was the one detriment to my visit today.  I wish I could have booted her off the island.  I know, mixed metaphor.

V7 of us stopped here for lunch today after our hike. 4 of us ordered bolgoki and the other 3 got variations of tofu soup.  We all enjoyed our meals.  It was quite filling and quite good.  There were 9 banchans today.  I was a bit disappointed that their spicy was less spicy than I expected.  Next time, I'll have to order the very spicy version for my tofu soup.\u000a\u000aService was good.  It is a small place that I have driven by many times.  The restaurant was very clean.  I will be back, and the other 6 feel the same way.

VI was in the area so I stopped here to get some things.  The frustrating thing with Walmart is their inventory problems.  If they run out of something, they have no warehouse near to restock the item.  Instead, when the truck comes with the item it gets restocked.  This means it can be weeks before an item is back on the shelf.\u000a\u000aI found that here yesterday.  A couple of things were missing from the shelves.  Unless you hop from one store to another you wait or buy it somewhere else. \u000a\u000aCheckout was very slow.  They changed checkers as I neared the front of the line.  Rule of thumb--if you see me in line, get in another one.  I have the ability to always pick the slowest moving checkout!\u000a\u000a*** 1 star rating to the McDonald's at this Walmart ***\u000a\u000aAt this time of the year, I indulge in an eggnog shake a few times.  That's what I ordered.  There was some consternation as she filled the cup.  Another McD employee came over and got some out of the tap and tried it.  She then added the whipped cream and cherry to my eggnog shake.  However, he brought it over and told me it was orange freeze or something like that.  They had no eggnog.  I left after getting a refund.  I hope he enjoyed the shake.

VI come to Trader Joe's for just a few things, and I leave with many more "few things."  They do have those lovely peanut butter stuffed pretzel pillows.  They also have great frozen minced garlic cubes -  a great time saver.\u000a\u000aI left with a lot more today for just going in to get a "few things."  This is my go to store for the things I can't find elsewhere.  I like Trader Joe's a lot!

VLobster omelette.  OK, now that I have your attention, it's a very good breakfast.  I had a Groupon for the Coffee Pub and I decided I'd use it yesterday.  I had viewed their menu online and I knew this was the breakfast to try.\u000a\u000aI ordered the omelette with home fries and rye toast.  The omelette was a nice size.  It was filled with the lobster and cheese sauce.  There were some larger pieces of lobster, but most were small pieces.  That didn't detract.  One wouldn't expect a lobster tail in an omelette.  The home fries were very tasty.  Good sized chunks of browned potatoes.  And the rye toast was swirled rye.\u000a\u000aTwo people, a man and a woman, took orders and brought dishes to the table.  Both were very pleasant and very efficient.  \u000a\u000aI was so glad they did the Groupon because I never knew this place existed.  Now that I'm a fan, I'll come back and try some other things.\u000a\u000aAs others have said, the place is a small, cozy restaurant.  I sat in the back area by the coffee counter where they have just 3 tables.  Since it was a holiday and offices were generally closed, it wasn't good people watching.  I will come back to sit on the patio and enjoy lunch there.

VI've been to Diamond Bakery in the past when I had a craving for something sweet and they've always come through.  After spending time at the New Year festival area out front of the mall, I went walking to check out the restaurants and of course to pay a visit to Diamond because I was right there!\u000a\u000aI got three pastries.  One was a square of pineapple paste in a pastry crust.  The second was a triangle of red bean paste, and the last was a very large and heavy durian mung bean cake.  The cake must have weighed 8 ounces as it was completely filled with durian mung bean paste.  \u000a\u000aAll three were very good.  My only issue with any of the three was the pastry around the durian cake.  It was very flaky--not baked pastry flaky--rather it fell off in pieces of light, white pieces and was a bit messy.  The cake however was very tasty!\u000a\u000aI enjoyed my stop here, the staff was very pleasant, and the pastries good.  That's what keeps me coming back.

VDefinitely an old school steak house and I say that in a good way!  I haven't been here since the 80s when we came here as tourists.  \u000a\u000aA friend and I went here to enjoy a tasty steak, and that's just what we did.  Since we were there early, we had run of the place.  We took photos of the different booths where Sinatra, Elvis, Sammy Davis, Jr. and Dean Martin dined.  The hostess showed us a side room where she said Tony Spilotro would dine and she had a story about a counter where their guns were placed before they sat down.  When she said that he was there only a month before his body was found in the desert (after he was murdered, he was buried in a field in Indiana), it cast a little doubt on the authenticity of her story.  Enough of that, on to the meal.\u000a\u000aWe both ordered the 12 ounce filet that their menu refers to as "the Aristocrat of Tenderness).  I ordered a chopped green salad with Roquefort dressing.  I got the jumbo baked potato that the menu bills as "Vegas' biggest."  Finally, we each had some chocolate cake for dessert.\u000a\u000aThe bread basket was simply some sliced Italian bread--nothing special.  The steaks were wonderful.  Mine was very tender.  I ordered it back and blue and that's almost the way I got it.  It was done a bit more than I prefer.  My friend ordered his well done--he's a Brit--go figure, but he enjoyed his steak, too!\u000a\u000aI only got butter with the baked potato and it was swimming in butter.  It was excellent!  My friend got fries which he described as chips as good as you can get in the States and as good as what he gets at home.\u000a\u000aWe both ordered the chocolate cake.  This was a bit of a disappointment.  It was a bit dry and a bit small.  There was no dollop of whipped cream to dress it up.  \u000a\u000aService was great.  Our server has been with the Golden Steer for years, and he was on top of everything.  Very nice dining experience in a classic Las Vegas steakhouse that has been around for years and years.

VMy experience here wasn't as great as I thought it would be based on the number of average stars Food Express has for the number of reviews.  We had a language problem a couple of times last night.\u000a\u000aI ordered the moo shu pork for an appetizer for the two of us and chicken with green beans for a main course, also to be shared.  The moo shu was brought out in a relatively quick time.  There were four plump pancakes filled with goodness.  It appears that Food Express used the tortilla like wrappers instead of the thinner, traditional pancakes.  The rolls were flavorful but before we even had one eaten, the server was back with our main course.  I hate that so much.\u000a\u000aWhen the chicken arrived, it was not chicken with green beans but chicken with broccoli.  That was a language problem or simply an error on the server's part.  We took the meal.  I wouldn't waste that food for one vegetable.\u000a\u000aWhen we were finished, I asked if there was a dessert menu.  The server mumbled something, pointed to the kitchen, and then left the table.  A few minutes later, he came back with two small bowls of warmed, sweetened red bean soup which was our dessert I guess but he never said anything more.\u000a\u000aMy wife didn't care for her dessert so I finished two.  I'm glad it was small.\u000a\u000aThere are many things on the menu I'd love to try but I'm a little gun shy.  I'm not sure I'll be back.  Spring Mountain Road, I think I'll go your direction next time.

VOn my way to see a play at Las Vegas Little Theatre and decided to stop here a fill up.  While the station across the street was a bit cheaper, this was easy in and out for me.  It also was the same price as Costco and there was no surcharge for using a credit card.\u000a\u000aI did get hit up by someone wanting money.  I ignored him and after awhile he went away.  This certainly is a good option if you're in the neighborhood and needed gas.

VI have had several watch batteries installed here and I've had some jewelry repairs, the reason for today's visit.  My bracelet needed to be soldered where the ring wants to keep slipping off the lobster claw.  A short wait, a reasonable fee, and I was on my way.\u000a\u000aI really do like the place and the people.  My only complaint is getting in and out.  It's along the strip side of Chinatown along Spring Mountain Road between Valley View and Wynn Road.  It can be a bit of pain, but I think it's worth it!\u000a\u000aThey'll get my return business!

VWe come here once or twice a year.  We used to be here often for breakfast, but that went away when so many more choices opened nearer home.  We go that once or twice now for dinner.\u000a\u000aI had the Popeye chicken--a chicken breast with spinach on top covered with cheese.  My wife had their parmesan crusted chicken breast.  We both enjoyed our chicken, but I do wish they'd get some vegetable other than canned green beans.\u000a\u000aBoth dinners were on their limited time $7.77 menu.  For the price you get \u000asoup or salad, dinner, drink, and dessert.   It can't be beaten!

VI got a second pair of the discontinued hiking boots I like here.  I think I'll have to go around the Valley and clean out the supply in each Big 5.\u000a\u000aI called and they had one pair left in my size.  They put it away for two days with my name on a tag.  I picked up the boots and they are just what I want.\u000a\u000aThe staff was friendly and very competent.  Good store!

VThree little words--red bean bun.  Such great big flavor!  While walking around Chinatown last night looking for a yogurt bar that used to be there, I came upon Sunville Bakery.  I decided to take a look inside.  It was late, almost 8 PM, but they were open and had limited things left from the day.\u000a\u000aI looked on a rack on the right and saw the red bean bun tag with one bun left.  I picked up that bun, paid, and started eating this small treat shortly after leaving the front door.\u000a\u000aThe type left was the flaky pastry bun.  It was filled with luscious red bean paste, a rich, dark red color, and sweetened just right--not too sweet to detract from the bun.  The bun was flaky and flavorful also.\u000a\u000aWhat a great find!  I'll have to go back and try some other things.  What a great find.

VI decided a change of pace was in order so I stopped here today instead of heading to the nearest Starbucks.\u000a\u000aI got a bubble black tea, unsweetened, and it was quite good.  There was a bit of a language barrier.  She was asking if I wanted sugar and at first I wasn't understanding at all.  Finally I understood, and I got my tea without sugar.  \u000a\u000aThe place is close to Las Vegas Little Theatre where I spend a good amount of time, but I think I'll stay nearer to Schiff Drive where it is.  The location of the Tea Station makes heading west out of the lot a pain in the neck.

VThis is a great stop!  Last night, I decided to skip dessert at Casa Don Juan and instead head for Luv-It.  I've been here before, but it was on my way to McCarran.\u000a\u000aI got the Rum Rainbow - one of the flavors of the week.  It was rich in rum flavor and the rainbow evidently came from sprinkles added to the mix that melted and left colored streaks.  It was very flavorful and very smooth.\u000a\u000aI really like this place.  Now if it would just move to Summerlin, I'd be happy - and broke!

VI had a Groupon for the Florida Cafe that was going to expire in a few days so I went here last night to use it and I'm glad I did.  My server was a delightful young woman but we had a bit of a language problem as you'll see during my review.\u000a\u000aI looked over the menu and I also asked her suggestion.  She pointed to an oxtail stew that's not on their online menu.  I opted to take her advice.  \u000a\u000aI started with their papas rellenas--mashed potatoes stuffed with picadillo beef and deep fried.  Presentation was very nice with two very thin plantain pieces deep freid and stuck in the papas.  There was also a small salad.\u000a\u000aThe menu said all dinners come with red or black beans and rice.  I specified black beans.  That was the first language mixup.  Not only did I get black beans with my meal but my server brought me an extra bowl of black beans because she thought I ordered an extra dish.  It was good so I ate both!\u000a\u000aThe oxtail stew was very flavorful.  I think some people might have thought the broth was salty, but it was just great for me.\u000a\u000aDessert order time.  I asked about the size of the tres leches cake tower with flan and coconut.  She assured me it wasn't that large and then she brought me the normal flan and not the tres leches cake.  Language problem number 2.\u000a\u000aShe asked if I wanted more Coke and I said, "No, iced tea."  She then brought me a Coke.  I didn't notice, but I soon had a table side science experiment.  You have no idea how Coke foams when you put artificial sweetener in it.  I managed to keep little Vesuvius from flooding the table, but I didn't drink the Coke.  Last language error.\u000a\u000aI'm going to go back because I really like Cuban food.  I'll also make sure that what I want is a bit more explicit!

VThis was stop two on our East Charleston taco trek.  At Los Tacos, you order at one of the registers and your number is called when your order is ready.\u000a\u000aI ordered a carne asada with everything.  The thing that distinguishes this taco place from the others is that they use two thin tacos, but one of them has been grilled a bit longer so you get a crunch along with the soft taco.  It's quite a nice contrast.\u000a\u000aWith the asada with everything, you get whole beans, guacamole, pico. chopped onions, and sour cream.  It is pretty much everything you'd want.\u000a\u000aI also ordered a cantaloupe agua fresca.  Wow, what a really refreshing drink and a good accompaniment for the food.\u000a\u000aThere is a patio here and we could have gone outside, but we pushed some tables together and the 10 or 12 of us sat at a long table except for Roger T. who was at a separate table with his kids and some of his family.

VEver since our UYE Taco Trek in February, I've been planning to come back for one of their seafood cocktails.  Last night, I left the main group of Yelp folks on the Trek #2 and I came here for my seafood cocktail.\u000a\u000aI was going to get the mixed seafood, octopus, oysters, and shrimp but I had a language problem last night with the nice senora at the register.  I ended up with a shrimp only cocktail but it was everything I wanted!\u000a\u000aI got their small size which is called medium for some reason.  There is no small!  The preparer takes a good sized mug and she puts two and a half ice cream scoops of medium sized shrimp in the mug.  Then she adds some pico, an avocado diced in small pieces and fills the entire mug with a tangy tomato sauce.  The pico is fresh cubed tomato, celery, and onions.\u000a\u000aWith this beautiful mug, you get a basket of chips with a half lime for your cocktail.  Also, the required hot sauce, in this case, Tapatio is put on the pick up counter next to the mug and the chips.  OK, you never have to twist my arm when it comes to hot sauce.\u000a\u000aI ate the cocktail in what could have been record time.  What wonderful flavors!  Now I know what I'll do when I get the urge again.  There's another Los Tacos on West Sahara, much closer to me.  I'll go there and get the mixed seafood, large this time, and I'll make a stop somewhere else, El Pollo Loco perhaps, for my gringa wife.\u000a\u000aSylvia and Nelson, the cocktail was as good as you promised it would be!  Gracias, amigos!

VI was at the Arts Factory tonight for a benefit concert.  The room was set up for about 25 people which was just right.  Parking was easy.  On First Friday's, the whole area must be filled with cars.\u000a\u000aI walked around and looked at the pieces on the wall.  Some showed lots of talent and caught my eye.  Others just didn't appeal, but that's art.\u000a\u000aI agree with the previous poster about the temperature.  It got a bit warm after the first 1/2 hour.\u000a\u000aI'm glad I know more about the place.  I want to go back and try the Bar + Bistro.

VKomol has been on my radar for about a year and I finally stopped in Wednesday evening.  \u000a\u000aI knew from looking at the menu online that I wanted to try a duck dish.  I ordered the duck chili mint - boneless duck stir fried with garlic, hot peppers, and basil.  After reading the Yelp reviews of people I know, I opted for a spiciness level of 6 out of 10.  It turned out to be just about perfect considering the dish was spiced with red chilis and several slices of fresh jalapeño.  Tasty indeed but not overwhelming.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I ordered the pumpkin in coconut milk.  It was fresh pumpkin cubes in sweetened and warmed coconut milk.  Very good!\u000a\u000aService was excellent.  When I asked the server about the size of a cup of soup, he told me it's generally too big for one person--people often split it--and I opted to skip having soup.  It was early and the restaurant was quiet, but everyone who works there was cheerful, greeted me, and had a big smile.\u000a\u000aThanks for the tips, Misti, Mamie, Holly, and Paolo!\u000a\u000aI have to go back and try some more.  It is good!

VI came to the Center last night for a program, The Legacy of Matthew Shepard with Judy Shepard, a program co-sponsored by the Center and the Anti-Defamation League.  My review is as much for the program as it is for the Center.\u000a\u000aI have been here once before.  Our Yelp book club met here one month.  The Center has good parking in the front and on the east side.  When you enter, you come into the great hall and the first thing to catch your eye is the Bronze Café, a sandwich and drink café.  \u000a\u000aThe program last night was held in a large meeting room to the right past the information desk.  The setup was perfect for the large number of people who were there.  The video and sound setup worked just the way it should and Mrs. Shepard spoke eloquently about her son's death and how things are changing in the US.\u000a\u000aI have to give a shout out to the designer for coming up with the idea of a gender neutral bathroom area.  It's very creative.  It had me wondering when I saw the sign "The Johns."\u000a\u000aThis was a great place to attend a program.  Thanks to the Center and the ADL for bringing Mrs. Shepard to Las Vegas.

VI became a big fan of this place last night when I went here for the first time.  It was just about 5 PM, and I sat at the sushi bar.  During the time I was there - until about 6 PM, I was the only one at the bar.\u000a\u000aI started off with some complimentary miso and a small bowl of edamame.  Good start on both counts.   For my dinner, I got an order of Uni Nigiri and their Tokyo Special Roll (Inside the roll were tuna, kampyo, and crab.  Outside the roll were 6 pieces of fish (tuna, salmon, and white fish) with a spicy garlic sauce.\u000a\u000aDuring dinner, two complimentary dishes were made for me.  One was a sizzling skillet of King Oyster mushrooms and one oyster shooter with hot sauce.  Finally, I had ginger ice cream for dessert at no extra cost.\u000a\u000aThe sushi chefs were really good and very pleasant guys.  The two kinds of sushi I ordered were prepared very well, and the complimentary food was delicious.  I don't think I've had such tasty mushrooms slices.\u000a\u000aI am sure I'll be back here, and I want to go with a few people when we can order more rolls and I can try different things.

VThis was my first time to the Eureka and I'll be back to eat at Fat Choy but I won't be sitting and playing any of the machines.  The smoke in the casino is heavy and you just need to walk through it to get to Fat Choy.\u000a\u000aIt's a locals kind of joint and I wonder how it continues to operate.  There's not much to recommend this place except the convenient parking in the back.\u000a\u000aPut up some doors and close off Fat Choy from the smoke--please!

VThis was one of two options given to me to get the shingles vaccination and I came here.  It was like a visit to DMV without the wait.  I was there for about 45 minutes.  \u000a\u000aThe process for vaccinations requires you to go down a hall, fill out some paperwork and get a number, and then go to the window when your number comes up.  The person at that window will look at your paperwork and notify you of what you need to pay.  Then, walk to the entrance, pay the cashier and return to the same window.  Then you have a seat and wait until one of the practitioners to call your name.  \u000a\u000aThe process is easy if you follow directions.  There was a bit of crying from some of the kids there for various reasons.  It was a good people watching place and Angry Birds helps with any wait time.

VThis review is for the gas filling area in the southwest corner of the Costco.  I've never been on the property before, but when I came from an appointment yesterday, I decided to stop and get gas as there were no lines at all.  This would never be the case in the middle of the day in Summerlin.\u000a\u000aI drove in and pulled up to one of the pumps without any line.  The pumps are newer than the Summerlin Costco but the layout is much the same.  I was on my way in just a few minutes and it proved to be very convenient.\u000a\u000aConsidering the fact that I'm at the Smith Center so much and which is 1/2 mile away, when I need a quick gas stop, I'll be looking to this Costco more often in the future.  I am a fan for sure!!

VI had foot surgery to have pins inserted to repair a broken 5th metatarsal.  I have nothing but good things to say about the LV Surgery Center.  I was registered right after I arrived.  I didn't even been to take a seat and be called but rather sat down right at the registration desk right after arriving.\u000a\u000aRegistration was quick, and I sat for about 10 minutes before an employee came to give me a few more papers to initial and sign and then I was taken inside.  My phone and insurance cards and license were secured for me.\u000a\u000aMy surgeon had arrived early and he came to see me as they were hooking up the IV and getting ready to take me to the surgical suite.  After the vitals were done, I went to the surgical suite and before long, I was in dreamland.  I woke up in recovery.\u000a\u000aEveryone from the Center with whom I was in contact were polite, personable, and professional.  Friends drove me to the Center and brought me home and I was out of my house all of about 3 hours.  Not bad.\u000a\u000aKudos to the people at the LV Surgery Center.

VThis was my second time having breakfast at the Sunshine Cafe.  Most of our hiking group decided to have a gathering this morning and enjoy breakfast together.\u000a\u000aI really like this place.  People have described it as homey or retro--both good adjectives.  The service is just about the best you could have--pleasant, efficient, and friendly.  Our server today was Wendy and she was back several times to make sure our coffee cups were always filled.\u000a\u000aI got the Texas chili omelette.  You get a really nice amount of chili on the omelette.  I had a choice of the kind of cheese I wanted in the omelette and I went with cheddar.  The breakfast comes with home fries or hash browns and choice of toast.\u000a\u000aWe had nine people at breakfast and our wait time from ordering was short.  The group was pleased with the food and the service.\u000a\u000aI'll be back.

VThanks to Candace C's original review and Charyll R's recent information that Bon was now available at the Farmer's Market in Bruce Trent Park, I went this afternoon and bought two batards--a multi-grain with cranberry and a white chocolate one. \u000a\u000aI had two small slices of the multi-grain with dinner tonight and it is superb!  I will have to ration myself carefully with this bakery delight.  This is the kind of bread that if you got it in a basket in a restaurant, you'd say, "Wow!  This is really good!  I wish I could buy this."  Now I can and so can you!\u000a\u000aThis really is artisan bread!  No wonder they deliver to the best restaurants in Las Vegas and other than a couple of farmer's markets, the goods are not available to the public.  Go and give Bon a try!

VA friend and I stopped here for breakfast prior to a hike at Red Rock Canyon.  I'm glad this was a place we decided to try.  \u000a\u000aI ordered a small portion of coconut pancakes and my friend ordered a Dutch baby.  My breakfast consisted of 3 pancakes, medium size, and some butter, maple syrup, and tropical fruit syrup.  The pancakes were already dusted with confectioners sugar so I just used a small amount of the tropical fruit syrup.  It was very good and so were the pancakes.\u000a\u000aMy friend liked his Dutch baby.  He also had two eggs and they were done nicely.\u000a\u000aService was very good.  The server came around a couple of times to give us more coffee or freshen what we had.  She was a very pleasant person besides being very competent.  This is a will  return breakfast place.  Oh, and the hike was just over 6 miles and we survived thanks partially to the good breakfast with which we started!

VWe met friends for dinner tonight at Willy & Jose's.  Our server was a very friendly person with a fine sense of humor.  Two of us ordered a trio of proteins--shrimp, chicken, and beef.  My friend doesn't eat shrimp, so it was put in a bowl on the side with extra sauce and I had double shrimp.  Her husband had beef tacos, and my wife had a chicken dish--the name escapes me.\u000a\u000aWe all enjoyed our entrees.  Very tasty sauces, good portions without being huge, and just the right amount of seasonings.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, each couple shared an order of chocolate tacos.  The taco shell was a bit rubbery and was filled with vanilla ice cream.  We made the mistake of not picking it up and eating it like an ice cream sandwich when it was cold and still somewhat frozen.  We were given small spoons when we needed a knife to slice through the bottom of the taco.  Still, it was tasty if a bit challenging to eat.\u000a\u000aI'll return to Willy & Jose's.

VI like Trader Joe's, but this is not my favorite location.  It seems like the merchandise is poorly shelved here compared to the one where I normally shop.  \u000a\u000aI tried to get some Atkins bars here today, and there was an empty box among the bars, and the bars on the shelf were not the ones from the empty box which happened to be the kind I wanted.  Next time, I'll go to the TJ I like better.\u000a\u000aStill, many great items to be had here.

VWhat do you do after a four mile hike?  Try a new place for lunch with your hiking mates.  This is what landed us at Bob Taylor's Ranch House late this morning.\u000a\u000aTwo of us had the chicken wrap which in this case is fried chicken in a tortilla with lettuce, tomato, and ranch dressing.  It was very good!  The only change I'd make would be to use regular grilled chicken, not fried, but the fried did give the wrap a nice crunch.  It was served with steak fries.  The third person in our group had the tuna melt, also served with fries.  She was very pleased with her sandwich.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, we splurged.  We had passed on an appetizer to go for the good stuff at the end.  We opted for a slice of carrot cake (it's huge!) with a scoop of ice cream.  The cake was excellent and it was the perfect sweet tooth ending to our lunch.\u000a\u000aService was terrific--perhaps because we were the only people in the restaurant.  I have a feeling that our server would have been almost as attentive if there had been 5 tables occupied.  The lunch prices are very reasonable.\u000a\u000aAfter all the years of seeing the signs for this place or seeing ads, I'm glad we gave it a try.  I have a feeling that when we hike Mount Charleston and add lunch to our rigors, we'll stop here again!

VReview is for casino and slot club only:\u000a\u000aI went to the Santa Fe to join friends for dinner.  The property is quite nice.  As it expanded, it tended to spread out, but there are different parking areas that make access to one section or another quite easy.\u000a\u000aI stopped at the slot club to buy a ticket for a show at Green Valley Ranch in March.  It was a long process, but eventually I had my ticket, and I went off to meet my friends.  This is not my first choice for playing video poker but the place is OK.

VThis has to be one of the best Starbucks in the area.  There is a lot of seating outdoors when the temperature warrants.  The indoor seating area is a bit larger than most, bit it's the outside patio area where this Starbucks shines.\u000a\u000aThe staff here has always been very good.  The quantity of food on hand is ample to meet their high demand. \u000a\u000aIt's a pleasure to come here.\u000a\u000aThere is no drive through.

VI needed to make a quick stop to buy some fresh fruit and since I was at this shopping center for a Starbuck's, I went to Vons to get the fruit.\u000a\u000aThe selection was good, I was able to check out quickly, and I was on my way.  The only slow down was the cashier trying to "hook" me on their new gas rewards like Smith's.  I took the brochure and thanked her for her information.\u000a\u000aThis isn't my normal store and it's several miles from home, so it won't be my shopping place.  I will stop in here when I'm in the neighborhood to pick up some items.

VI have been to several of Nevada Ballet Theatre's programs at UNLV, but this was my first NBT Studio show.  \u000a\u000aTonight's program was called "Beyond Word and Text" and featured 5 works choreographed by members of the company.  During the 5 dances, these young people showed their amazing talent whether through the choreography or the dancing.\u000a\u000aThe Studio Theatre is an intimate room.  These shows will now go to CLark County Schools as part of the arts in schools program.  The next studio series will be at the Smith Center in the Spring of 2012 when NBT moves to the Smith Center for the Performing Arts.

VI can only speak as a visitor.  A friend was in critical condition when he was transported there.  After much surgery and many days of critical care, he was brought out of his induced coma.  He is now in a rehab facility not associated with Summerlin Hospital.\u000a\u000aThe hospital staff appeared friendly, concerned, and competent.

V*** This review is for the Desert Spring Theatre Arts at Desert Spring Methodist Church ***\u000a\u000aI went to see Bye, Bye Birdie yesterday at the church.  I was asked if I'd judge the 6 productions the company is doing during the 2013 season that began with Birdie.  \u000a\u000aFirst, the venue is quite nice for doing a theatre piece, but it does have some drawbacks.  The scenery changes had to be done very carefully as there are three steps that go to the floor.  The youngsters and adults who were changing the scenery did so with flashlights so they could avoid a fall--quite understandable but something you don't see with most theatres.\u000a\u000aThe sound in the church was very good.  With some other theatres in Las Vegas, the person in the sound booth didn't turn on microphones quickly enough and some of the first words were not heard as well because the mic was not yet live. \u000a\u000aGiven the nature of the "stage the actors did a fine job in moving in and around set pieces.  At times, there were quite a few performers on stage which made the going a little difficult but they pulled it off well.\u000a\u000aI look forward to attending the rest of their season.  The church is only 2 miles from my home and it's a pleasure to see the kids do such fine work.  Oh, the adults did a nice job also!

VI took several reels of 16mm movie film to Patchin to have them put the files onto a DVD.  Understand, most of the film is 60 years or more old.  The film was very brittle and the last time I tried to view them on a movie projector, the lead of the film would break off and it just wouldn't work.  When I first moved to Las Vegas, I called a few companies and asked about doing this.  They responded with, "Sorry, we can't handle 16mm film."\u000a\u000aI had gotten a recommendation from a guy who hikes with our group.  He was very pleased with the slide to DVD transfer they did for him.  I called Pathcin to see if they did 16mm films and the answer was yes.  I was off to their place with high hopes.\u000a\u000aI was told that it might take a month before the transfer was done because they do 16mm when they have a couple to do because of the set up required.  He also said it might be only a week--it depended on their business.\u000a\u000aI got a call today, less than two weeks after I dropped off the reels, and I now have a DVD with movies from when I was 5 or 6 years old and behaved like a hyperactive, little terror.  I have 55 minutes of priceless memories thanks to their fine work!\u000a\u000aI will be able to share these memories with my brother--something we both had hoped to do years ago. \u000a\u000aPatchin was great!  Very personable and very professional product!

VWhat is it with women and purses--well my wife anyway.  I finally bit the bullet and said I'd take her to Burlington today--no Coach for her.  Burlington usually has something that will fill the bill, but there's a lot of looking and looking and well you get it.  Today atypical.  Within 20 minutes, she found the perfect purse--for this year anyway. \u000a\u000aAs usual, things in Burlington were messy.  Things were all over the place.  I guess there are so many people rummaging through that they just don't have nor take the time to replace stock the way a normal outlet would.\u000a\u000aThen came checkout.  It's akin to enhanced interrogation.  You wonder if you're in the correct lane.  You bob and weave to move to another lane that then stops moving.  It's a nightmare.\u000a\u000aI really would like to give the place more than 2 stars but any visit to Burlington is not OK in my book.

VThis was the first Wells Fargo bank at which I did business when I moved to Nevada.  At that time, it was the branch most west and was the most convenient.  That's no longer the case and I rarely go here.\u000a\u000aThis is an OK place to stop to use the ATM, but depending on your direction, it can be a bit dicey getting back on your way.  Sahara and Rainbow is a busy intersection.\u000a\u000aI can't really say what it's like to go inside anymore because I haven't done that.  This branch merits an OK and nothing more.

VI have been to the Polish Deli twice and I got the same thing twice.  It's a Friday in Lent and my wife observes meatless Fridays.  What to make.  I was coming from Big 5 Sporting Goods and when I saw the Polish Deli, I got over to the right lane and turned in here.\u000a\u000aA quick perusal of the freezer case and I found the pierogis.  I chose the potato cheese because I'm not fond of the other flavors.  I have never had one of the fruit flavored ones, but I'm sure they'd be OK for dessert especially deep fried.\u000a\u000aThere is a nice selection of Polish sausages on the counter behind.  I need to stop back and get some of their kielbasa.  It looks so much better than the stuff you see in grocery stores.\u000a\u000aService was pleasant and quick.  The shop is small and questions are answered very politely.\u000a\u000aAs a side note, this brand of pierogi, Alexandra's, was quite good.  Some fried onions in lots of butter and the pierogis baked for awhile, made a great meal.  I need to stop in here more often.

VI had some time to spend between shows tonight, so I made the short jaunt to this Baskin-Robbins to have something cool with our summer weather starting.  I haven't been to a BR for years so I had to study the board to see what to order.\u000a\u000aI decided on the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough 31° Below soft serve.  Wow!  Was it tasty!  Next time, I will get a smaller size.  It's very rich and very filled with all those cookie dough pieces and tons of calories.  But. it was worth it on this warm night!

VI drive by this location often going to and from plays at Las Vegas Little Theatre in Chinatown.  I always see their Blizzard of the Month and I have never had one.  I'm always on my way home and it's on the wrong side of Spring Mountain Road.\u000a\u000aOK, I had extra time the other night and I had a strong desire to get some ice cream on the 100 degree day.  Problem solved.  Traffic was lighter than normal and I was able to make the south turn into the DQ , parked, and went inside.\u000a\u000aThe store is a bit old and somewhat rundown, but it was clean and there weren't many people there.  I looked at the Blizzard board for quite awhile and decided to go with the Blizzard of the Month--Confetti cake.  That's white cake pieces and confetti frosting blended with vanilla soft serve.  It was OK.  I should have stood firm with something peanut butter, but hey, when you're Blizzard of the Month, I guess you have to be good.\u000a\u000aI may stop here again but I'll order with more care.  The staff was very pleasant and let me take all the time I wanted to decide.  Good service.

VOur hiking group stopped here for dim sum to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival a bit early.  There were seven of us, and we were seated at a large table by the large glass windows.\u000a\u000aService was excellent.  Since one of the group is a native Taiwanese, she does the selecting and ordering.  We had an array of food - shrimp dumplings, duck on peanuts, a noodle dish, meatballs, excellent fried shrimp, a tasty vegetable dish, pork buns, and some excellent sesame balls with different fillings.\u000a\u000aWe have made it a tradition to come here twice a year (at least) to have this lunch, and we have always been pleased.  I look forward to it each time.\u000a\u000aPS:  I think there was a fellow Yelper at the restaurant.  IF you read this review, I apologize for my uncertainty and not recognizing you.

VThis is my Wally World.  Now that the renovation is complete, things are back to normal.  I would give them 5 stars, but they are so bad about their inventory.  If an item sells out, it may take weeks before they get it back.  Also, why do some Wallys sell different items?  I can't get Ken's Blue Cheese dressing here, but I can in almost every other Wally World.  Go figure!

VI have only made one stop here, and that was to buy some bagels.  I had a sesame bagel this morning and it was OK.  Service was quick and the person who took my order was very pleasant and courteous.\u000a\u000aMy only complaint about the place is the same for any storefront in this area.  The parking can be a bear.

VI have mixed feelings about Lake Las Vegas.  One the one hand, I hate the fact that we allowed the diversion of water from Lake Mead to create this artificial lake for an upscale resort, shopping, and housing area.  On the other hand, isn't the whole valley built on Lake Mead diverted water?\u000a\u000aThe Great Recession has hit as hard here as it has anywhere in the Las Vegas Valley.  Many of the stores are empty and available for lease.  The best thing about Lake Las Vegas are the large number of special events they have to drive traffic to the resort.  \u000a\u000aIf you ever saw the Andrea Bocelli concert: Amore Under the Desert Sky, then you've seen Lake Las Vegas.  Bocelli performed from a stage for special events that's in the Lake Las Vegas Village near the Ravella Hotel, then the Ritz Carlton.\u000a\u000aThe resort is fine but mostly for special events.  It's not worth the drive for me unless there's a destination reason.

VThis was my first time to Casino Monte Lago since it reopened.  It's pretty much like it used to be, but I think they have fewer machines and the middle area seems more open than it used to be.\u000a\u000aIt's a pleasant casino, small, and fairly quiet albeit I was there on a Saturday morning for the Dragon Boat races.\u000a\u000aSince it's on the far side of the valley from where I live, this won't be a stop I'll be making very often.  There are other good choices much closer to home.

VReview for casino only:\u000a\u000aI've been to the Fiesta Henderson many times, mostly before there were other Station casinos of better quality and nearer to home.  I like their coffee shop and the Mexican place was very good.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, now I use the Fiesta as a place to meet up with friends when we go hiking.  You don't know how easy it is to just say, "Meet me under the big Fiesta sign out front."  No one misses that!  Well, there was the time that a friend went to the Fiesta Rancho and totally missed the sign.\u000a\u000aI stopped here Monday to meet hiking friends and I went in to use the bathroom before leaving on our great hike.\u000a\u000aOne of these days, I'll return to the Fiesta for some food and play and give this place the better review it deserves.

VI attend performances by the Rainbow Company Youth Theatre.  The Center has two theatres, the intimate 80 seat Studio Theatre on the north side of the building, and a 275 seat main theatre on the west side of the building beyond the office of the Neon Museum.\u000a\u000aLast night., I saw the Rainbow Company's "The Zombies Walk Among Us" mostly performed by kids doing a fine job of acting and having fun.  Ity was the first time I've been in the Main Theatre, and it's quite a good performance space.  The rest of the shows for the Rainbow Theatre performed this year at Reed Whipple will be in the Studio Theatre.\u000a\u000aThe art work and historic photos of Las Vegas makes the Reed Whipple a great place.

VThe thing I like most of McCarran is when I arrive back home and see the large display screens and I hear the ads for the shows on the Strip.  I know I'm home.\u000a\u000aMcCarran operates relatively efficiently, but sometimes the baggage wait seems interminable.  Tonight I waited and waited for my wife's suitcase to show itself on Carousel 16.  No suitcase,  I went to report it, and there was the case.  Her first leg got into Philadelphia so early, it was sent on an earlier flight.  It has been sitting there all that time.  I wish I knew that.\u000a\u000aOne of the great things about McCarran is the Cannon Air Museum on the second floor above baggage claim.  There are some wonderful photos and objects of early Las Vegas airports and airlines, and it's quite interesting.\u000a\u000aFinally, where else do you arrive/depart to the site of slot machines!  Enough said!

VI bought 6 bagels.  The counter staff was efficient and friendly.  I was in and out in about 1 minute.  This store is a bit smaller than other Einstein Brothers around town and the selection seemed to be a bit less.  Nevertheless, they had what I wanted.  \u000a\u000aI wish Einstein would bring back plain salt bagels.  I'd rather have plain salt than their pretzel bagel, but they're still good.

VCasino only review:\u000a\u000aI needed to waste some time between shows last night, so I stopped at Binion's for a little video poker.  It was a successful effort as I didn't lose my shirt nor anything else.\u000a\u000aWhile the place could certainly use some upgrading, I find that Binion's is more than just an OK place.  Cocktail service has always been fast.  I also have learned where to play so that I have a ringside seat to watch the sexy cowgirls--the dealers that Lily D talks about in her review.  The dealers wear skimpy cowgirl uniforms that give some serious views.\u000aSometimes it's hard to concentrate on VP when you're eyeing the dealers going by.  They are attractive thangs!\u000a\u000aBecause of the good eye candy at Binions, it gets an extra star to bring it to 4 stars.  The ladies have earned it!

VGo to a tamale restaurant and not get tamals?  Well, the plan was to try a red and green tamal but that ended when I saw the special for the day - shrimp ceviche tostadas.  There were two to the order.\u000a\u000aThe citrus used to create the ceviche was excellent.  It was tangy and gave the shrimp a good flavor.  The pieces of shrimp were small in size.  The tostadas came with two lemon sections for extra citrus flavor.  The waiter also brought a bottle of Tapatío without asking.  Great!\u000a\u000aService was very good if not too good.  I was going to get something for dessert but when he noticed I was finished, he brought the bill over and said, "No hurry.  I'll take that when you're ready."  OK!  So I was off to the Mirage for a show and I stopped in my neighborhood for a Baskin-Robbins.  Their loss.\u000a\u000aI am going to try the Dona Maria's on Cheyenne nearer home and I will get some tamals.

I counted 14 tables - 6 booths each seating up to 4, 7 tables each seating up to 4, and one table seating 2.  \u000a\u000aI had the pork chili verde with beans and rice and corn tortillas.  Standard chips and salsa--the salsa having some great zing to it!  The chili verde was good.  I used a fair amount of Tapatio to give the cili verde some zest.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I had some flan which was a great custard with caramel sauce that was quite tasty.\u000a\u000aThis place was OK, but it wouldn't be my first go to place when I wanted some Mexican food.

VI came here today to have breakfast at Du-Pars.  It has been years since I've been in this small joint (fondly stated)!  There is so much history on the walls with the photographs of San Francisco.  But, what I really liked were the local mementos--a replica of an original 1907 Kellogg telephone that was in the Golden Gate when it was the Hotel Nevada and had the telephone number of 1.  Near the replica phone is an original guest book for the hotel dated 1906-1908.  What a wonderful piece of history!  There are some photos also of more modern interest.  Check the south wall as you head toward Du-Pars from the table games area and see the photo of  Marg Helgenberger when she was on Fremont Street filming CSI.\u000a\u000aI have to go back and take some more time to see the photos and enjoy the history of the place.  I also need to try their shrimp cocktail just because!

This was a quick stop involving one U-turn, but it was OK.\u000a\u000aThe store was very clean and well lit. They have a whole bunch of souvenirs for the city so this would be a good stop for those who are in this part of town and want to get some inexpensive t-shirts or shot glasses.

VReview for casino only:\u000a\u000aLike most downtown places, the casino is small, crowded with machines, generally noisy, and filled with tourists in various states of alcohol influence.  That being said, I've always found the place to be a fun spot--a place where people watching gets kicked into high gear!\u000a\u000aI came here last night to see a show and left with a silver strike and some of their cash.  It was a winning evening!\u000a\u000aI like the free parking with validation in their garage.

VReview for casino only:\u000a\u000aWe had dinner at the Flame Steakhouse last night and played some video poker before going to another destination for a show.  The El Cortez has changed a lot in the last number of years.  The place is a lot brighter and cleaner than it used to be.\u000a\u000aThe slot staff is around often to help those who need help of any kind.  The pay tables for VP are among the best in Las Vegas and downtown.  Cocktail service was often and prompt.\u000a\u000aThis is a good place to go for a change of pace.  It was nice to see the Las Vegas legend, Jackie Gaughan, playing poker at one of the tables.  He is the last of a rare breed of casino guys from days gone by,

They were coming in the day I was leaving, so I called and asked about checking their bags so they were there for them when they arrived.\u000a\u000aThe bell desk woman was very pleasant on the phone and just as pleasant in person.  They took the bags, stored them, and my friends collected them when they arrived Tuesday night.

VI had to check this place out today after watching a few episodes on the History Channel..  There's some interesting stuff.  The Iwo Jima drawings, secret drawings from World War II, are not for sale.\u000a\u000aThe parking lot had a lot of spaces available.  There were a lot of cabs there waiting for tourists who came to see their piece of TV, too.\u000a\u000aThere was no one from the show in the shop, but I did recognize some items on sale that I saw on recent shows.\u000a\u000aThe place is an amazing slice of Americana.  It's a place you shouldn't miss if you have the chance.

VI am a fan of this buffet.  It's been awhile, so when we were in the area and having a BOGO, how could we not go?\u000a\u000aI had two things specifically that I knew in advance I wanted - Kalua pork and collard greens.  Both were as good as they always are.  They also had black bean chili made with pieces of beef rather than the usual hamburger.  I had a small amount of their spicy tofu.  It was good, but it wasn't spicy.  It needed a lot more kick.  Finally, I had one wrapped laulau.  It was seasoned well, but I didn't taste any fish.  There was some ground pork but no fish. Dessert was a piece of no sugar added Key lime pie. \u000a\u000aI'll be returning even if just to have kalua pork and the collard greens.

VI write this review with mixed feelings.  I wish we didn't have to go there.  My wife is still an addicted smoker.  This the trek to this store periodically to replenish her supply.\u000a\u000aI have mot found service to be an issue.  They offer off brands at more reasonable price than the name brands.

VThis is a review of Kevin Burke's Fitz of Laughter which I went to see last night.\u000a\u000aBurke is a great entertainer!  His show is just about an hour in length in the second floor showroom at the Fitz.  He does some great jokes and the show is quite funny.  In addition, he does some mentalist-like tricks.  I know he "forces the card", but he does it in such a slick way, I just can't explain how he does it.\u000a\u000aLast night, he "borrowed" a cell phone from a young thing sitting in the front who was texting during the show.  I'm not sure if it was an arranged thing or not, but we all had a lot of fun with his texting the woman's boyfriend using her phone.\u000a\u000aI'd see this show again any day!

VReview for casino only:\u000a\u000aI haven't been to Sam's Town for about 3 years. We went today to meet some friends for dinner.  First some video poker.  \u000a\u000aThere was a fairly standard Boyd Casinos mix of games.  The casino was not overly chilled with air conditioning but was rather pleasant.\u000a\u000aWhile not a comment about the facility, I don't think I've seen so many people with walkers and canes in one place as I did at Sam's Town.  It's the nature of a locals' casino that caters to retirees.

VMy wife and I ate here over a year ago, and I was very disappointed in the meal.  I agree that for the price, I'd expect a nicer place with better service and not an entrance from the parking lot that is like a service entrance.\u000a\u000aThe food was nothing special.  It is an amalgam, and that's not what we were looking for.  We wanted good Cuban food.  Not here.  This is the one food area where Las Vegas is really lacking.

VI've been to the Old Mormon Fort before but I went back today to see the Helen Stewart statue that was dedicated last December--a dedication I couldn't make because of a conflict.\u000a\u000aIf you are interested in Las Vegas history, this is a must visit sometime as this is where the town started along the Las Vegas Creek.  After the Mormons abandoned the camp, it was first the home of O. D. Gass and then Archibald and Helen Stewart.  I have always admired Helen Stewart--she's called the First Lady of Las Vegas--so taking the time to see her statue was a must do.\u000a\u000aThere are some things to see in the small museum and you can walk around the grounds and in one of the buildings see the only piece of the original fort that survived.  A little under whelming but it's there nonetheless.\u000a\u000aAdmission is only $1 so it won't break the bank.  Go and enjoy!

VAfter reading a review in one of the alternative newspapers, I had to give this place a try.  I had the chicken/beef combo molcajetes.  It was superb!  The place is a small bungalow-like building with parking in the front and sides.  It's in a small commercial area, but it's a stand alone building.\u000a\u000aThe tables have 5 or 6 bottles of different hot sauces you can try.  It seemed like that had one waitress for Spanish speaking people and one for gabachos like me.  \u000a\u000aGive this place a try!  You won't regret I'll be back to try more soon.

VI used to have a mini-season ticket to the 51s and then it seemed to become too much of a chore going to games so often and I fell away from going.  With our Yelp event here, it was time for me to get back into the summer pastime and enjoy a ball game.\u000a\u000aThe 51s have never been strong contenders for league winners.  They have been affiliated with the Dodgers, the Blue Jays, and now the Mets.  Except for the facts that the 51s won the other night, what fascinated me the most was seeing the "bottoms up" beer machine which was right below where I was sitting.  \u000a\u000aIt was $1 beer night, so there were a number of people coming by.  I asked Jared N. and Anthony M. how the thing worked.  A short lesson later, I was watching the little magnet being pushed up as the kindly barmaids pushed the cups onto the filler.  Fantastic!  \u000a\u000aThere have been some rumors that the 51s will be re-branding and using a different name and a new theme.  The team has been sold and the new owners want to build a new stadium a block from where I live.  Gone may be the Area 51 reference in their name and the mascot, Cosmo.  Speaking of Cosmo, anyone who has to prance around in an outfit like that when the summer temperatures are in the 100s deserves to be paid well!\u000a\u000aIt's fun to go to a 51s game and I'll be back sooner than the years I've let go by without returning to Cashman Field for a game.

VOK, I had a show to go to and I needed not to nod off at any time during the performance.  What to do?  Stop at Starbucks on the way and get a quad espresso, the drink of champions.\u000a\u000aThis Rainbow Boulevard location is semi on my way and it's open later than a neighborhood Bucyky, so here it was.  The coffee was great, the play was fantastic, and it was a great night.\u000a\u000aI think I have a new stopping off spot when I need that extra lift!

VI came here for a special showing of "Driving Miss Daisy" - a one day special film.  I had been here many years ago, but with so many theatres within a few miles of home, I don't have to drive to the Orleans.\u000a\u000aThe theatre was very nice.  Everything was clean.  The elevator by the escalators made it easy for my wife to get to the second floor.\u000a\u000aThe seats were comfortable but they weren't reclining ones.  The box office woman was quite polite and efficient.\u000a\u000aI would come back if another special showing came up and it was only available at the Century Orleans 18.

VWe came here after the Thai restaurant we were planning to go to didn't open for a half hour beyond their published time.  That's what's so good about living in a city where there are hundreds of choices.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Green curry with pork--spice level 7 out of 10--and my wife got the Garlic pepper chicken.  We have to remember to tell Asian and Mexican restaurants to leave off the cilantro.  She's one of those strange creatures who doesn't like cilantro.\u000a\u000aBoth dishes were very good and the spice level of 7 was great!  Perhaps I could have pushed it higher, but this had a good zing and only a few small tears showed themselves.\u000a\u000aWe ended the meal each having a scoop of ice cream.  I had the mango and Andrea had the coconut.  Mine was very creamy and tasty and hers was, too--I finished hers.  Win- win!\u000a\u000aService was just wonderful.  A couple of people took our order, delivered food, brought iced tea refills.  It was a team effort.  That earned them the 4th star.

V*** This review is for the Shenanigans room only ***\u000a\u000aI have been to McMullan's twice for shows.  There is a rather larger room on the west side of the building that is used for plays or other performances.  Last night, I came to see "Stones in His Pockets,"  an Irish play.  \u000a\u000aThe room is just perfect for this kind of small production!  Last night, the room was set up for approximately 50 people.  There are low chairs and chairs that are bar height.  Since you're at McMullan's, there's ample room to put a beer or some Irish style nachos to enjoy while you watch the show.\u000a\u000aThe people at McMullan's have always been extremely pleasant and they welcome people to the pub more graciously.  Now, I need to go back and have an Irish pie and I'll update my review so I can judge the food.

VI can now update my review for McMullan's because we came here for dinner last night before going to a show at the Las Vegas Little Theatre.  While I am not knowledgeable about Irish pubs, McMullan's earns all 5 stars--it was as good as it gets!\u000a\u000aI asked our server, Jessica, if we could sit out of the bar area in the small room that is to the right after you enter.  Once our eyes adjusted to the dim lighting, it turned out to be the right choice.  It's a delightful room and just a bit away from the music and the talking in the bar area.\u000a\u000aI had studied the menu online before we went, and I knew what I was getting, the Irish chicken curry pie.  Andrea surprised me by wanting the steak and mushroom pie so it was Irish pies for both of us.  We knew in advance that it would be at least a 25 minute wait and we just chatted and I took some photos and explained what was behind the door to the Shenanigans room.\u000a\u000aOur pies were brought to us and they were delicious.  I loved the curry taste of my chicken and there was some zing to the curry.  It was much different than the flavors of Indian or Thai curry.  The pastry was very flaky and stayed that way all the time I was eating.  Andrea enjoyed her pie, too.  With both dinners came a large amount of mashed potatoes and a good serving of peas.  All the time, our iced teas were refilled and Jessica checked back often to see how we were doing. \u000a\u000aOf course, a dinner out is not complete without the sweet so we ordered sticky toffee pudding for dessert and shared it.  We got it with vanilla ice cream which was put in a separate glass goblet so the heated pudding didn't melt the ice cream.  A winning dish!\u000a\u000aDuring our time here, Mr. McMullan came to the table twice.  He remembered me from the shows I was there to see and he wanted to say hello.  Later he checked to make sure everything was OK with our dinner.\u000a\u000aThe personal touch of Mr. McMullan, the delightfully friendly server Jessica, and the outstanding food all made the evening a 5 star experience.  And what could be better than this--seeing two Yelp friends and somewhat neighbors, who were there having dinner too!  Hey Candace. and August.  Good to see you again!\u000a\u000aWe will be coming back to try more of the things on their extensive menu!

VI met a friend for lunch at Pasta Mia today and I thought lunch was OK.  The server did not tell us of any specials.  We ordered from the menu.  I got the chicken marsala and my friend got chicken parmigiana.  We received a nice basket of garlic bread - much more than is needed for two people.  It was good.  Part of the bread was crunchy and part was soft.  You could take your choice.\u000a\u000aBoth lunches came with choice of soup or salad.  We each got the salad which came with a creamy Italian.  It was good.  Each lunch came with rigatoni with red sauce.  The sauce was good--nothing exceptional but there was certainly nothing wrong with it.  We passed on getting any dessert.  What was served was more than enough for lunch.  My iced tea was refilled without asking and my friend's water glass was refilled.\u000a\u000aLunch was $10.99 each and they took the coupon from their menu page (buy one entrée and get half off a second entrée).  \u000a\u000aService was prompt and attentive throughout.  It should have been because we went there at 1 PM after their busiest lunch time.  Altogether, an OK place and a pleasant lunch with someone I haven't seen in about 5 years.

VI had a special cat scratching post to buy that only Petco carries or I wouldn't have come here.  I give the store three stars simply because they had what I wanted.  Other than that, the place is small and the selection of most items is limited.\u000a\u000aWhile here, I bought a new hummingbird feeder.  They only stock two kinds.  The one I took was discounted because the top was lost.  Since I don't hang my feeder (Las Vegas winds always knock them off the tree and to the ground) this was perfectly OK.\u000a\u000aThis is a place to go when I need that special something for the cats that I can't get elsewhere.  They have their hearts set on the 63 inch cat tube.  I got that disappointed look from them when it didn't come out of the bag I brought home.  Oh well, a trip back.

VThanks to a friend's recommendation, I went to the Polaris Street Cafe for breakfast this morning.  Never judge a book by its cover!  From the outside you think, "This is the place Ben recommended?"  Once inside, it's a totally different world.  Red and white checked tablecloths on the tables, movie posters, and photos of old actors and actresses on the walls, and a very friendly staff.\u000a\u000aI took a seat and a server brought me a menu and asked about something to drink.  I ordered coffee and he brought me both coffee and a glass of ice water.  The coffee was promptly refilled while I was there.\u000a\u000aI had seen the menu online and I knew they had a good breakfast selection.  I ordered the Ranchero omelette which is a 3 egg omelette with pieces of sausage, green chilies, avocado,  cheddar cheese, and topped with a ranchero sauce.  It comes with fried potatoes and toast or biscuit.  In my case, I ordered rye toast and they asked if I wanted it buttered or not.\u000a\u000aWhile waiting, I was surprised by the number of calls they got for delivery.  It seemed like someone was always on the phone taking an order.  In a short time, a server brought my breakfast and asked if I wanted any hot sauce.  Cholula, of course.  I was all set.\u000a\u000aThe breakfast was excellent.  Hearty and really more than I should have eaten even letting the plates go with some of the toast and potatoes unfinished.  \u000a\u000aThe restaurant has three rooms.  Two larger rooms and one small room off to the north of the building.  \u000a\u000aThis is a warehouse, business section of town so there are bars over the windows and on the door.  Don't be fooled by the cover.  The book is great!  Thanks Ben!  I owe you.  Maybe breakfast at the Polaris?

VI had a Groupon for Bonito Michoacan.  I was seated in the bar area and the bartender was my server.  She brought me chips, salsa, and bean dip quickly along with my iced tea.  She passed the empty sweetener bag test with flying colors!\u000a\u000aFirst. my dinner came with fideo soup.  It was very good with less of a tomato taste than I'm used to getting.  There was more of a chicken stock flavor.  For the main course, I ordered the Enchiladas de Mole con Pollo, two cheese enchiladas heated in a red mole sauce with a chicken breast, refried beans, rice, and some lettuce shreds and a dollop of sour cream.  The mole tasted a bit sweet at first but then I got the undertones of the other spices and the richness of the mole came out.  The chicken breast was good.  It was seasoned in any manner so I gave it a good shower of Tapatio.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I got the fried ice cream.  I guess fried ice cream is just something that comes out of the freezer.  I don't think anyone "breads" and fries the ice cream in real time anymore.\u000a\u000aI was very pleased with my visit.  I was of two minds about where I was seated.  Two men were having a loud discussion (argument?) about politics in Spanish and the one had enough tecate to not know how loudly he was talking.  However, I could have been sitting in another part of the restaurant where there was a crying baby.  I think it was better where I was.  \u000a\u000aThis was an enjoyable dinner!

VI needed to stop at an ATM last night and this location was on my way.  There's not a whole lot I can say about the experience except it was quick.  There was  no one there and I drove right up to the machine and was on my way quickly.\u000a\u000aThe only thing that threw me was the fact that their ATM is opposite almost every other Wells Fargo.  Instead of being on the outside lane, the ATM is the one against the wall as you drive in.  Strange.

VI am a season subscriber - going on four years - and I enjoy much of what they do.  Of course, not all plays are written, directed, or acted well, but LVLT does an excellent job.  \u000a\u000aThe mainstage theatre has about 100 seats while the Fischer Blackbox is usually set up for around 45 people.  Blackbox productions tend to be edgier in nature, sometimes doing controversial subjects.\u000a\u000aThis year, LVLT had their first annual Fringe Festival.  There were 9 plays performed four times over two weekends.  None of the plays was longer than an hour, and the entire fringe was superb!\u000a\u000aGo see something at Las Vegas Little Theatre.  It's inexpensive and very entertaining!

VI met friends from out of town for lunch earlier this week.  As always, Nora's did not disappoint!  There were 5 of us and we ordered a large salad that was enough to serve everyone at the table with seconds.  Ands, it was very good!\u000a\u000aI ordered one of their menu's "Lunch Favorites."  It was the penne chicken broccoli pasta with garlic and oil.  It was excellent.  One minus--there wasn't enough garlic taste for me.  One of the others at the table ordered a large pizza with pineapple and mushrooms--the pineapple being a first for me.  It was such a pity when there were three pieces of pizza left over and she couldn't take it home with her.  She was winging back to Canada the next morning.  I made the sacrifice and took one for the team.  I brought the three pieces home, had one for dinner, and have the other two frozen for a lunch treat!  Tip to Yelpers---go out to eat with out of town friends the day before they're flying home and you might get some take out for the rest of the week.\u000a\u000aI have been a fan of Nora's for several years and I highly recommend the place to anyone looking for good Italian food with a really good atmosphere and great service!

VReview for casino only:\u000a\u000aThe Gold Coast is a pleasant casino with a good selection of VP and denominations.  Parking is quite convenient with either garage.  I normally park in the Flamingo garage and it's a quick walk into the casino.\u000a\u000aBeverage service is generally prompt and any interactions I've had with floor people has always been great.

VI have been here once for breakfast two years ago and tonight decided to stop in for dinner before our show.  We each had the stuffed chicken breast from the smaller portions section of their menu.  It was a chicken breast stuffed with broccoli.  The broccoli and the chicken had a cheese sauce that was quite tasty.  I had a small salad (choice of soup or salad), the chicken, mashed potatoes, and grilled yellow and green squash rounds.\u000a\u000aDinner was quite good.  The service was outstanding!  Our server was very polite, friendly, and competent.  Even being from the smaller portions offerings, it was a lot to eat.\u000a\u000aI like the ambiance of the place with all things bear - even the bear paw print on the napkins.  I wonder if anyone has ever counted the number of bears - stuffed or otherwise - that decorate almost every free space of the restaurant.\u000a\u000aI'll be back!\u000a\u000aYelpers - mention Yelp and you get soda, coffee, or tea complimentary.  One per table.

VThis is a review for the casino only:\u000a\u000aI like the fact that the Rio has decided to mix their VP lineup with some different machines.  I am generally not fond of the 'bevertainers' and I find it distracting--well sometimes it is.  It just depends if you know what I mean.\u000a\u000aThis is a casino I rarely play at unless I'm there for a show or to meet friends.  It tends to be loud, especially in the evenings, and the clientele is of a younger age.  Lots of drinking, yelling, high fiving and all the other things the youngsters do.

VI went to Alizé for their Valentine's menu (only one choice last night) and I enjoyed my experience.  First, one cannot write a review without mentioning the extraordinary view.  It is amazing!  I was seated at 5:30 when they opened, and it was just getting dusk and I watched the lights come on as the Strip came to its night brightness.  On to the food.\u000a\u000aI started with an amuse-bouche of caramelized onion and white truffle panna cotta with apricot confiture and green onion.  The panna cotta didn't strike me as being something special but the apricot confiture was superb!  The amuse-bouche did the job though with a good start.\u000a\u000aFor the first course, I chose Andrés foie gras terrine with port poached figs, toasted brioche, and cinnamon pear preserve.  This was good.  The foie gras was as I expected but once again, the fruit took center stage.  The poached fig was amazing!\u000a\u000aFor course 2, I chose the crispy lobster and St. André cheese croustillant with grapefruit emulsion and minced chives.  There was a seafood taste to the croustillant, but I wouldn't have guessed lobster.  The St. André came through nicely.  I've eaten enough St. André to recognize the flavor and it was good.  The grapefruit emulsion was excellent.  Again the fruit shines brightly.  The croustillant was served with mixed greens with a cucumber and balsamic vinaigrette.  The menu said served with or without herbed goat cheese but I was unaware of anyone near me being given a choice.  There was no goat cheese.\u000a\u000aThen a palate cleanser of passion fruit sorbet.  The menu said it was to be lemon kiwi sorbet, but it didn't matter.  The passion fruit was perfect.\u000a\u000aFor course 3 I chose the pan roasted veal loin with rosemary and bacon polenta, haricot verts, and mixed mushrooms.  The veal was very tasty and very tender.  The haricot verts were in a small bunch that was tied with a green onion tie.  The presentation was super.  I thought the sauce was OK.  I expected it to be richer, but the menu said veal jus and that's about what it was.  The bacon polenta was the star of this dish.\u000a\u000aLast course, dessert, was a trio of small desserts.  In the middle of the plate was a large strawberry, a shortbread cookie in the shape of a heart, and some chocolate fondue in a cup with a heart shaped piece of white chocolate on top.  To the right, the compartment held a Meyer lemon biscuit with a blackberry sauce and poppy seed gaufrette.  There was also one fresh blackberry.  Finally, the left compartment had a white chocolate and macadamia torte with caramelized florentine.  There were two standouts in the trio of desserts.  The chocolate fondue was ridiculously wonderful and rich.  The other star was the white chocolate and macadamia torte.\u000a\u000aService was superb!  There were a number of servers and bus people for each table.  Dishes were briefly explained when they were brought, and refills of iced tea were never asked for--just delivered.  \u000a\u000aI was surprised that they added 18% gratuity to everyone's check.  The menu stated that so it was no surprise.  The check says (18% - Lrg party 18) and my waiter pointed it out to me when he left the check.  I guess he got a bit screwed as I would tip 20% for service as good as this, but since they were insisting, he got the 18% with no additional, albeit I could have added more on.  Didn't they trust people to tip reasonably on Valentine's Day?\u000a\u000aI might come back to bring my wife for dinner.  The price is not justified by the food, but the view is certainly worth a lot.

VWhat do you do to impress your wife on your anniversary?  Take her to Alizé.\u000a\u000aI was concerned we'd be too early to see the lights come on as the sun set.  It got dark quickly and we enjoyed the view in both daylight and after dark.  We were seated promptly and as was the case when I ate here before, service was excellent.  We were soon brought two iced teas and then we ordered.\u000a\u000aWe were brought an amuse-bouche of crab in panna cotta on one side and a small piece of foie gras on the other.  One of the runners soon came with a selection of three breads--lavash, regular baguette, and a gluten free roll.  We each took some lavash and the roll.  The roll had great flavor.\u000a\u000aFor the first course, I got the smoked salmon with fried egg and Andrea got the Roasted mushroom Toban-Yaki with miso-mushroom broth.  The plating on my appetizer was just a delight and it was so flavorful!  Andrea enjoyed her toban-yaki and I got a chance to try some of the mushrooms.  Great flavor.\u000a\u000aFor our main courses, I got the beef rib eye and Andrea got the chicken breast with sausage stuffing and chestnuts.  Both were very good.  I finished a small amount of her chicken and I can attest to how good it was.  My beef was perfect.\u000a\u000aDessert--I chose the chocolate soufflé and Andrea got the warm peach galette with almond marzipan ice cream.  Two more winners!  \u000a\u000aAfter dessert, a runner came with a trolley on which were placed several mignardises from which to choose.  We got two each and it was a pleasant ending to the meal.\u000a\u000aI got coffee with dessert and it was strong and flavorful!\u000a\u000aLet me say again how good service was!  Silvano and his crew were on their game during our stay there.  The staff was polite, friendly, and very accommodating.  It was a wonderful dinner with a great view in one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.

VI've been to several shows at the Arts Center.  The theatre is a fairly large performance area with seating for several hundred people.\u000a\u000aThis is the new home for all productions of the Rainbow Theatre Company since the building they were using on Las Vegas Boulevard was being closed and then taken over by another company.\u000a\u000aThere are rotating art exhibits here.  Parking is available in the lot and on street.  Last night's production of Charlotte's Web was very well done!  The kids do a great job!

VThis review is for the new Nevada State Museum, not the one at Lorenzi Park but the new building at the Springs Preserve.  There was a members only preview today, and the new museum is grand!\u000a\u000aThere are two main exhibit halls, one housing the permanent displays and one with rotating exhibits.  There is so much more room for the things the museum owns that can now displayed that wouldn't fit in the old building.\u000a\u000aThere are many audio and video things to look at, there is information about Nevada mining, and you can find out who Emma Nevada was.\u000a\u000aIn the rotating exhibit area, there was an HD photo display by Cameron Grant called "Unexpected Nevada."  His photos are stunning and it's worth visiting just to see this.\u000a\u000aThere is a room for visiting school kids, there's a research room, a new gift shop, and a room for presentations with a wonderful patio outside that has a terrific view of the resort corridor.  You can also look down into the animal habitat of the Springs Preserve.\u000a\u000aThe new museum opens to the public on October 28th.  It's at the far end of the Springs Preserve parking lot.  Go and visit--you won't be disappointed!

VWe met some friends from out of town last night because some of us are fans of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives on the Food Network.  This was a place that Guy Fieri used to patronize when he was a student at UNLV.  What more do you need to give it a try?\u000a\u000aWe got there at 5 and soon two of our friends arrived and 10 minutes later the last got there.  I point that out because there's one table in the dining room that has a sign saying it's reserved for parties of 5 or more.  The waitress knew we were expecting 3 more guests and she brought us drinks.\u000a\u000aWhen everyone was there, we ordered 2 original strombolis and one of the group got a chicken salad but he did try the stromboli.  It's been a lot of years since I ate stromboli in Upstate NY so I was glad when friends from NY suggested eating here.\u000a\u000aThe stromboli was very good.  It had a thin dough which is something few places do.  I like it the way it was made because you're not eating so much bread.  The filling was ham, cheese, pepperoni, and tomato sauce.  We also got a side of extra tomato sauce.  The taste was exactly what I was used to from my past life in NY.  \u000a\u000aService was very good.  Our server was quite friendly and she had a good wit with our salad friend.  I was so pleased that the smoking bar area is glassed off from the eating area.  The Clean Indoor Act really has helped a lot of us.  I'm a fan of the Four Kegs and I'll be back.

VThis is a place that could be straight from Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.  I was meeting friends for breakfast this morning but it fell through and I didn't get the memo.  After sending a text and finding out we weren't meeting, I searched the Yelp app for breakfasts restaurants and this was one of them that came up.  Off I was.\u000a\u000aI was going south on Decatur and drove right on by when I noticed the blue symbol on my map was going away from Lou's.  I made a u-turn on a side street and started north on Decatur and there it was, tucked in a small strip mall removed some from Decatur and not having much curb notice.\u000a\u000aWhen I went in, the first thing I noticed was the large amount of bric-a-brac in the restaurant most of it related to kitchens both commercial and home.  One thing that caught my eye was a box from my first food processor, a Veg-O-Matic.  It made me smile because I realized how old it was and therefore me.\u000a\u000aMy server, Patty, was to my table almost before I sat down (the sign says to seat yourself) and she was back quickly with coffee, a glass of ice water, and a menu.  After looking at the menu for awhile and checking the specials board, I ordered their chili and cheese omelette.  I had my choice of a couple of kinds of potatoes but I went with grits.  I also ordered rye toast.\u000a\u000aWithin a short time, my breakfast was delivered.  Everything was very good.  Patty asked if I wanted any hot sauce other than the Tabasco that was on the table and I asked for Cholula.  There was a nice container of butter with the grits and I let it melt and mixed it around with the grits.\u000a\u000aService was excellent!  Patty was back often to refill my coffee and it was a pleasant breakfast.  Since I was wearing a Syracuse t-shirt so close to the freeway, Patty assumed I was from out of town and she asked where I was from.  When I said Las Vegas, she asked how I found Lou's.  When I said, "Yelp," she asked, "What's Yelp!"  I explained briefly and shower her the app and she got the idea.  She was interested to know I'd be rating Lou's before the day was done.  \u000a\u000aOne last thing--there's a cardboard sign hanging on strings that says "Triple Chocolate Cake" and it has three arrows pointing to a cake holder on the counter.  I couldn't resist.  I bought a piece to bring home and have for dessert tonight.  I'm sure it will be just as good as breakfast!  This is a good breakfast spot.  The hiking group may rue their snubbing of me!\u000a\u000aAddendum:  The chocolate cake was excellent!

VI stopped here in my great new wallet search.  They had one that I was tempted to buy, but this time I'm going to get it right and buy the one that fits my needs.\u000a\u000aThe store is laid out as well as department stores like this.  Aisles are wide but they make you go out of your way to get where you're going so you see more merchandise that might entice you to stop and perhaps make an impulse buy.

VI stopped in here today.  It's been years since I've been to the Meadows Mall and this JC Penney.  The store is OK.  It has a very good inventory.  The store is large and has something for everyone--except the new wallet I'm looking for.\u000a\u000aThere is easier access for me to Penney's at a store nearer to home.  If they don't have what I want and I still want Penney's, I can order it online.

VI haven't been to the Meadows Mall for two years.  I am just not a shopper like that.  Let me buy something online if I can.\u000a\u000aGoing to the Meadows is only something I do as a last resort.  It is a good sized center with good anchor tenants, but I find stand alone stores away from malls more conducive to my needs.\u000a\u000aIt does have a convenient location at 95 and Valley View.  Maybe the Summerlin Mall will get done one of these years and the Meadows won't be a necessary evil.

VI've been to this property several times for shows, so this review is for the casino and showroom only.\u000a\u000aThe Excalibur is dated.  I was surprised by the fact that I didn't dislike it as much as I thought I would.  The place is large and finding the steps to the second floor took me awhile, but once I did it, I was able to get to the second floor showroom easily.\u000a\u000aI am always surprised by the large number of people that are in the casino.  Even when the economy was at its lowest, the place always seemed to be busy.\u000a\u000aThe showroom on the second floor, which is shared  by several productions, is a nice enough room.  The long tables with 8 seats per table can be a little uncomfortable as they have them very close to each other. If the show is good, you don't think of this.\u000a\u000aParking is good in the garage in the back, but it may give you a longer walk to get into the casino.  I generally try to find a surface spot parallel to Trop.\u000a\u000aWhile not one of my favorites on the Strip, the Excalibur is OK for the reasons I go there.

VThe convention center is quite nice.  I find it very easy to navigate the booths and move from one area to another.  I do think the place is in need of some renovation.  Part of that has been put on hold because of the drop in convention business with the economy.\u000a\u000aI come yearly to the Global Gaming Expo and the Consumer Electronics Show.  Both are spread over large areas of the Convention Center.\u000a\u000aThere are several food places, bathroom facilities are scattered throughout, and the Center offers free wifi.  In addition, the monorail station is right out front.  For locals, it's a breeze to park at MGM, buy our $1 monorail ride tickets, and go over traffic to the CC.  No parking problems, and no traffic!  Sweet!

VI had a deeply discounted coupon that I took advantage of today.  I was to Madame Tussaud's last year.  The place hasn't changed a whole lot but the Scream area was open today.  It was closed when I was here before.\u000a\u000aFor the most part, the wax figures are well done.  I probably spent more time here last year because I was with a friend and we took a lot of photos and enjoyed everything.  Today, I simply walked through - looking for any changes - and I people watched - one of the best things about Las Vegas.  You tourists sure are funny!

V*** Review is for Spring Restaurant Week 2014 menu ***\u000a\u000aI've been wanting to try Piero's for many years.  It's one of those places that have a lot of history with the city and some of its famous entertainers and residents.\u000a\u000aI was brought bread and iced tea soon after being seated.\u000a\u000aFor the first course, there was no choice.  It was an agnolotti and cheese combination.  There were five agnolotti in a cream sauce and a triangle shaped piece of fried mozzarella.  The server ground parmesan onto the agnolotti to my liking.  This starter dish was very good.  When eating the fried mozzarella, I couldn't help but think of my students and their senior prom.  They always cleared the place out of mozzarella sticks.  \u000a\u000aThe second course was a choice salads.  I chose the Caesar and the server did freshly ground pepper to my liking.  The romaine was as crisp as can be and the dressing was great!  A large salad course but I managed!\u000a\u000aFor the third course, I had to go with the house specialty--Osso Buco.  It was amazing!  The meat gently came off the bone and the sauce in which the veal shank was braised was very good.  The server brought me a cocktail fork and stuck it in the bone to use as a marrow fork.  A straw would have been a good idea, too!  Along with the Osso Buco, there was a nice sized mound of fettuccine.  It had the brazing sauce poured over it.  Again, the server round parmesan over the dish.  I've had Osso Buco a few times before but it was never this good.  You can tell their process takes hours.  \u000a\u000aService throughout the night was exemplary.  There must have been 10 people at least on duty and every one of them worked every table.  I was asked several times if I wanted a fresh iced tea.  When I finished my first glass, immediately a server appeared to take the glass to be refilled.  An empty pack of Sweet 'n Low was removed within moments of putting it on the table.  One of the servers who hadn't been at my table took my check and payment.  No waiting.  It's all for one and one for all.  \u000a\u000aMany of the Yelp reviews refer to this as old school.  I agree, and I think it's a great idea.  Seeing the servers with white jackets, watching the plates be pushed by my table on a rolling cart, having service that is outstanding--these may be characteristics of old school, and it's good that some places retain their old school ways.\u000a\u000aMy only complaint with the place is the mandatory valet parking.  The lot isn't that big.  I can walk.  If some want to valet, let them.  A requirement--no, it shouldn't be!

VI went to Spago last night before the Rod Stewart concert and it was superb in every way, the room, the food, and the service!  I asked about the 6 course tasting menu and my server described the courses.  When he knew I had a show at 7:30, he thought I might not have enough time for the meal.  The he said, "We'll make it happen.  We'll move things along."  The meat course was the only course in which I had a choice.  You could choose either a filet or a lamb chop. \u000a\u000aIn a few minutes, Michael brought a tray with four kinds of bread--cheese dusted lavash, cheddar bacon rolls, mini baguettes, and a cherry walnut bread.  I asked for some lavash and the bacon cheddar roll.  I didn't want to fill up on bread.  Note:  with the bread, they serve butter with ground salt on top (hooray!)\u000a\u000aThe first course was a seafood course.  There were four compartments on the dish and each one had a small portion of a different fish.  The small spoon had crab, to the right there was some tuna, above on the right was a carpaccio of octopus and to the upper left was albacore tataki.  Each had seasonings including an avocado purée on one, a small piece of melon with another and so on.  Great presentation.  Wonderful flavors!\u000a\u000aCourse 2 was the salad course.  There were two parts to this.  One was a small cup of warm tomato soup that was superb.  I asked Michael if it was on the menu, but it's not.  It really was tasty.  Along with the soup was a salad consisting of a wedge of yellow and red tomato.  It's been a long time since I had tomatoes with so much flesh and almost no seed.  There were 3 or 4 green beans lying diagonally across the tomatoes and there were some small cherry tomatoes and some more avocado purée.  Very light and lots of summer flavor.\u000a\u000aCourse 3 was the first fish course.  A bottom layer had a polenta flan.  On this was the grilled eel and on top of the eel was a fried quail egg.  The dish was decorated with some tasty cheese tuile.  The eel was moist and soft and fell apart with just a touch.  It was perfectly cooked!\u000a\u000aCourse 4 was the pasta course.  It consisted of agnolotti that was topped with pieces of lobster meat and there was some basil olive oil drizzled around the base of the pasta.  This was excellent also!\u000a\u000aCourse 5 was a second fish course--sea bass.  The bass was placed on a layer of what appeared to be thin pasta.  After delving deeper, I found that they were extremely thin, narrow slices of yellow and green squash that could have easily been mistaken for pasta until you tasted them.  Very clever execution and very tasty sea bass.  There was also a piece of melon and a grilled cherry tomato.  You can see how the chef likes to mix contrasting flavors.\u000a\u000aCourse 6 was the meat course and I chose the lamb chop (rare).  It was an herb crusted chop that had been removed from the chop with the bone left there to chew on when the main part was gone. There was some pea purée and some more basil oil.  It was truly superb!\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I first got a plate with three sorbets--blackberry, mango, and raspberry--and there was an extremely thin piece of white chocolate placed in the mango.  It was so delicate it almost melted when I picked it up.  Then I was brought a pretty plate with grasshopper cheesecake and some house made mint ice cream with chocolate flecked throughout.  There were also some chocolate decorations, a loop and a rod that were very good.  Last, I was brought 2 mignardises.  One was a watermelon jelly candy and the other one I think was marshmallow but I may be wrong.\u000a\u000aHuge thanks to a great serving crew--Michael, my server, a young woman who was a busser in my area and had a wonderful personality, and the runners from the kitchen who explained each course beautifully.  It's too bad it wasn't recorded so I got more things correct in this review.\u000a\u000aMichael took my credit card as time got short and I left the restaurant about 10 minutes before the start of Rod Stewart.  They did an outstanding job of moving the courses along and I was in my seat with 5 minutes to spare.\u000a\u000aI have to come back in another season when the dishes are different and do the tasting again and take more time to savor each course.  I don't know why I overlooked Spago for so long!!

VReview for casino only:\u000a\u000aI was at Circus Circus last night to go to their Steak House restaurant.  I had forgotten how large the place is, but coming from the garage in the back, I didn't have to go to the main casino.  I did anyway just to see one of the circus acts.  Roller skating duos must be the rage in Las Vegas with a couple spinning there last night.\u000a\u000aThe place was cleaner than I remembered from years ago.  It's not a place I'd go except for the restaurant, but it is OK.

VI like riding the monorail although I don't ride it frequently.  I use it when I attend CES and G2E.  I park at the MGM Grand garage and ride from the station there above all the traffic and I don't have to worry about parking at the Convention Center.  For Nevada residents, it's a bargain.  We pay $1 each way and can buy two tickets at once.  (Note:  Resident tickets can only be purchased at the MGM and Sahara stations.  You must have ID).\u000a\u000aI can understand people complaining about the price and the location.  It's not the most convenient transportation especially if you're getting off at Paris/Bally's and then have to hoof it to Paris Las Vegas.  But, I hike several miles a week, so the distances are nothing for me.

VI stopped in here for a sweet fix when my RW selection last night didn't have dessert.  I had just enough time before the Jacksons' show to have an ice cream sandwich.  When I asked the young thing behind the counter what flavors they had, she explained you pick any two cookies you want and any of their ice creams.\u000a\u000aI chose a Snickerdoodle and a s'mores cookie and the ice cream I chose was cookie dough.  That's one from each of my 3 food groups.  She placed one cookie on a wooden thing, put a large scoop of ice cream on the cookie, pushed it down to even out the filling, and then she placed the other cookie on top.\u000a\u000aShe placed the ice cream sandwich in a cardboard ice cream cup and placed a spoon in the cup with the cookies and ice cream.\u000a\u000aThe dessert is a bit pricey and sitting on a cushioned bench in the Miracle Mile Shops is not a classy eating experience.  I knew that in advance so that's OK.  The ice cream and the cookies were good .

VI'll raise Cozymel's from a 3 star to a 3 1/2 star rating because of the dessert.  More on that later. \u000a\u000aIt's been probably over 10 years since I ate here once as a tourist.  As I was driving by, heading to a familiar place, I decided to give it a go and try something different.  I was glad I did.  It's standard Tex/Mex.  The food could use a little more spice, but I assume they are directing their seasoning toward the people who want the Tex/Mex flavor without any zing.\u000a\u000aChips and salsa were completely average.  The salsa tasted like it came from a bottle of Pace salsa - nothing special there.  For the entree, I had the Pork Rostistado with "spicy verde sauce" or so the menu says.  The meal came with rice, black beans with some cheese sprinkled on the beans, and some great sauteed vegetables - zucchini and carrots - and the standard container of tortillas. As for the "spicy verde sauce," well it wasn't spicy.  The plain black beans had more zing than the verde sauce.  I asked my server for some Cholula and the dish took on a spicier flavor, more the way I like it.  The pork was very tasty, and in all, it was a good meal.\u000a\u000aOf course, going to a different place means you have to try dessert just to see if the place is on the up and up.  I got their Banana Napoleon that was highly recommended by my server.  It was layers of banana pudding, sweetened, fried tortilla squares, and fresh bananas and whipped cream. She was right.  It was superb, but way too big!  OK, I made the sacrifice and finished it so there was no waste of food from me.\u000a\u000aService was excellent.  My server was a delightful young woman, very attentive, and she brought me refills of my iced tea promptly and without me having to request it.\u000a\u000aI'll be returning.  This is an OK place for what it is, Tex/Mex in a nice atmosphere and a different selection of some menu items.

VI went to a show at the LVH last night and I had a $10 discount coupon for Benihana on my show ticket.  It's been years since I ate here and I decided to give it a go.  You need to like dining with strangers and meeting new people or go somewhere else.  There were four people from Eastern Washington State and two from Texas at our table besides this local.\u000a\u000aWe ordered different things, but the chef kept everything going well. A woman comes and takes your drink orders first.  After being served the drinks, she brings everyone a bowl of Benihana onion soup.  Then you get a Benihana salad.  Then the chef enters the picture by arriving at the table with his cart of food.  He starts by cooking some shrimp and flipping the tails onto his chef's hat.  He does some other tricks with his knives including the standard teppanyaki onion volcano tower which he then sets on fire.  I ordered the Teriyaki steak, extra rare.  He cooked it perfectly.  He was just as good with everyone else around the table for their preferences.\u000a\u000aWith the teppanyaki meal, everyone gets a shrimp appetizer, hibachi vegetables,  dipping sauces, steamed rice and hot green tea.  There is also dessert.  I got the green tea ice cream.  I also paid the premium to have chicken fried rice.\u000a\u000aI was surprised by how much food there was and everyone but me passed on dessert,  Silly people!  I hadn't eaten teppanyaki in a long time, so I found the evening entertaining and the food delicious.  Also, the people with whom I dined were pleasant and we had some good conversation and some good laughs.  It was a fun evening and I'm glad I came here.  I'll have to do it again in a shorter period of time.

VReview for casino:\u000a\u000aI go to the Riviera to see shows - generally the Riviera Comedy Club where I went last night.  The casino is certainly showing its age.  I don't think there's been much of a renovation there in years, at least none that I've noticed.\u000a\u000aThe layout is OK and cocktail service has been prompt.  She stopped by 3 times last night in a very brief time even though the casino was the busiest I've seen it in months (there was an archery competition and convention at their convention center).\u000a\u000aThis is an OK place, but if I were staying or playing more seriously, it would be someplace else.

VI stopped here for dinner on 4/16 after riding Speed with fellow Yelpers.  I had the Reuben sandwich.  It came with curly fries.  Service was top notch.  Everyone was very pleasant, very competent, and they stopped by to see if I needed some more iced tea or anything else.  Service was prompt!\u000a\u000aThe sandwich was quite good.  The corned beef tasted good.  If anything, it could have used a bit more sauerkraut.\u000a\u000aI'm glad I took the time to try this place before it closes.

VBefore seeing Zumanity, I had dinner at Gallagher's, something I haven't done since the 1960s when I ate at the original in New York City.  I had a reservation for 5:30 and was promptly seated in a mostly empty restaurant.  The waiter was soon at the table with ice water and to take a drink order quickly.\u000a\u000aAfter finding out the weights of the various steaks. I didn't want 18+ ounces in a steak so I ordered their "signature house-aged bone in sirloin."  I ordered it cooked blue.  I also ordered a side of the Special Spud.  Last night, it was mashed potatoes with jalapeño pieces, bacon bits, and cheddar cheese.  For dessert I got the Sticky toffee pudding.\u000a\u000aI was brought a nice bread basket with two types of bread and some whipped butter.  The server brought my iced tea and it was kept filled throughout the time I was there.  The steak came and it was done exactly the way I like it--nice grill marks on the outside and cold, red on the inside.  It was a good steak.  The Special Spud was very good, probably the highlight of the evening which isn't necessarily a good thing when a side is what you remember your dinner for.  The sticky toffee pudding was good, also.  It came with some whipped cream and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.\u000a\u000aService was attentive and pleasant from the time I was greeted at the door to leaving. My server was Bobby and he was a very pleasant gentleman.  I enjoyed the ambience of the restaurant and it got to be fun when some more people came in and I could overhear the tourist talk going on.\u000a\u000aA solid steakhouse but it's not in my top tier of Las Vegas steakhouses.\u000a\u000aNote:  For those on vacation, they have a photographer come around and take photos so you can remember that special dinner in Las Vegas.  I enjoyed seeing the couple two tables down from me look at the finished photos and purchase one to take home.

VI had a comp ticket to see Love again and I decided to try another of the Mirage restaurants.  I made a reservation for 5 PM and the restaurant opened right on time and I was seated in the main dining room quickly.  The main room is a really attractive place.  Warm and inviting with lots of wood, dim lighting but not too dim, and comfortable seats.\u000a\u000aI had looked at the 3 course show dinner which allows some choice but after a bit of thought, I ordered from the menu.  It ended up being the same price and I had more choice.\u000a\u000aAfter ordering, I was brought some ciabatta bread and two baguettes that were small bread stick size.  There was a dish with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping.  The bread was very good.\u000a\u000aFor an appetizer, I got the grilled octopus.  There were five nice size pieces on a bed of chick pea purée with some roasted Pachino tomatoes and frisée.  The octopus was excellent, very tender with a nice grilled flavor.\u000a\u000aMy main course was rigatoncini Bolognese.  It came with a good sized dollop of ricotta and the waiter brought pepper over and ground some fresh pepper as he had for the octopus.  I was also offered freshly grated cheese but I declined to enjoy just the ricotta flavor.  The rigatoncini was just al dente and the meat sauce was excellent.  It did not have a sweet taste as I used to have when my mother and mother-in-law made their own meat sauces.  This was great!\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I generally shy away from warm desserts.  It's just a preference of mine to have something room temperature or cold.  After looking for some time at a nice list of choices, I opted to break my own mold and go with their warm apple cinnamon pie with vanilla gelato and caramel.  It was excellent and I'm glad I didn't follow my normal pattern.  The apple crumb had a good cinnamon flavor and the vanilla gelato was rich and creamy.  A very good ending to an excellent meal.\u000a\u000aA word about the service--it was as good as it gets.  The servers were attentive, professional, and friendly.   Dishes were promptly removed when a course was finished.  When my server came to check on me during the main course, he said he'd have another iced tea brought.  As he said that, we both saw one of the staff bringing me a fresh glass.  They didn't refill, they replaced with a full, new glass.  They were very impressive with their service.  \u000a\u000aA memorable meal in a very pleasant setting!  Onda is a winner.

VI dined here tonight (4/25/10) and chose from their prix fixe menu.  Everything about the dinner was perfect.  The service was excellent.  Usually, there were two or three waiters/bus staff at a table when a course was brought.  I was brought a second iced tea when I still had 1/3 glass remaining and I didn't have to ask.  The meal was wonderful.  I had the Duck Confit Caesar salad for an appetizer, Filet Mignon and Crab Gratin for the main course, and Buttermilk Spice Cake for dessert.\u000a\u000aThe ambience of Kokomo's is very nice.  If you're familiar with the Mirage, it's a part of the area under the dome - the atrium  with live palm trees, blooming orchids, and tourists in the distance walking through the atrium.\u000a\u000aA friend suggested this was a good place to go after dark when the room is darker with soft lighting.  I can understand that now, and I plan to return for a dinner when it's dark out.\u000a\u000aI was so pleased with the dinner and the staff that I know I will be returning!

VReview is for Spring Restaurant Week 2012 menu:\u000a\u000aI have often read about how good this place is and I wanted to try it.  What better way than Restaurant Week.  \u000a\u000aThe bread basket had a very tasty piece of lavash, a seeded roll of some kind, a pretzel roll,  and two slices of raisin bread.  The raisin bread was also good and the basket came with the bread warmed.\u000a\u000aCourse 1:  I chose the black bean soup which was served with a small dish of chopped red onion and a tiny pitcher of sherry.  The onion added to the somewhat bland soup.  Since I don't do alcohol, I guess the sherry would kick it up a notch.  I depended on some salt.  It was a good starter.\u000a\u000aCourse 2:  I had to do the Filet Oscar and I wasn't disappointed.  It's a 12 ounce monster so go hungry!  I asked for it cooked black and blue and it was--nicely charred on the outside and blue from shivering on the inside.  These steak chefs know how to cook a steak the right way.  If you look at my photos, you can see the flaming grill.  My steak was in the middle of the flame for a short while.  The cook took some beef skin from a rib roast a put it on the grill.  When the fat dripping onto the mesquite flared up, he placed my steak in the middle.  With the steak came some nice king crab meat, two asparagus spears, and some excellent Bernaise.  I opted for the bake potato and the vegetable for the evening was baby carrots.  Before the entrée was brought, a server had delivered to the table a plate with 4 small dishes with chives, butter, sour cream, and bacon bits.  You could load up your baked potato, or not, any way you wanted.  I like the do it yourself style.\u000a\u000aCourse 3:  For dessert, they bring the dessert cart to your table.  There was a chocolate mousse cake, their take on Bananas Foster with the ingredients in a martini glass, cheesecake, some others I can't remember and the raspberry chocolate cake I ordered.  It was great!\u000a\u000aMy server was Mitch and he was an attentive and pleasant fellow.  I would have given this 5 stars but for a few things that caused my downgrade.  There was some crab shell in my king crab.  The carrots were very crisp--undone crisp--and were only lukewarm.  I was there at 5 when they opened so they weren't done enough yet.  Later as I watched the chefs place carrots on dishes, I could see the steam coming from them.  Finally, I had a long wait for an iced tea refill the first time I requested it.  Otherwise, service was good.\u000a\u000aNote:  They do not take the M-Life card if you're using the purchase for tier credits.  For some reason (well we know why), Circus Circus is the poor stepchild of the MGM Resorts.  Your check will say use your M-Life card, but you can't.\u000a\u000aI'll be back.  This is a gem of a place.

VThis review is for the showroom only:\u000a\u000aI have been here for 3 shows.  They call their little showroom off the lobby the Las Vegas Comedy Showroom.  Tonight I saw Robert Nash--All Wrapped Up In Characters.  Nash in an excellent impressionist doing most of the standard impersonations--Satchmo, Elvis, Dean Martin, Robert DeNiro et. al.\u000a\u000aThe showroom is small, perhaps holding 150 people.  There is no bad seat and it's quite comfortable.\u000a\u000aThe Alexis Park is a nice property.  I'll be back for more shows and to try their restaurant.

VI stopped today to try the lunch buffet.  What a great idea it was and thanks to my fellow Yelpers for their reviews that helped me make my decision.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant was almost empty when I arrived at 12:30.  Service was excellent and I know it would have been even if there were a lot of people there.\u000a\u000aWhile I was looking the buffet over, the waiter brought me an iced tea as requested.  Shortly after returning to the table, another server brought me a basket of fresh naan.\u000a\u000aHere's what I tried:\u000a\u000aVegetable pakora - good but not a lot of spice\u000agoat curry - nice spice and very tasty\u000asaag paneer with cheese - flavorful with a nice zing\u000abasmati rice - standard\u000anaan - plain and good\u000achana masala - excellent with a nice spiciness\u000abhindi masala - this was noted as a house favorite.  I didn't think there was anything special about the okra nor the potatoes and it lacked much flavor\u000anavratan lorna - good\u000akarahi lamb - nice flavor and good spice\u000achicken tikka masala - excellent\u000aras malai - excellent sweet to end this feast\u000a\u000aLest you worry that I cleaned the place out, let me assure you I didn't.  I took small portions of all these things just to try them.  Since I was alone, I had a great time watching the Bollywood Bang-Bang music videos on their TV screens.  \u000a\u000aI'm anxious to come back for a relaxed dinner with friends and enjoy being served and trying some things on the evening menu that don't show on the buffet.

VIt has been awhile since I was to McCormick & Schmick's and we decided to go here before our show at the Venetian last night.  At 5:30 and the hour and a half we were there, the place was almost empty.  Unusual for a Thursday night.\u000a\u000aWe just ordered main courses and saved room for dessert.  I ordered the chef's recommended stuffed Atlantic salmon.  This was a nice piece of salmon with some lump crabmeat and bay shrimp in a brie sauce.  It came with some lightly cooked thinly sliced carrots and some green beans.  The dish was very good.  My wife ordered the parmesan crusted chicken which came with lemon caper butter and linguini Alfredo.  This, too, was very good.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, we shared a molten lava chocolate cake with chocolate and caramel sauces.  It was topped with vanilla bean ice cream.  The dessert was fantastic!  It is similar to the other places that have some kind of molten chocolate dessert.  It seems to be one of the in desserts now.\u000a\u000aService was outstanding.  Our server, Dan, was around often but was not intrusive.  One of the managers also came around during the meal to see how things were. Our iced teas were refilled without asking, Dan was a very pleasant fellow, and we completely enjoyed our meal at McCormick & Schmick's.  We'll be back and sooner this time.

VReview is for Spring Restaurant Week 2012 menu:\u000a\u000a*** 4.5 stars ***\u000a\u000aThis is truly a throwback to a bygone era.  Classy, old school, soft lighting, nice music quietly playing so you can have a conversation--you know--like the good old days.\u000a\u000aCourse 1:  The Original Spinning Bowl Salad--Crisp romaine and iceberg lettuce, baby spinach, shredded beets, chopped eggs and croutons, tossed with our exclusive Vintage Dressing (from the Lawry's menu.  The server wheels a cart with a stainless bowl of greens.  This bowl is in a second bowl that has ice to keep the greens chilled.  The server spins the bowl in the ice and lifts the Lawry's salad dressing high and pours it over the spinning bowl.  It's plated and served.  Very old school way of doing things but it's lots of fun.  \u000a\u000aCourse 2:  I chose the Lawry cut of prime rib--a 10 ounce slice of prime rib.  The other option was salmon but why the hell would I come to this restaurant to eat salmon?  The ribs are wheeled in a large covered cart to your table where the server asks you how you want the prime rib done and what sides you want.  I went with the standard mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.  While the chef was cutting the meat and putting the sides together, my server, Mrs. Bender (sort of like Charlotte Rae from "The Facts of Life" TV show) went off to the kitchen to get my Yorkshire pudding, something I haven't had in years.  The chef placed the meat on my table, and she used two forks to cut the pudding into four roughly equal pieces/.  She had already brought a mild and strong horseradish, so I was ready to dig in.  The meat was tender.  No steak knife is needed here and the potatoes and creamed spinach were top notch!\u000a\u000aCourse 3:  How can you get to dessert and not choose a chocolate bag.  Too bad it wasn't the size of a Macy's shopping bag but you can't have everything!  The menu describes the bag this way:  Filled with a double rich Belgium mousse, fresh assorted berries with a raspberry Chambord sauce, topped with mint and shaved chocolate.  The bag is a rectangular shaped piece of chocolate filled with the goodies described.  It was superb!\u000a\u000aThe whole experience was pleasant from being greeted at the door and the woman who verified my reservation.  I especially liked the sign telling men to take the damn hats off before entering the dining room.  It's a shame the sign has to be there, but I liked it!  Mrs. Bender was a gem.  She was like a little house mother with her cart, her spinning bowl, her orchestrating the various aspects so the cart got to me and the meat was what I wanted before she dashed to get the Yorkshire pudding.  Service was impeccable.  \u000a\u000aNote:  The good old days weren't as good as we think they were.  We're just getting older and the past seems a gentler time.

VI had the 5 course tasting menu here tonight - 10 May 2010.  Service was impeccable, the view outstanding, of course, and the food was excellent.  I was ready to give 5 stars until I got to the lamb.  It was a bit tough (something I rarely, if ever say).  It also was a bit too done for my taste even though the photo shows it a nice pink.  I like rarer meat.\u000a\u000aThomas was my server and he was quite pleasant, efficient, and explained anything I wanted to know.  \u000a\u000aI really should go back when the sun goes down earlier.  For the first hour I was there, the shades were drawn most of the way.  Ah, the problem of living in a place where the sun almost always shines.\u000a\u000aOne note about manner of dress - as I was waiting for the elevator to return to the casino level, the elevator staging person talked to a young man waiting with his wife.  He had on jeans and a sport shirt.  The elevator guy said, "Come back and see us again, and this time, I'll have a jacket we can lend you to wear.  You'll look so good."  I don't think the couple cared for the backhanded comment about his manner of dress.

VSince my original review in the Spring of 2010, I have been back to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant twice for lunch and it's time for me to update my review.\u000a\u000aI came here July 18th with my wife for lunch.  We had a 1 PM reservation and were promptly seated at the window with a view of The cosmopolitan and CityCenter to our left and the Bellagio to the right.  No fountain shows during lunch, but it's not needed.  The food provides the show.\u000a\u000aWe were escorted in the elevator by an employee.  When we arrived at the 11th floor, the floor of the tower where the restaurant is located, we saw the kitchen directly across from us.  The employee walked over, picked up a silver tray, and offered us each one of their extraordinarily tasteful cheese gougères.  A sort of amuse-bouche before even being seated.  \u000a\u000aFor lunch, I ordered the baked crêpes and my wife got the parmesan crusted chicken breast.  We started the meal with a bowl of creamy French onion soup, very different from traditional onion soup.  We each were also served two more gougères, larger than the morsels we got at the elevator.  My lunch came with some mini greens on top.  My wife's chicken was accompanied by potatoes gratin and haricots vert.  Both dishes were excellent.  My crêpes were filled with ground artichoke and walnuts and were served with a tomato coulis and some roasted basil.  For dessert, we shared a molten chocolate cake.\u000a\u000aI enjoy coming here so much because service is always top notch.  The servers are very helpful and friendly.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is classy.  The view, the food, the service--they go together to make a memorable occasion.  I have to come back again in the evening and have the tasting menu dinner.  \u000a\u000aChef Joho and his staff really have this place working well in every aspect!

VThis is a great place to make a quick stop for coffee, snacks, or bathroom--not listed in any order.  I am impressed how clean the areas are always kept.  \u000a\u000aIt's an easy off/on from the freeway.  It's not my normal gas up place, but it's a super stop for me.\u000a\u000aThere's a not a whole lot to say about a Petro Center except they're pretty darn good!

VThe theaters here have been well covered by previous reviews.  I like Regal Village Square because it's less hectic than others.  Parking is easy and the numbers of people going here seems to be less than Regal Red Rock.  It's about the same distance for me to go to Red Rock or Village Square, and for most movies, I choose the more laid back atmosphere of Village Square.

VWe have stopped here on several occasions for something different.  Today's stop was not typical.  When we went to be seated, they suggested we sit in the bar area as they had two large parties in the main dining room- one with 70 people and one with 20.  We were told that it would be difficult to take our orders and get served in the dining room.  We decided to sit in the bar area.\u000a\u000aWe didn't know it at the time, but our orders went to the kitchen right after the orders for the 70 something party.  Little did we know it would be a long wait.  \u000a\u000aAfter about 20 minutes, pour waitress came by and apologized for the delay and said the food would be coming soon.  She offered us chips and salsa to munch on until the food came.  We declined.\u000a\u000aTen minutes later, she stopped by again and asked if the manager had been by.  She said the manager would be bringing our meals presently and again she apologized.  WIthin a few minutes, the manager did bring our meals and apologized offering to give us two desserts or a discount on the check.  We declined dessert and when she brought the check, she had deducted the cost of the one meal.  That was great customer service and was certainly a way to bring us back.  The thing I wish, however, is that they would be honest up front.  Had I known the wait would have been that long, I would have gone elsewhere.  Had I known -  had they told me.\u000a\u000aAs for the food, I had chicken fajitas and my wife had their Chicken Monterrey.  Both dishes were normal Chili's dishes and everything tasted great.  It's a shame the dinner was diminished by the service issues, but I can understand the problem of dealing with that many people in one large party.\u000a\u000aKudos to the manager for the way she handled the situation.

VI am a platelet/plasma donor at this site.  I go once a month, and I have almost completely positive things to say about everyone here.  I left off one star because of a phlebotomist who just doesn't seem to give a damn doing the job correctly.  She has the personality of a slug and she moves a tad faster than that.\u000a\u000aIn the nine years I have been going to this center, there has been a large turnover.  I think people get trained, get some experience, and then move on to better paying jobs.\u000a\u000aStill, the act of donating blood or its components is one of the most satisfying things you can do.  It takes an investment of time but the rewards are great.  In addition, free cookies and gifts after the donation aren't bad, either.  And, you accumulate points.  I have enough points now for 15 free movie tickets.  Not bad.\u000a\u000aGo and join the blood crew who do this regularly.

VI've been to this location a number of times, but the convenience of getting in and out makes this less than the most desirable location.\u000a\u000aService has always been very good.\u000a\u000aYesterday, I had a free drink and I stopped at this Starbucks.  As Ken states, you've been to one you've pretty much been to all Starbucks.  It is small.  \u000a\u000aIt certainly isn't my Starbucks of choice, but it's A-OK.

VI stopped here to pick up some 1/2 price Christmas cards for next year.  It's the best way to buy them each year.\u000a\u000aParking is easy and I've found that getting in and out is quite easy.

VI am a fan but I don't shop here that often.  I stopped in yesterday to get something already prepared for our dinner, but their selection was almost all vegetables with only turkey breast being animal protein.  I ended up getting something from the meat counter and grilling at home.  So much for a time saver.\u000a\u000aI do enjoy their salad bar, and I have bought cheese from their excellent suggestion.  I glanced at the seafood section and I did not see any poke again.  I guess it just didn't sell enough.\u000a\u000aI like the store and I'll return but only for those special purchases that I can't get elsewhere.

VI was on my way to Archi's Thai Cafe once again for dinner, but I changed at the last minute and decided to try Rising Sun.  I've been by there many, many times and just never tried it although I wanted to.\u000a\u000aI was pleased with the two rolls I got  --  a Rising Sun and a Red Dragon.  The Rising Sun was with shrimp, lobster, and crab rolled in thinly sliced cucumber.  The Red Dragon was spicy tuna with avocado and cream cheese.  Both were very good, but I thought the rolls were pricey for what you got.  $32.90 for two rolls and an iced tea.  The knife work of the sushi chef in making the Rising Sun was fantastic.  Slicing the cucumber extremely thin to make it the wrapper looked simple to him.  I guess that and the good flavors -- I won't take anything away from the place for the quality, was what I paid for.\u000a\u000aNext time, I'll go to Oyshi  and have AYCE sushi, done well, too, at less than what I paid for two rolls.

VI'm not a member here, but I took my neighbor shopping here.  It appears to be a nice enough discount warehouse store.  The only thing that really got me was that they had to take all four bags of 40 pound water softener salt out of our cart and move it to another.  It seems such a stupid waste of effort.

VI stopped by this Einstein Brothers this morning to get  1/2 dozen bagels.  I so wanted salt bagels, but they had none, even at 7:30 AM.  In the end, I got two everything, 2 - three cheese, and two pretzel bagels - like a salt bagel, but made with a darker wheat so it looks like a soft pretzel.\u000a\u000aMy biggest surprise was the price.  For 6, the tab was just over $7.  There was an additional charge for the pretzel bagels and for the three cheese.  I had one of the pretzel bagels when I got home.  It was good, but I think I'll just get a couple of bagels at Albertson's and go to Einstein when I want something more exotic.\u000a\u000aThey used to give a shmear tub with  1/2, but evidently that ended.

VThanks to Ken M. who organized an UYE here tonight, I got to try their new wild game sliders.  They were added to the menu last fall.  The six sliders are made from the following game animals:  alligator, antelope, buffalo, jackalope (rabbit and antelope meat mixed together), rabbit and wild boar.  They come 3 for $16 (must be all one kind of meat) or a sampler platter of all 6 for $30.\u000a\u000aThree of us shared the sampler and we each had a taste of all 6 meats.  My rating would be from best to least: Rabbit, wild boar, alligator, antelope, jackalope, and bison.  All had sauces to enhance the flavors of the meat.  For example, the wild boar had red currant jelly and sharp cheddar cheese while alligator had a remoulade sauce and a fried egg.  There was a toothpick to break the yolk and make the alligator meat really flavorful!  The platter also came with some waffle cut sweet potato fries which were really yam fries--not sweet potato.  This was a good choice, and I'm glad Tony and Clint shared the sampler with me.\u000a\u000aService was good, and I had a mug of their on site brewed root beer.  Another great UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) with a nice bunch of people at a good place.\u000a\u000aPhoto of the six sliders with the animal depictions on the toothpicks:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XeDLyY2a7nZ3IEY4RYslXA?select=1iaD27IslbUgrrdPt1O2sg

VI don't go to office supply stores much, but I needed some copies made and it was on my way home.  The copying process is fast and easy.  It's amazing how quickly you pick up using a copy machine again after spending a career working in public schools.  It just goes to show you I was taught by the best secretaries there are!!!\u000a\u000aBack to Office Max - as I said, getting copies made was quick and checkout was fairly easy.  I know it's the "most wonderful time of the year" -- back to school and I don't have to go back -- so there was some line but checkout wasn't painfiul.  \u000a\u000aThis business rates its A-OK easily!

VI called another Thai place today for take out only to find out they now close on Tuesday.  I remembered the King and I had their menu stuffed in the doors of the neighborhood about a week ago.  OK, on with Plan B.\u000a\u000aI got their Curry Duck and my wife got the Chicken with garlic and black pepper sauce.  She got 0 for spiciness.  I asked the order taker what their scale was.  It's a 1 to 4 so I ordered it at 4.  She confirmed I wanted extra spicy, and we had a short wait before I drove to The Lakes to get the food.  I loved my duck.  Superb!  She gave me two containers with extra spice, and I used some of that, too.  Their 4 isn't really a four.  It would be about a 6 on a 1 to 10 scale.\u000a\u000aMy wife wasn't as fond with her dish.  It had the dreaded cilantro that she dislikes, and she refuses to stop being a kid, grow up, and learn to eat various types of food.  Oh well, opposites attract.\u000a\u000aI'm glad we had the Tuesday closing.  Now I have two dependable and very good Thai restaurants nearby.

VYou know that feeling you get when it's 9 PM and your only meal of the day was brunch with friends at 2 PM.  Your stomach is saying, "Feed me, feed me now."  I succumbed and went to Baskin Robbins instead of one of the frozen yogurt places I normally haunt.\u000a\u000aI got two cups of hand packed ice cream - chocolate truffle and chocolate peanut butter.  My chocolate PB was very good and my wife informed me her truffle was equally good.\u000a\u000aService was quick and the price was right.  I got a fix, quieted my stomach, and enjoyed some ice cream without all the toppings I'd add if I'd been for yogurt.

VI'd really give this 2.5 stars, but three would be too many.  I had the Classic Cobb Salad.  My wife had the Lemon Grilled Chicken.  Service was good, but the place is just so so.  I think it's well over-priced for what you get.  No appetizers, no desserts, two iced teas and the above dishes and our bill was $33 before tip.\u000a\u000aI did feel quite good, however, when I realized that the median age of the people in the place was greater than my age.  Geez, a youngster out on a date.  That's OK though.  I know the Callendar's draws a large clientele of gray hairs like me and I'm cool with that.\u000a\u000aI guess the only reason to visit Marie anymore is to have some pie and some coffee or tea.

V*** 3.5 stars ***\u000a\u000aI stopped here for breakfast.  It's been several years since I've been to Mimi's and I thought breakfast would be a good way to try the place again.\u000a\u000aI got the quatre fromage quiche which their menu describes as Swiss, brie, feta and parmesan cheese with sun dried tomatoes and hickory smoked bacon. Served with baby greens, fresh fruit and a freshly baked muffins.\u000a\u000aThe quiche was very good tasting and the size was a perfect amount for breakfast.  I did not, however, receive any muffin or bread.  I didn't see the muffin on the menu when I ordered or I would have asked.  I thought with the pastry crust of the quiche, that would be equivalent to toast.\u000a\u000aMy server, Marie, was very pleasant and refilled my coffee often.

VI went to the Family Music Center last night to see the musical "Oliver" in their performance section at the back of the store.  While waiting for the house to open, I browsed the instruments throughout the store and had great fun.  \u000a\u000aIn the front of the store, there was a square grand piano.  I later learned from one of the sales staff that this type of piano was not made after the late 1800s so this was a museum piece.  The story of why they were made square was quite interesting.\u000a\u000aThere's another room in the building that has a large number of pianos.  Another had violins while yet another had guitars.  I had some fun plucking the strings on a banjo to see what sounds I could make. I know why I never became an entertainer!\u000a\u000aThis store has a lot of music related items.  In the back, get your guitar picks, your guitar strings, and any sheet music you need.\u000a\u000aThe performance area is a 100 seat venue.  It's quite nice with comfortable chairs.  Sight lines from anywhere are great.  There are many shows going on here.

VI came here once and knew I would never return.  It wasn't that the food was bad.  They had no hot sauce other than Tabasco.  CAn you imagine a Tex/Mex restaurant without Cholula or Tapatio? \u000a\u000aI sent a comment to the company via their website and I never got an answer.  With so many Tex/Mex choices available, I'll be glad to drive by this place and keep on going!

VI shop at the 99 Cents Only store to buy the sugar free cans of Arizona iced tea.  This is not available in grocery stores, so this is my go to place for my drink of choice for after hiking.\u000a\u000aPeriodically I will look around, but I usually am on my way somewhere else and I don't find much.  I know if I looked more, especially at the produce, I would find some deals.  \u000a\u000aThe staff is generally pleasant and I find check out to be something of a wait because there are few stations open.\u000a\u000aI'll return for my Arizona diet tea.

VAfter having three flat tires in 5 weeks, I decided to try another bike store to see about why it was happening.  The service member who looked at my bike put some new wheel tape in to guard against the spoke connectors rubbing the tube and getting a flat.\u000a\u000aI rode for 8 miles yesterday and I didn't have to push the bike home with a flat tire.  It was great!  Now if it will just continue for another week and then another.\u000a\u000aI really was pleased with my service and this will change to a 5 star review when the tube lasts like it should!

VI can now update this review and give the Las Vegas Cyclery the full 5 stars.  When I first came here, I had gotten the third flat tire (same one) in 5 weeks.  \u000a\u000aWhen the repair guy looked at the inside rim, he saw that the wheel liner needed something better to protect the tubes.  The inside of the spokes were causing the rear tire to go flat.\u000a\u000aAs I was leaving, he said, "If that goes bad within 30 days, you bring it back and we'll take care of it!"\u000a\u000aIt's been three months and I haven't had another flat.  Almost 300 miles on that tube and it's still working well!\u000a\u000aThe Cyclery deserves the 5th star!

VWe stopped here for something different.  I had looked at the menu online and decided on the kebab trio--a dinner with koobideh, chicken, and lamb kebabs.  Served with the meal are vermicelli pilaf, basmati rice, a house salad, and grilled tomato and red pepper.\u000a\u000aI started my meal with a cup of their summer soup available for a limited time.  It's a cucumber yogurt cold soup with walnut pieces and golden raisins for a touch of sweetness.  The soup was topped with some croutons and garnished with a sprig of mint.  It was excellent!  Very different and very refreshing.\u000a\u000aFor the main course, the kebab trio was perfect for the two of us.  My wife does not like lamb.  By sharing the trio, I was able to have some lamb while she stuck with chicken and koobideh.  Of the three, the koobideh was the star of the dish.  The lamb was cooked too much--I had requested rare and it was more on the medium side.  It was also a bit tough.  The chicken was OK but there wasn't much spice to it.  The koobideh, on the other hand, was done medium rare as I asked and it was flavorful and very enjoyable.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, my wife got the rice pudding (it was very good), and I got an order of baklava--also very good.\u000a\u000aService was not the best.  We waited at the podium for about 5 minutes before anyone came to seat us.  My iced tea wasn't refilled in a timely manner and even though there were only a few other diners in the room, our server seemed to disappear for long periods of time only checking back with us once near the end of our dinner.  I also thought it was a bit tacky to take the dessert order, enter it into a nearby terminal, and then put the bill on the table before clearing the dishes and well before dessert was brought.  Bad form.\u000a\u000aIf I decide to come back, it will be for takeout, but with other choices in the area for Mediterranean food, I probably will go elsewhere.

VI like Cold Stone Creamery but it's a place I seldom go because I think their cost is out of whack when there are whole lot of yogurt stores in the area.  I had a Groupon for this location, so I stopped in yesterday.  \u000a\u000aI got two Signature cups to bring home--peanut butter cup and cheesecake fantasy.  I ate the PB when I got home and it was creamy and tasty.  The cheesecake awaits in the freezer for the night I will attack its goodness.\u000a\u000aI will be back to use another Groupon but that will probably be the end of stopping here.  There are much better values elsewhere!

VReview for Restaurant Week 2011 menu:\u000a\u000aService started with a small bowl of edamame.  Another restaurant that does something than give you a bread basket.  Good idea.\u000a\u000aCourse 1:  Lobster pot stickers with miso butter sauce.  The pot stickers were grilled perfectly and the plating was nicely done.  I expected a stronger lobster flavor, but it is ground filling so maybe my expectations were too high.  They were very tasty.\u000a\u000aCourse 2:  Macadamia nut encrusted mahi mahi eith lobster essence.  The mahi mahi was tender and soft as it should be and it was moist and cooked perfectly.  There was a base of a small amount of potato puree that held some red potato slices on which the mahi mahi was placed.  It was crowned by asparagus spears.  A fine main course and just the right amount.\u000a\u000aCourse 3:  Melting hot chocolate soufflé with raspberry sauce and vanilla bean ice cream.  This isn't a traditional souffle, but it comes close to it.  The melted chocolate inside was very hot and you needed to wait for it to cool before really trying more than the tiniest taste.\u000a\u000aService:  Everyone was great!  When i was seated, I was in the dining room at a table meant for 4 people.  I had noticed the kitchen bar/sushi bar seating when I was going to my table.  I asked the hostess if I could sit there instead and she said, "You can sit just about anywhere you want.  Come on."\u000a\u000aI like restaurants that have a counter area that overlooks the cooks doing their thing.  I also had a good time talking with a couple of them and they showed me some of the dishes they had made before they were served because they noticed my inquisitive look at what they were doing.  This made the meal all the more enjoyable!\u000a\u000aMy server was there to ask how each course was after I had chance to try them, and he refilled my iced tea promptly.  Altogether, this was a wonderful dining experience.  I am sure I'll be returning to Roy's.  This RW menu gave me a good taste of their food and the whole experience showed me what they're like.

VI've stopped at this AutoZone when I've needed small things for my cars.  I am not a do it yourself kind of person so it's always for something easy.\u000a\u000aMy xTerra has a burned out stop light bulb and I went here yesterday to get a replacement.  Having watched a YouTube video on changing the bulb, I felt like I was Super Mechanic as I sauntered in the store.\u000a\u000aI found the booklet with the list of cars and found the number bulb I needed.  The gentleman who was at the counter verified my choice and I got the correct replacement.  I then asked him about changing the license plate bulbs to LED bulbs.  He came outside to my car, got down on the ground, and showed me how easy it is to change them.  I bought the two LED bulbs.\u000a\u000aI have always found the people who staff the store to be very helpful like this.  They go above and beyond to help.  Now if the guy would just bring me a socket set, I'd be able to change the bulb for which I went.  OK, I'll borrow a socket set from a hiking friend.  And, I'll continue to stop here for this kind of minor thing.

VThis is a review for my wife.  I was going out for dinner last night and she didn't want the food I was going to be having so I had to provide something for her.  After giving several choices, she opted for Arby's whose Market Fresh sandwiches she liked in the past.\u000a\u000aI drove down and got a turkey ranch with bacon Fresh Market sandwich and an order of curly fries.  I was home in no time at all.  When I got in late last night, she elated how good her dinner was.  She liked the sandwich and the fries were something that haven't been in the house for years.\u000a\u000aNow from my perspective, service was just OK.  The counter critter who took my order was lethargic and that's being kind.  After taking my order, she went about filling some others and motioned to me when my order was ready.  There was only one person in the restaurant besides me and only two cars at the drive through.\u000a\u000aOverall, the place gets an A-OK rating.  My wife was happy, I didn't have to make something for her at home, and I was off to Bouchon for some French Bastille Day food.  Win win!

VI have been going to try Rosemary's for quite awhile.  It's just down the street a few miles, but I never got around to it.  I recently got a gift certificate for Rosemary's as a result of an NPR donation so off I was to try it out.  I had spoken to a friend who's been here with his wife several times, and I decided to sit where he suggested.  When I arrived about 15 minutes early, I requested a seat at the rear food bar.  There is a counter that looks directly into the cooking area with the two grills and you can watch Leonard and Jason do their magic--along with the rest.\u000a\u000aI decided to do the 5 course tasting menu.  Smart idea--it was great.  I had two amuse-bouche--an eggplant caviar on a fried wonton and sauteed mushrooms.  \u000a\u000aThe courses:\u000a\u000aFirst:  Duo of Tartars - Beef and salmon tartars.  The beef tartar was on a soft boiled egg, part on each egg half.  Very nice plating.\u000a\u000aSecond:  Pan seared pompano on a bed of sauteed spinach.  This was the first time I had pompano and I was pleased with the taste of the pompano and I liked it a lot.\u000a\u000aThird:  Texas BBQ shrimp with Maytag blue cheese slaw.  Outstanding!  The combination of BBQ sauce with the blue cheese and slaw was amazing!\u000a\u000aFourth:  Rack of Lamb over sauteed kale.  Another winner!  Perfect rare cooking for the lamb and very tasty.  I wanted to gnaw on the bones.\u000a\u000aFifth:  Dessert - this was a trio of desserts - creme brulee, chocolate cake, and a beer float.  Since I had no alcohol, the server asked if I'd want root beer instead of the lambic beer they use and I chose the root beer.  The trio was quite tasty, especially the creme brulee.\u000a\u000aAfter dessert, I was brought some mignardises, a brownie,  a lemon square, and a peanut butter cookie.\u000a\u000aService was impeccable.  Before my iced tea was finished, the server brought me a fresh glass when I had less than 1/3 left.  He asked me again later if I need another replacement and he was there in a few moments.\u000a\u000aSome of my friends from Yelp have mentioned the saltiness of some things.  I noticed that last night, but as a person to loves salt, it was not an issue for me.  You might want to be aware of this in advance.\u000a\u000aI have to say a word about my seating.  SInce I dined alone, this was just perfect.  I enjoyed watching the kitchen staff do their thing and it was great fun to watch the ballet of grilling, searing, sauteeing, and plating that took place before me.  Even if you were there with a significant other, it would be a good place to sit but not for a romantic dinner.\u000a\u000aThis was a superb dinner--5 star all the way!  I will be back!

VI decided to have an easy dinner and it's been awhile since I got Chinese take out.  The reviews of Pearl Wok To Go were good and I went there.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Szechuan trio which was chicken, scallops, and shrimp.  It was good but it wasn't very spicy.  I need to ask for extra spice when I order.  I got garlic chicken for my wife.  It, too, was good but there wasn't much of a garlic flavor.  There were some cut up fresh garlic in the stir fry that didn't have much taste at all.\u000a\u000aWe each got a cup of soup--me hot and sour and wonton for my wife.  These were the standouts of my order.  We also got two complimentary egg rolls.  They give one with a purchase of a certain amount and I guess since we got two dinners, we got two egg rolls.\u000a\u000aThe portions were large.  We have leftovers for tomorrow night.  I think I've really lost my taste for Chinese stir fry.  It just doesn't cut it anymore.

VI have a love/hate relationship with this store.  I get so irritated when they don't re-stock the shelves and are often out of items I need.  I also try to avoid the place on weekends  because I want to avoid people bringing their dogs to the store with them.  I like dogs, but I don't like bratty, barking dogs at Petsmart just as I don't like cranky, crying kids at restaurants I go to.\u000a\u000aSo for me, this Petsmart is OK.  It's close to home but sometimes I just want to scream when I'm there and they're out of something or some dear little doggie is yipping its fool head off!

VOnce again, stock was limited--1 bag of what I wanted.  The staff had no idea if/when it would come in.  "We get three deliveries a week.  Try Sunday."\u000a\u000aI'll go to the Petsmart on Fort Apache and skip this place.  They have no clue.  The Fort Apache store is smaller yet is ALWAYS fully stocked.

VI'm not a big Hallmark shopper.  It's too easy top buy cards almost anywhere else.  That being said, I wanted to get a card for a friend and since Amy's Hallmark is near my home, I drove here and got the card.\u000a\u000aAmy's has a good selection and is a typical Hallmark store.  I regret the move by Hallmark to make so many cards with sound.  Just give me a good, old fashioned card with a  nice saying.  Or give me something humorous without the razzle dazzle.

VI was in the neighborhood and needed to go to an ATM.  This is one of the most inconvenient entrances I've seen of almost any bank.  You drive around the whole building to hopefully get a parking space in front.\u000a\u000aI walked right up to the ATM, so this place gets an OK rating--but just.

VI had a comp for brunch for two and a friend from Yelp and I went here yesterday.  WOW!  Talk about food overload!  And was it good!\u000a\u000aWe had reservations for noon and were seated immediately.  At that time, the place was fairly empty.  We chose to sit indoors--we're locals and it's still cold.  We let the tourists sit in the 50 degree weather outside.\u000a\u000aUpon being seated, we each got a starter dish of fresh fruit with strawberries, mango, watermelon, cantaloupe, and honeydew and a dish with two fruit empanadas.  The fresh fruit had a mango sauce.  The fruit was a nice starter.  We then ate the empanadas which were quite good, too!  Then began our slow but steady try of almost everything on their brunch menu.\u000a\u000aThe menu lists 18 brunch dishes.  They are all tapas size so you can try many different dishes.  You order two or three, enjoy them, and then order some more.  Here's what I got:\u000a\u000aGreen corn tamale - some wonderful sweet corn with sour cream and salsa fresca.  Behind the opened corn husk was a packet of sweet corn wrapped in another corn shuck and tied.  It was sweet and wonderful!\u000a\u000aHuevos rancheros - this was a tostada with a fried egg (you can have it cooked your way) with ranchero sauce, guacamole, salsa fresca and cotija cheese.  Another winner.\u000a\u000aBacon jalapeño PBJ - this is and interesting dish of fried egg, peanut butter, jelly, crispy bacon, and jalapeño all inside a fresh biscuit.  I couldn't taste the jalapeño but the bacon with the peanut butter and jelly was super!\u000a\u000aPeruvian shrimp and grits - a very nice, spicy sauced shrimp on top of grits.  The grits were thick, almost like mashed potatoes rather than the runny grits you normally get.  \u000a\u000aOaxacan pancakes - 3 small pancakes made with Mexican chocolate chips and served with a coffee caramel syrup.  Absolutely delightful!\u000a\u000aFrittata tart - a frittata made with baby spinach, caramelized leeks, and 3 cheeses - manchego, panela, and cotija.  \u000a\u000aNow for the dessert items:\u000a\u000aMexican rice pudding parfait - rice pudding with vanilla bean and seasonal fruit.\u000a\u000aBread pudding French toast - this was accompanied by caramelized banana and coconut syrup.  Very tasty!\u000a\u000aChurro tots - round churros filled with dulce de leche and rolled in cinnamon sugar with caramel and prickly pear dipping sauces with whipped cream.  A perfect ending to this feast!\u000a\u000aThe two of us spent 2 hours and 15 minutes enjoying this meal.  We chatted a lot, gossiped some (yes, guys do gossip), and we were never hurried.  Service was very good.  My coffee was refilled several times.  There were a couple of errors on orders where we got something we didn't order or we got two of everything.  It didn't matter.  We just kept and ate the extra goodies placed on our table.\u000a\u000aI plan to come back for lunch some afternoon when it's warmer and sit on the patio overlooking the Mandalay Bay pool.  This is a definite must return place!

VI went here for the first time yesterday (1/6/12) to get some papada and chutney.  The staff was very helpful in giving me suggestions about what flavors they had and where things were.\u000a\u000aAs others have noted, the store is very cluttered.  It seems like they have almost any Indian food product you could want.  There are non-food items, too.\u000a\u000aThis was my first foray in the India market but I'll be back to buy some curries and make my own dishes at home.

VDr. Doubrava is my eye care specialist.  He is an excellent physician.  I have been here for several yearly exams, and I stop in more often than I should because I'm always doing something to break, damage, or otherwise inhibit the lifespan of my glasses.  This is usually a hiking induced problem.  The office has a registered optometrist, Melissa, and she is top notch.  She has come to my rescue on many occasions.\u000a\u000aIn short, Dr. Doubrava's office is a one stop place for my eye care.  I appreciate him and the staff and will continue to stop here.

VI recently read a review on Yelp of the Cuba Cafe.  It's been a long time since I had good Cuban food, and I decided to give this place a try.\u000a\u000aI ordered the tasting plate to get an overall of their food.  The tasting plate consists of three meats--lechon asado, pollo tequilla, and ropa vieja.  The lechon was tender and juicy but I didn't get any of the garlic taste that the menu speaks of under that plate.  The pollo was very good and the sauce on it had a nice kick.  Far and away the best part of the plate was the ropa vieja.  This was juicy, tender, and very flavorful.  Along with the plate was a small salad and some rice and beans, the well known moros y cristianos.  There was a basked of cuban bread with the meal also.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I had the guava shells with cream cheese.  I had iced tea and it was refilled promptly.  Service was very friendly.  A man and a woman were covering the tables and they worked well in tandem.\u000a\u000aI really enjoyed Cuba Cafe and will be back with my wife.

VI had dinner here tonight and it was very good.  I started with complimentary papadam with two dipping sauces that were both quite good.  The main course was a fusion Mango Chicken made with fresh mango.  I had an order of garlic naan with the meal and a glass of delicious Mango Lassi.  I guess by now you can see the theme of my dinner tonight.\u000a\u000aAfter the main part was over, I had Kheer (Indian rice pudding) for dessert.  It was a small, whiskey shot glass sized dessert that was a perfect ending to the meal.\u000a\u000aI really enjoyed the place although when it's crowded, the seating might be a little close to your neighboring diners.\u000a\u000aFor out of towners who know the area, Mint is almost directly across Flamingo Road from the Atomic Testing Museum.

VI've been to Mint 8 times about half the time for lunch buffet and half for dinner.  Tonight, we stopped for dinner to try their new menu.  NOTE:  They have many new items on the menu and they continue to have their original items.\u000a\u000aThe first page of the new menu is the Inferno menu.  All dishes on this page are made with ghost peppers.  You have to sign a waiver before eating from this menu our server RS told us.  There's one challenge that if you finish, you get your photo on their Wall of Fame and you get a $50 Mint gift card for future use.  I don't think it's accepted by any hospitals.  (Michael K, this might be something you'd want to try!)\u000a\u000aIn addition, the new menu has soups and salads and appetizers of various kinds.  There are so many things to try it seems like a good UYE with 5 or 6 people to share the items.\u000a\u000aFor tonight, I chose the Vertical Vindaloo with lamb.  The menu change also allows you to order vindaloo and choose the protein you want--cheese, lamb, veggies, goat (bone in), swordfish, shrimp--and you choose your spiciness from 1 to 10.  I chose \u000a7 and I could have had more spice.  8 or 9 next time.  My wife ordered the Maharaja Tikka Masala with chicken breast (again choice of protein similar to the vindaloo).  She chose a spiciness of 3.  We also got an order of buttered garlic naan.\u000a\u000aEverything was excellent!  The vindaloo had good spicy flavor and the sauce was very flavorful.  There were cut potatoes in the sauce, too.  My wife enjoyed her dinner and she also expressed that it could be spicier.  Wow, are we going to 4 or 5 next time?  What happened to my gabacha?  The naan was the tastiest we've had here.  It wasn't quartered like other times but served in one large round that we tore apart.\u000a\u000aAfter dinner, she got khir and I pistachio kulfi.  I've had the khir before and while good, I wanted to try something different.  The pistachio ice cream was really, really good.  \u000aI asked RS if it was made in house or could I go to the Indian store and get it out of the freezer.  Sure enough, it's made in house.  There goes that idea for a repeat.\u000a\u000aRS was quite a pleasant server!  He refilled my iced tea when I was getting low and he gave us chance to look over the menu with no hurry and then was ready to answer any questions.\u000a\u000aI have a couple of other Indian restaurants to try, but for me, either for lunch buffet or dinner, Mint tops all the others.  It is very good!

VWe came to Wo Fat after our Doughnut Crawl near UNLV.  There were five and a half of us--one was a three year old who didn't eat all our goodies.\u000a\u000aNelson and Sylvia Q. had been here before, so they suggested some of the dishes that we ordered.  I can't say there was a loser in the bunch but I liked some better than others.\u000a\u000aThe spicy shrimp were good but they weren't spicy.  There were some jalapeño slices on top but there was no  spiciness to the shrimp themselves.  The crispy Gau gee was a winner!  What great flavor in that fried goodness.  We mixed the Chinese mustard with soy and dipped the Gau gee in that.  Great!  The pressed Almond duck was another winner.  I love duck and this was great!  The Kow yuk - pork belly - was very good and was not as sweet as the look of the sauce suggested.  Putting a thick slab of the pork belly in a bao and eating was very tasty.\u000a\u000aI think this little restaurant is a place to which I'll have to return.  Perhaps I can get my hiking group to stop here for lunch on the way back from one of our hikes this winter!

VThis is a review for this church as a concert venue only.\u000a\u000aI came here to see a concert called Oscar and Steve--songs whose lyrics were written by Oscar Hammerstein and Stephen Sondheim.\u000a\u000aThe church was a good venue for the show.  There aren't that many rows so everyone had a good view of the singers.  The church has seats rather than pews.  The only thing I looked for was an arm rest.  No.  The seats don't have them.\u000a\u000aI'd definitely come back here for another concert.  The parking is great and it's a short distance from the freeway.\u000a\u000aProps to the folks of the church for their sense of humor for naming their espresso bar HEbrews.  I thought that was catchy.

VI read the reviews of Casa Don Juan and decided to give it a go.  It's is good, and it certainly is fast!  I didn't think it would be as fast as it was, but once again, my fellow Yelpers were correct.  \u000a\u000aI had the carnitas con puerco.  It was a good sized plate of pork slices served with pico, guacamole, refried beans, and rice.  The carnitas were a bit dry, but I fixed that with some Tapatio and by spreading some salsa from the chips over the pork.  The food was good and I enjoyed my dinner here.\u000a\u000aThey served standard chips and salsa with bean dip.  The salsa had a bit of a zing to it, but the bean dip was blah.\u000a\u000aI'm not sure if I'd return.  This was a visit to try the place.  I'm not sure I'd drive to downtown when there are so many good choices nearer to home.

VWe went to Mundo tonight only to find it's not open on Mondays.  Duh to me for not checking hours in advance.  Plan B - go to Casa Don Juan.  We had two very enjoyable meals.\u000a\u000aMy gringa wife had a plain chicken breast with refried beans.  I had the chicken in mole.  Both were good.  My mole sauce was very flavorful.  It was rich with diverse elements that made it a complex and very tasty dish.\u000a\u000aWhile there, a nice gentleman played guitar and sang including Speedy Gonzales.  It was a good meal and a fun evening.\u000a\u000aI can't wait to go back to try the tongue tacos.

VI stopped here for breakfast yesterday and it was very good.  I ordered the Tropical French toast, two pieces of bread dipped in egg, coated with some toasted coconut and macadamia nuts, and nicely grilled.  \u000a\u000aI sat at the counter and the place was quite busy.  Maybe it just seemed that way because no one was eating outside because it was RAINING!  \u000a\u000aService was very quick and everyone was pleasant and had a nice smile.  I only had one cup of coffee but I was asked about a refill.  I was giving platelets later and I didn't want to be sitting the hour and a half in the chair when the coffee want to leave me.  Also, thanks to the restaurant for having a half order as an option.  That was just enough!\u000a\u000aOne thing that would really make this breakfast tropical would be to replace the maple syrup with coconut syrup.  Now that's tropical!

The staff is just as kind, caring, and compassionate as the other reviews have mentioned.\u000a\u000aI have been here before several years ago and I had the same caring staff work with me.  I highly recommend them.

VI've done a lot of business with this store.  Last night, my iPod died and I needed a replacement.  A short drive later, I walked into a redesigned store and didn't know where anything was.  Then I noticed large signs with names on them and I just looked around the store from where I was standing until I found the MP3 sign.\u000a\u000aI walked over, look at the iPods, talked to one of their young associates, and shortly left with a new one.  At first, the redo made me feel almost lost, because I was so used to the layout of the store before this.  It is light and roomy, and I like the way it looks.

VI bought a new iMac online and they automatically add Kaspersky protection unless you remove it from the order. \u000a\u000aI saw the remove button just as I was pressing the complete purchase button. They would not refund that portion because it's software. \u000a\u000aI called Customer Support and a supervisor there would not issue a refund. Policy is policy. So they're losing my business over a little thing. I have two words for Best Buy----Apple Store.

VI have been coming to this park for the 10 years I've lived near it.  I used to walk to the park but now it's part of my regular bike trip on Sunday mornings.\u000a\u000aThe park is divided into two sections--the walkway section with a children's play area  and the ball fields area.  The Summerlin website lists the walkway park as 4.6 acres of play area and walking trails and the ball field section as a 12.7 acre park.  Both sections have sidewalks.\u000a\u000aIt makes it convenient to be able to go under Town Center Drive to get to/from the park.  The traffic is heavy at times, and this makes a nice shortcut.  For walking or biking, the sidewalks go around the large bowl of the ball fields both at the bottom level or along the top rim.  There's a set of stairs and a ramp to get to the top rim near the Willows Community Center and pool on the north side of the ball field area.\u000a\u000aThis place is often busy with walkers getting their exercise, people walking their dogs, and parents watching their kids play.\u000a\u000aIt's a wonderful place with lots of room.

VThis is a bit larger than the common Starbuck's store.  They always have plenty of pastries, a large number of tables indoors, and there's a patio outside that they share with the Tropical Smoothies store.\u000a\u000aI have only been on the patio once.  There are enough pigeons to make any visit a painful stop unless you're into chasing them and trying to kick them in the ass.  But that fun grows tiresome quickly, so I just stay inside or take my coffee with me.

VI've stopped here for gas a few times, but since Costco is so close, there's really no need to pay their premium.  What I'm normally here for, as I was today, is to get the free papers--the Las Vegas Weekly, CityLife, and Vegas Seven magazines.  I like to read these, and I enjoy the print versions.\u000a\u000aStaff has always been friendly when they see me come for the free papers.  It looks like a well stocked convenience mart.

VI have been a member of AAA for over 40 years.  This office is the closest to where I live.  I agree with J.D.'s list of "I can't"s so I'm a member.\u000a\u000aI've been here for some tour books, but the reason I came today was to renew my car's registration for another year.  This office has a DMV kiosk.  I stopped and had the car smogged a few minutes before and then I drove to the AAA office.\u000a\u000aI scanned my renewal registration card, answered a few questions using the touch screen, and I left in about two minutes with my new plate sticker.  No online renewal, no waiting in the mail, just pure convenience.  That's 5 stars in my book any day!

VYesterday when laundry was being done, the washing machine was giving me fits.  It didn't want to do anything but agitate the clothes--no draining, no rinsing, no spinning.  After checking online for some possible fixes, I found a way around the problem that worked for the first load.  It didn't work for the second load.  Since the washer was recently repaired, I decided to replace it rather than keep pouring money down a bottomless pit.\u000a\u000aAfter a full morning including a reasonable wait at the DMV, I stopped and finally got my Starbucks. (sigh of relief!) As I entered RC Willey's, a woman asked me if she could help me.  I'm sure I had that male, deer in the headlights at a furniture/appliance store look.  I asked her if the coffee was OK and she answered, "Certainly!"  OK, three stars right there!\u000a\u000aShe directed me to the appliance area and within a few minutes, I bought a new washer and dryer, very similar to what we now have but 12 years newer and with a 5 year warranty.  They will be delivered Saturday.\u000a\u000aThe salesman, Jamie, was a pleasant enough fellow and I was on my way in no time at all.  This was a better than expected experience!\u000a\u000aMr. Buffet, you owe me another coffee just for putting some money Berkshire Hathaway's direction.  I won't hold my breath waiting for it!

VI needed to get some new dish towels and I decided to check here.  They had a fairly good selection but the prices were Triple B prices--too much.\u000a\u000aI walked around the store and looked at the other items they had.  You never know.  The store is about the same as it was when it first opened and I was getting things for our house.\u000a\u000aAfter a quick look around the store, I left and got some nice towels elsewhere at a reasonable price.\u000a\u000aI've always found the employees to be quite pleasant.

VI go to the Albertson's almost every day to get my Starbucks coffee.  There's no wifi, but I don't care.  I go for the faster service rather than wait at the standalone Bucky's nearer to Charleston.\u000a\u000aThe baristas at this Starbuck's are always very pleasant, lots of fun to chat with, and they remember my order.  How could they forget?\u000a\u000aIt's also a place where I have quiet time after the gym to savor my coffee and read the Los Angeles Times.  Ah, it makes my mornings!\u000a\u000aThis is also the Albertson's I usually go to for groceries.  A great bunch of folks in the entire store for the most part.

VThis is our local Chinese take out place.  I hadn't been here in quite awhile because I've been getting Archi's Thai instead.\u000a\u000aI got two large soups for us last night - one wonton and one hot and sour.  Both were well done.  Sometimes, the wonton can be a bit salty for my wife, but it was fine last night.  \u000a\u000aThe prices may be a bit higher compared to some other places, but the taste and the convenience seal the deal for me.  Service is always so quick that I never call ahead.

VI had the Southwest Chicken Salad for dinner tonight and it was quite good.  While they were working on the salad, I walked next door to Starbucks and got the dinner drink of champions and then took both home.  Now, that's what I call a two-fer.\u000a\u000aThe young woman who waited on me was quite pleasant and I felt it was a good choice for my dinner.

VThe Big O people at this store really do know tires.  They have always treated me well.  Above all, they have been honest about how much time a tire job would take.  I really appreciate knowing it will be 2 hours and not being told 1/2 hour only to wait and wait.  The two hour tire repair was the case today as they were very busy.  Knowing this, I left the tire with them and came back later to have it remounted and the spare returned to where it belongs.\u000a\u000aI can't say but good about this outlet.  They are very good at what they do!

VReview for casino only:\u000a\u000aThe renovations the Silverton made a few years back has expanded the casino and expanded the food and drink offerings.  The casino is more spacious and the layout of the machines is a very comfortable one.\u000a\u000aThe new garage has made parking very easy.  They even had the good thinking to put a slot ticket change machine near the exit where you get the elevators to the garage parking.\u000a\u000aI am a fan of the Silverton.

VReview for the casino only:\u000a\u000aThe casino floor has gotten a bit friendlier with the removal of some of their machines.  The layout now gives you more room, and they have placed several of their machines on 4 machine pedestals that give you lots of room and separation from fellow gamers.\u000a\u000aFYI, if you're going during NFL season, the cocktail waitresses are not dressed as nicely as they are during the rest of the year.  Instead of the great outfits they normally wear, they're free to wear team logo shirts  and other gear that tends to cover them up more.  Who cares if they like Team X?  I like the normal slinky looking cocktail outfits.  For that reason, I can't wait for football season to be over!

VWhat do three Yelpers do after a double hike at Mount Charleston?  We look for a place to refill our depleted nutritional content.  We first went to a restaurant that had a 35 minute wait.  We opted not to wait and started Yelping on our smart phones to find somewhere else.  On the way to a 2nd suggested place, Warren P. found Jamms and since it was nearby, I piloted the car to Jamms.  What a nice stop for idea #3.\u000a\u000aThe three of us started out with a free pot of bread, just for mentioning Yelp.  They have plain, cinnamon, and the flavor of the day was green chili and cheese which is what I got.  It comes with a cup of softened butter and was tasty.\u000a\u000aI had the S'mores pancake.  That's pancake batter with marshmallow and chocolate chips in the batter.  It's topped with some extra chocolate chips--for good measure-- that soften from the hot pancake.  There is also a drizzle of caramel sauce on the pancake.  I got the single pancale and it was a perfect ending to a great hike.\u000a\u000aService was excellent.  I'll be back here for sure!

VIt was a long time until I came back to this or any Vons and it will be a long time before I return.  Note to Vons:  when you put  an item in your sale circular, don't make it for the weekend only.  I stopped for their deal on Coke products, and when I got to register, I learned it was only through yesterday - a Super Bowl promotion.  Damn it all anyway, put it on sale for the whole week.\u000a\u000aI made my purchase at non-sale price and then left.  I went up Charleston to Smith's where I finished my shopping.  From now on, when the mailing comes, I'll just ignore the Vons.  It's just not worth it

VI stopped in to pick up a side salad to take home rather than make a salad from scratch.  The line at the drive through went very slowly.  I should have parked and walked in.\u000a\u000aThe salad was fresh and with my own dressing it made a great addition to my meal.\u000a\u000aThe only problem I have with this McDonald's is the ease of getting in and out.  It isn't easy.  because of the way it sits in Boca Park, the drive through is in the back and you need to watch traffic going to other stores in the next section.  It's not the most easy space.

VI agree completely with the previous reviewer.  This place is not too far to drive and service is always quite fast.  I went to a different place today but was unable to find where they advertised it to be.\u000a\u000aThen, I knew I should have just done what I've done for a few years.  I headed to Fort Apache, drove right in, and was on my way in about 5 minutes.\u000a\u000aThe registration process is done.

The door opened directly on the lighting aisle so I didn't have far to go.\u000a\u000aThe self checkout was a breeze and I was on my way in less than 5 minutes.  That's really good!

VI come to this AM PM for the Pit Stop car wash adjacent to the AM PM.  I've been here several times.  Today, my car was so damn dirty from driving 60+ miles on dirt roads in Death Valley, and it needed a good wash.  I had earned a free car wash put the previous visits, so today was a good day to cash the free one in.\u000a\u000aThis is a standard soft brush wash.  It's towel dried at the end and I pay to have the tires cleaned.  It wasn't very busy this morning, so the one guy drying the cars did a great job on everything!\u000a\u000aI'll return here often.

VI found Dr. Koppe after we moved here 10 years ago, and our kids have gone here for their physicals and shots ever since.  The practice has grown and there are now three veterinarians in the practice.\u000a\u000aI find that the staff is caring and the specialty of dealing only with cats is great!\u000a\u000aOur two long hairs were adopted from Dr. Koppe after they were abandoned here by someone who left them there for boarding and then abandoned them.

VWe had a Groupon that was about to expire so we went here last night before a play to have dinner.  I was here years and years ago after it first opened.  It was a breakfast stop on our bike ride.  I hadn't been back since, but I'm glad I came back.\u000a\u000aIt was Happy Hour and our server, Alyssa, told us that all the apps were $8.  Since we were having dinner, we passed on that.  I have driven by often and seen their sign of steak and lobster for $19 available 24/7.  I asked if with the Groupon I could still get the special.  The answer was yes.  My wife ordered the Mushroom risotto.  We didn't order sides because we were both going to get dessert.\u000a\u000aAlyssa brought the food in a short time and she came back to see if my steak was rare enough.   It wasn't, but not by much and not enough to make a fuss over.  She understood as she likes her beef cooked blue also.  My steak was served on a thick slice of white potato and some fried onions.  My wife's mushroom risotto had several stalks of asparagus on top.  Both dishes were excellent!\u000a\u000aOn to dessert.  Andrea chose the Chocolate royale and I got the lemon pudding cake.  Both were very good.  \u000a\u000aI'd most likely give Sedona a 3 star rating but Alyssa was such a good server, I've upped the rating to 4 stars.  The place is a bit pricey but I can't complain about the cost of my special.  The two desserts were more expensive than my steak and lobster.\u000a\u000aThis is a place to go to for their special or for Happy Hour.  I'll go back and I'll sit out on the patio.  I liked the vibe inside last night.

VI ended up in the northwest yesterday running some errands and decided to do some shopping nearby.  Before hitting the freeway, I stopped at this Starbucks for a quick drink.\u000a\u000aThere was only one car at the drive through.  I ordered my drink, waited a reasonable amount of time, and then was on my way.  The register critter was pleasant and the quad espresso was Starbucks to the core.\u000a\u000aThe place is OK, but I'm not here very often.  It's also one of the most inconvenient places to get in and out.  I think that of the entire Centennial Center.

VI've stopped here a few times, but it's a long distance from where I live.  There were several items not in stock.  Perhaps they sold a lot over the weekend, but it didn't look like they had enough shelf space.  I really have to say the store had less stock than the two I'm accustomed to.  I won't be eager to return.

V*** Review is for casino only ***\u000a\u000aThe Stratosphere casino is a fairly large area that meanders from the self park garage around to Las Vegas Boulevard.  There are little tricks to remember where you want to go and which set of stairs/escalators are the best for getting to the theatre.\u000a\u000aThe casino itself has a good selection of various slots and denominations.  They seem to target the lower rollers like me.  The casino seems to be a lot cleaner than it was when I've been there in the past.  The cocktail waitresses were around often last night and were very pleasant women.  I did notice the large percent of people who were smoking but unless you were right near them, smoke was not a problem.  They've installed a good ventilation system.\u000a\u000aI'll always have fond thoughts about the Strat even though I'm not there very often.  It was here when I was invited to a free slot tournament that through some twist of fate, I came in first and won the grand prize of $10,000.  That still doesn't buy the place an extra star but it brings warm fuzzy thoughts!

VI've walked by Red Square for years and always wanted to give it a try.  Last night before the Lionel Richie concert was the perfect time.\u000a\u000aMy server was Mary and she saw to it that I got my iced tea quickly and she gave me plenty of time to look over the menu and then answer some questions.  For an appetizer, I got the Siberian nachos.  This is a fun way of doing nachos in a different manner.  There are five, very thinly sliced,waffle potato chips each with a nice slice of very good smoked salmon.  Topping each is a small dollop of caviar and sour cream.  The potato slices are so delicate, you can't pick up the chip and eat it with the salmon on top.\u000a\u000aThe main course had to be beef stroganoff.  This was made differently than I've ever had before but it was no less good.  In fact, this was the star of the meal and I recommend anyone eating here try the stroganoff.  It's a braised short rib that was extremely tender accompanied by wild mushroom tagliatelle.  There is some truffle flavored ricotta placed between the pasta and the beef.  Unlike what we normally think of stroganoff, this one was not heavy on sour cream to make a gravy for the beef.  Rather, the ricotta simply becomes blended a bit with the very good juices from the meat.  I like their way of doing stroganoff.\u000a\u000aI took Mary's advice for dessert--it's actually what I was going to order anyway.  This was good but was a bit of a disappointment.  The strawberry baked Alaska wasn't made nor served like a traditional baked Alaska which could have been OK except for one thing.  The base was a thin sponge cake with some fresh strawberry slices.  This was topped with some strawberry ice cream, and then the whole thing was mounded--not with meringue--but with marshmallow fluff that had been browned.  When I put my spoon to what I thought was meringue I learned by the very thick consistency how wrong I was.  The marshmallow was overwhelming in texture and in sweetness!  I was glad to get below to the strawberry ice cream to offset some of the cloying sweetness.\u000a\u000aService during dinner was excellent and Mary was a very pleasant server who made the dinner pleasant.  The runners made sure my iced tea was refilled as soon as I finished my glass.\u000a\u000aI like the room with it's Soviet themes.  This starts with the beheaded statue of Vladimir I. Lenin at the entrance.  The head was cut off and is in a freezer in the vodka tasting lounge where you get bottle service.  Above the door inside is CCCP for the Soviet Union and there's a hammer and sickle vodka vault sign by the bar and I could see part of the one mural in the bar/lounge area about a delegate--that's all I could read of the Russian letters.  While passing time between courses, I did notice that on the wall above the side of the bar, they have misspelled the Russian word for Square in their Red Square.  Perhaps it's the teacher in me and maybe it was my tough Russian professor in undergraduate school. \u000a\u000aFinally, the restaurant is very vibrant--sound wise.  I wouldn't plan on having a quiet conversation with your table mate.

VReview is for Spring Restaurant Week 2012 menu:\u000a\u000aThis three course meal was very good.  The restaurant is beautifully appointed and the service is absolutely top notch.  Everything is done well!\u000a\u000aFirst off was an amuse-bouche of ahi tuna with crispy wonton.  Delightful.\u000a\u000aCourse 1:  Salt and pepper shrimp.  Three large prawns, wok fried, with garlic and sauce and served in three lettuce cups.  Very tasty.\u000a\u000aCourse 2:  I opted for the wok fried prime filet of beef with pepper sauce.  The meat was very tender and flavorful.  Served with the main course was some baby bok choy and a little oval of sweet potato and a small bowl of steamed rice.\u000a\u000aCourse 3:  Honeydew melon tapioca.  This is coconut tapioca infused with honeydew and served with an oval of mango sorbet.  This was a very refreshing dessert.  It was very light and very tasty and an exceptional way to end the meal.\u000a\u000aKathy, my server, was top notch.  I watched as she rolled the pancakes for a whole Peking Duck and she was a master.  You certainly can't beat having the Fountains of Bellagio right outside your window.  Several of the servers wore gloves.  Everything was great!

V*** Review is for Spring 2013 Restaurant Week Menu ***\u000a\u000aThis is one of those places that I never think of going to because it's a bit of a pain for a local.  Park in the garage, walk in through the Star Lane Shops, go through the casino to the Studio Walk shops and there you'll find Emeril's New Orleans Fish House.  Well, I found out it's worth the pain.  I had a show at the Venetian at 8 PM, so I made a reservation with Open Table for 5:30 and I was seated immediately.\u000a\u000aThen began service that was equal to some of the finest restaurants at which I've eaten in this  town.  One of three people was always aware, in an unobtrusive way, where I was with any of the courses.  Within seconds of finishing a course, someone was there to ask if they could remove the dish.  When my iced tea was almost finished, a new glass was brought and replaced the old one without having to ask.  And, Emeril's passed my pink packet test with an A+ grade!  I began this review with the service first because I wanted it to be the stand out it was.\u000a\u000aFor the first course, I chose the Caesar salad with romaine hearts, parmesan cheese, roasted garlic grissini and a creamy house dressing.  Most of the description comes from the menu.  The dressing and shredded parmesan were outstanding.\u000a\u000aFor course two, I had to go with the gumbo.  After all, Emeril's New Orleans Fish House, isn't it a law you have to try the gumbo.  It was a mixture of shrimp, chicken and Andouille pork suasage with okra and rice.  The gumbo had the proper thickness and it was peppery spicy, not hot sauce spicy.  it was very good.\u000a\u000aFor the main course, I went with the sweet barbecued Atlantic salmon.  My waiter said the chef suggested medium rare cooking.  I told him it could be closer to rare and that's just the way it was.  As the menu states, accompanying the salmon were "spicy Andouille pork sausage hash, crystal fried onion crust And Emeril's house made Worcestershire."  There were pieces of Andouille, cubed potatoes, and some fresh tomatoes.  The salmon was excellent and the barbecue cooking gave me the chance to try salmon prepared in a different manner.\u000a\u000aTo end this dinner, I chose an item not on their online RW Week menu but is on their normal menu.  It's the flourless bourbon chocolate cake with sweet cherry compote and peanut butter mousse.  What a combination!  Delicious chocolate cake with some peanut butter mousse and some cherries.  One forkful was a blast of different flavors.  This is a winner.  There were also some chopped, glazed nuts for texture.\u000a\u000aThis was an excellent beginning to my Restaurant Week. \u000a\u000aNote to M Life members.  If you take your receipt to the M Life club, they'll give you M Life points for the value of your dinner but you can't get it directly from Emeril's.

VI met an out of town friend here for dinner before the Michael Jackson One show.  I've been wanting to try the Burger Bar and it was convenient for having dinner and getting to the 7 o'clock show.\u000a\u000aI had read reviews of friends on Yelp and had decided what I was going to get before I got there.  Then I looked at the menu there and I changed my mind.  While we were studying the menu, our server brought our drinks and he kept my iced tea refilled during the meal.\u000a\u000aI opted for the Hubert Keller burger which is ground buffalo meat.  It's topped with caramelized onions, bleu cheese, and baby spinach served on a ciabatta bun.  Finally, it's served with a red wine and shallot sauce which the menu states is Keller's favorite sauce.  I ordered the burger rare.  The server asked if I wanted it cool inside and yes was my answer.  \u000a\u000aIt was served exactly the way I wanted it--red, cool meat.  The burger was very tasty and very juicy.  It was better buffalo than I've had in the past.  I also got a side of skinny fries which were good but nothing special.  It was also a small amount for the price.  As for Chef Keller's favorite sauce, I didn't find it all that flavorful.  I poured some on the burger and some on the bun but I got no flavor of cooked wine and shallots.\u000a\u000aThis is a good burger joint.  The place was crowded and noisy when we got there, but the crowd thinned out as we were there.  I guess I know how to clear a room.  I'd like to try his foie burger.  Had I known that when I went to the casino before the show I'd hit a $120 bonus, I'd have gotten the foie burger.  Oh well, another time.

VI saw Penn &  Teller last night for the 5th time and I thought it was the best show I've seen them do!  The show moved smoothly from one illusion to another and Penn has learned how to limit his narration so he doesn't talk too much.\u000a\u000aThere are a few of the old favorites--the concluding gun trick, Teller's flower routine, and the "mind reading" part.  There are several new illusions and I was glad to see them.  This is what I like about these two guys.  They always do different things so the show is a combination of older favorites and newer illusions.\u000a\u000aAnd, if you go now, you get a chance to hear Teller speak--sort of--but then I guess you'll have to go and see the show for yourself!  These guys are good.\u000a\u000aA final note, my ticket was a comp from the two.  Each year in December, they give United Blood Services a card to give to blood donors for two free tickets to their show.  They support Las Vegas and it's appreciated!

VReview is for Spring 2012 Restaurant Week dinner:\u000a\u000aI've been waiting awhile to try Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill and Restaurant Week seemed like the time to do it.  The appetizer and main course are on the regular menu.  Dessert is not listed on their website menu so this was a good sampler of the real thing at Mesa Grill.\u000a\u000aOn being seated, I was given the regular menu, a wine and cocktail menu, and the Restaurant Week menu.  My server, Rodil, was great with ordering and everything thereafter.  I ordered an iced tea and it was brought quickly followed by bread basket with a nice selection--two slices of jalapeño bread with a nice kick, a corn muffin, and two slices of raisin bread.  Accompanying the bread was softened butter.  I also tried the corn muffin.  It was good but a little dry.  The best thing about the muffin was the number of corn bits baked into it.  Still the jalapeño bread was my favorite.\u000a\u000aFor the first course, I ordered the blue corn pancake.  It was filled with duck and had a habanero chile-star anise sauce.  Rodil had alerted me that this wasn't spicy, but for a starter, I didn't care.\u000a\u000aThe second course was Flay's signature dish, New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with a bourbon-ancho chile sauce and a sweet potato tamal which had a round of crushed pecan butter placed into the sweet potato/corn mixture to add liquid.  The pork was tender and cooked perfectly.  The spices rubbed on the pork gave it some great flavor and zing, and the ancho chile sauce was excellent--dark, rich, and very flavorful.  Rodil noticed that I was almost snorting the sauce and he asked if I wanted more, the pusher.  He brought a small round dish with extra ancho sauce.  I dipped my tenderloin in the sauce with abandon and joy!  The tamal was superb.  What an interesting twist on the common tamal.\u000a\u000aMy choice for dessert was Chocolate Bread Pudding with toasted bourbon marshmallow squares and graham cracker crisps on top.  The chocolate was semi-sweet and this was a fine ending to the meal.  It wasn't as sweet as most desserts and it complimented the flavors from the pork.\u000a\u000aI had the best seat in the house in my mind.  I was near the back of the restaurant seated along a railing where I could watch the chefs do their work.  I had a good view of the grill where the steaks were cooked, and I could see into the salad/dessert preparation area.  Right near me was the staging area where two people oversaw the distribution of food.  When an order came in, they each got a copy and they both checked to see things were correct.  The person working on the outside nearest me wiped the dishes to remove any stray food so presentation was perfect.\u000a\u000aI enjoyed the meal.  I was not hurried but things moved along at a good pace.  All the staff was efficient and pleasant.  This was a great meal to kick off the Spring 2012 Restaurant Week and I will be back!

VFor the casino only:\u000a\u000aNice enough casino especially because they have a section that is non-smoking.  It's great not having to fight the wasps of smoke coming from different directions.\u000a\u000aThe casino is huge and there are machines and table games for anyone.  Drink service is prompt.

VCasino review only:  The Palms is a good place for VP.  I went there today to puck up a free hoodie they were giving away.  I fit the profile of the player the Palms wants.  An older local who plays in the daylight hours, doesn't embarrass himself by using the pool, and then goes home before it gets dark do the young, beautiful people can take over.\u000a\u000aIt's a hip kind of place.  I did go to the Playboy Club and casino once.  The view from up there is stunning!\u000a\u000aAs long as they keep giving freebies that are worthwhile, I'll come back.  Oh yes, and I'll be back for Garduños, too!

VReview is for casino only:\u000a\u000aIt's been awhile since I've been in New York New York.  I went today to pick up a ticket for Zumanity and I was reminded about the convoluted walk from the garage to the theatre.  I wish I had remembered the two short cuts which would have made my trek more pleasant.  Having said that, it was fun to see the tourist in its grazing area.  In fact, some were just standing there acting like they had a laser sight aimed at them and they were frozen in position.  Get out of my way, you dolt!\u000a\u000aI made it to the theatre without too much difficulty but then I waited.  They were understaffed and they also had a customer who needed to make a phone call to find out about a lost reservation booked through her airline.  That kept that agent from helping others for awhile until the agent handed the phone through the bars and let the woman talk directly to the people with whom she had to get the problem resolved.\u000a\u000aTen minutes later, the woman is still on the phone and I make it to the window where she is.  The NY NY rep was a pure delight.  She found the ticket in the system with my confirmation number and she had me on my way in less than two minutes.  And, I took the shortcut back to the garage.\u000a\u000aAs for the casino and the areas in it, I always liked the vibe of this casino.  The New York theme, the restaurants, the food court--it all goes into making this place OK in my book in spite of the tourists (we have to love them--they pay so much in taxes)!\u000a\u000aI'll be back in August for Zumanity.

VReview for casino and showrooms only:  The Hilton is a classy, old school Las Vegas place.  There's something special when you walk in and see all that gaudy crystal and mirrors.  \u000a\u000aThe Hilton recently shuffled the layout of their machines, and they moved my favorite Spin Poker machines from the front where I could watch the pretty ladies coming by to an area that's pushed together and without much people watching possibilities.  -1 star for that.  \u000a\u000aThe Shimmer Showroom and the Hilton theatre are good venues.  The large theatre could really use a refurbishing.  The seats are years and years old and they look and feel their age.  There are some good shows at the two venues and parking is easy.

VI have to up my review of the LVH by one star because they have moved the statue of Elvis back into the entrance of the hotel/casino near where it used to be for years before they moved it outside.  I always enjoy watching tourists and now it's a bit easier with the statue in casino entrance.\u000a\u000aI hope the move was not for the month of August when there's a lot of Elvis interest because of his death in August.  The statue deserves to be in the LVH where he performed so many times.\u000a\u000aElvis hasn't left the building!

VReview for casino only:\u000a\u000aI have always enjoyed the Monte Carlo although it seems like it could use an interior facelift.  I like the newer garage, but the walk from there to the casino is a long one.\u000a\u000aCocktail service was excellent last night.  She was around probably 5 times in 45 minutes and she asked each time she came back.

VI've seen Zumanity twice and I enjoyed it both times.  I would describe it as a sensuous show, not a sexy one.\u000a\u000aIt's not a traditional Cirque show, but then, Cirque is breaking the mold with their newer shows, so there is less of a traditional show now unless you go back to the original Strip production of Mystère.\u000a\u000aThe outfits, gymnastics, and dancing in Zumanity make it very inviting.  There are also some very funny parts that break up the more serious acts.\u000a\u000aDon't be shy and avoid Zumantiy.  Give it a whirl.

VReview is for casino only:  This place is OK.  It's a bit spread out, but it's easy to navigate when you know it's little quirks.  They did move my favorite VP machines but a check with one of the floor people let me know where they are.\u000a\u000aThe audio playing last night--notice I didn't use the word music--was simply awful.  Whoever programmed this must have been high or nuts or both.\u000a\u000aNot a bad place to play on the Strip.

VI have stayed at the Mirage once several years ago, so this review will be for the casino.  I enjoy coming to the Mirage.  From the moment I see the fish tanks behind check in and the  atrium, I feel good to be there.\u000a\u000aThe casino is not the friendliest to navigate when you're heading to the back to the Terry Fator Theatre, but after being there many times, there are short cuts to avoid the people who are slow, gawking, tipsy or a combination of those things.\u000a\u000aIt's a short walk outside to the volcano and once you're in the back, you can visit the Secret Garden of Siegfried and Roy or you can just watch the people at the pools nearest that area.

VThis ranks with the best steakhouse dinners I've had in Las Vegas.  We came here before the Elton John concert last night.  I ordered a New York strip (a 12 ounce steak) and my wife got the 9 ounce filet.  We got an order of fries as a shared side.\u000a\u000aThe bread basket had a nice variety but I didn't want to fill up on that so I had two small slices of two kinds.  The steaks were both cooked perfectly.  Mine, blue, was cool and red on the inside--just perfect!  The fries were nicely seasoned although I didn't taste much garlic as I had expected.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, my wife had the seasonal berries and I went with the single size portion of carrot cake.  I would like to see the double portion for sharing just to see if it needs two people to carry it to the table.\u000a\u000aService was excellent!  Lopez was our server and he was very personable, polite, and efficient.  I never asked for an iced tea refill.  It was automatic.  Next time, we'll sit on the patio and watch the people walking by in the Forum Shops. We found that the air conditioning inside was quite cold and it was a bit warmer on the patio.

VReview for casino only:\u000a\u000aThe MGM Grand is huge with enough variety of machines and table games to please almost anyone.  There are several bars throughout and many restaurants.  \u000a\u000aDespite the huge size, there are no nooks or areas where you can be basically alone unless you go at an off time.  At night, the casino is often quite crowded despite its huge size.  \u000a\u000aStill, I find the place A-OK.

VReview for casino only:\u000a\u000aIt's been a couple of years since I was in the TI Casino except to go to a show at the Mystère Theatre which means you aren't really in the casino area.  Making my way through when I went to Isla, I noted that the carpet needs replacing.  The place doesn't have quite the smart look it had a few years ago before MGM starting letting it become a 3rd tier hotel and before it was sold to Phil Ruffin.\u000a\u000aThis wouldn't be one of my choices for a casino if I were to gamble on the Strip.

VReview is for casino only:\u000a\u000aPart of my 2 star rating is for the damn parking garage.  It has to be one of the dumbest designs I've ever seen.  Also, because the property was built cheaply vis à vis the drainage, anytime we have a good rain means there's flooding behind the IP because the water rushes through the garage and the small channel behind can't take all the water.\u000a\u000aThe casino is OK, but there certainly are better places in any direction from here except west.  The machines are mostly penny slots these days and the place is a mess with the construction now taking place.\u000a\u000aAfter Project Linq is finished, I'll have to come see how different the IP is.  Until then, unless I'm going to a show upstairs, I'll steer clear of the IP.

VI was here for the second time tonight and it was a very good evening.  We had the option to do the patio, but chose instead to eat in the open air area under the front roof but not on the outside patio itself because of the bright late afternoon sunshine.\u000a\u000aThere were four of us.  Two got steaks with different sauces--one bordelaise and mine the roquefort.  The other main courses were the crab cake and the herb grilled chicken breast.  Two shared a side of macaroni and cheese and two shared the garlic spinach.\u000a\u000aThe steaks for both of us were done perfectly just as we ordered.  The pommes frites were excellent.  The spinach and mac and cheese were both great!  We had an extremely pleasant dinner.  It was a fine evening with my wife and two good friends from the east.\u000a\u000aOf course the view of the Bellagio fountains across the street was very good.  This time I didn't notice Mon Ami silence their music so you could hear the fountain music.  Also, the restaurant was quite noisy.  Part of that was street noise.  I deduct a half point for that and although our server was basically good, a half point for forgetting to bring the iced teas until reminded 5 minutes later and for a general attitude that just seemed to rub me the wrong way.\u000a\u000aWhat better way to spend two hours on a summer evening than dining with 2 good friends, enjoying good conversation and have a very good meal!  I really like Mon Ami Gabi!\u000a\u000aA bientôt!

VWe had a Travelzoo voucher for a 3 course dinner for two people that was about to expire, so I made reservations.  I was looking forward to André's for some time because of his tremendous reputation in Las Vegas.\u000a\u000aWe were seated in the small room where the elevator comes from the first floor.  At first I thought we had been placed in steerage, and perhaps we were, because everyone in our room had the Travelzoo voucher.  Our server told us there are a lot used at the very beginning and a lot at the end of an offer.  She also told us to keep an eye out because they were soon going to have another one because the summer months are the slowest for fine dining restaurants.\u000a\u000aWe were given the Travelzoo menu and made our choices.  Shortly, a waiter brought us an amuse-bouche of a thin slice of jicama topped by a thin slice of sea bass and some small rounds of red pepper.  It was tasty and the pepper slices gave it a small amount of zing.  Shortly after the amuse, a waiter brought some warm baguette slices.\u000a\u000aFor our appetizers, my wife ordered the Caesar salad and I got the lobster bisque.  Her salad was very good and quite large.  My lobster bisque was OK.  If you look at my photos, that's not lobster in my bisque.  There were very few pieces of lobster.  The menu describes the dish as lobster and corn stuffed sweet pepper.  The dish was OK.\u000a\u000aMy main course was the duck breast and duck sausage and my wife got the chicken breast.  The duck was cooked very well but the hit of this dish was the duck sausage.  Excellent!  My wife's chicken was nothing special.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, we each got the chocolate soufflé and that was also very good.  Service was good.  Note, when using a Travelzoo voucher, they add 18% gratuity (large party rate) to your check.  \u000a\u000aI guess my lasting impression of André's was how little impressed I was by it.  It's an oddly shaped place.  Both dining rooms upstairs are small, and it's somewhat disconcerting to sit in a room where an elevator brings people in and past your table less than a few feet away.  I do think the inner room was saved for regular customers a.k.a. non-Travelzoo people.  I will give a big hand to our server who directed a jerk who came out of the cognac and cigar room while puffing away on his cigar.  \u000a\u000aI'm glad I ate at André's once, but this is not a place to which I'll return.  There are way too many good choices in this town.

VThis review is for the theatre only:\u000a\u000aI came here last night for a benefit performance of Rick Thomas and Esteban for the Make A Wish Foundation.  The stage is quite large which makes a large production very easy here.  While neither Thomas nor Esteban have such a large production, they make the space work.  \u000a\u000aThe theatre itself is wide but there aren't many rows.  Unless you sit in the balcony, which is generally closed off, you'll have a good view wherever you sit.  My seat was in the first row, stage right, and I had an excellent seat even though I was off to one side of the stage.  No one was in front of me and I could stretch out without worrying about my feet.

VI haven't been to the Peppermill in 20 years.  We stopped there a few times when we were tourists.  I decided to go today for a different breakfast place.\u000a\u000aI arrived about 9:45 and the place was packed.  There was a waiting list for a table, but the counter was open so I went there.  Angela was my server and she immediately got me some coffee.  I have read about the big portions.  It starts with their over-sized coffee mugs.  Very nice.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Fruit fantasia waffle, a good sized waffle topped with seasonal fresh fruit and served with boysenberry syrup and butter and whipped cream or sour cream for a topping.  The waffle had a lot of fruit--bananas, grapes, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, and strawberries.  It was excellent.\u000a\u000aThis is an institution that has been around for a lot of years and based on the people there today, it will be around for a lot more.

VFor the casino only:\u000a\u000aIt's a pleasant enough place.  Sometimes it can get quite noisy and the music is loud.  On the other hand, they do have Spin Poker Deluxe which is the VP I like to play.\u000a\u000aIt's not the easiest place for locals to go when compared to the easy in and out of the newer places, but when you're going to see Vinnie Favorito or X Burlesque, you come in the back way to the garage and make do.

VReview for casino and Atrium level only:\u000a\u000aI've been to the Luxor many times for shows.  Today I stopped by for the Bodies and Titanic exhibitions on the Atrium level.\u000a\u000aIt's easy to get here from the garage.  The area is clean and easy to navigate, and having a food court nearby might be good for some.\u000a\u000aThe casino is OK.  They have changed it so much as they've added nightclubs and marketed this property to the younger set.  Still, it's an OK place.

VI've been to the museum many times.  The reason for today's visit was to see the final show by Rag Tag Entertainment in the Cabaret Showroom.\u000a\u000aIt was a superb afternoon show with many of the folks from Strip shows from Jersey Boys, Phantom, and Love to name a few.\u000a\u000aIt's sad the museum and the cabaret will be closing on October 17th.

VReview is for casino only:\u000a\u000aI stopped here today to get tickets for the Lion King for when a freind is in town.  I really like this casino.  I have always liked the aroma they pump into the air.  When I walk in from self-park and see the headless statue of Lenin, I can't help but smile and know I'm at the Mandalay.\u000a\u000aWhen I've been here for other shows, cocktail service in the casino has been prompt and friendly.

VI went to the Four Seasons today to see their Christmas gingerbread house display.  I most likely will never stay here so I took the opportunity to check our Charlie Palmer's Steakhouse menu, the Verandah menu, and to take a tour of the pool area and the hotel lobby. Since it's not pool weather, there's no problem getting out to see the pool.\u000a\u000aThe hotel is stunning.  You can see the attention to detail in almost everything they do.  I was not going the right way when I entered the hotel from Mandalay Bay.  I asked an employee and he told me how to get downstairs to the lobby to see the display.\u000a\u000aThis is a nice excuse, if one ever needed one, to go check out the Four Seasons and see it.

VThis review is for their Restaurant Week 2011 menu:\u000a\u000aPink Taco has only one meal for RW 2011 - breakfast.  It's a three course meal.  The food was good - nothing special, the service was great, the timing of the courses was awful (I don't believe it was the server's fault.)\u000a\u000aA three course breakfast should be like any multi-course meal--brought out as individual plates at appropriate intervals.  This was not the case at the Pink Taco for their RW breakfast.\u000a\u000aThe first course was a hand made breakfast parfait - coconut granola with yogurt and fresh berries.  It came in a good sized bowl with a good amount of fresh fruit including mango bits, raspberries, blackberries, and kiwi.  I don't believe the granola was coconut granola.  Rather, there were slivers of fresh coconut on top the parfait.  This was quite tasty but nothing exceptional.  The problem came as I was eating the breakfast parfait.  I had eaten about 1/3 of the parfait, when a different server brought me course two - the hot foods of the breakfast sampler.\u000a\u000aCourse two - a breakfast sampler.  Their RW 2011 menu describes it like this:  Mexican Breakfast Trio - Tasting portions of Huevos Rancheros, Chilaquiles, and Grilled Carne with House made Tortillas and Pappas y Chorizos.  Now I had a large parfait, partially eaten and a large plate of Mexican breakfast tastes.  (See the photo here which shows the parfait off to one side to make room for another plate of food.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/d4qwVw4PcN-_2mK2o1Ro1g?select=tjU_kv_9kwnv8hF2rpcUgQ )  The sampler was tasty especially the chilaquiles.  The carne was just OK.  I really liked the huevos rancheros.\u000a\u000aNext service problem - as I was about 3 minutes into course two, the original server brought out course 3 which consisted of 4 sopapillas with a strawberry compote.  Another warm dish that needed to sit until I could get to it.\u000a\u000aAs for course three, the sopapillas were good.  I didn't taste any honey in the fruit compote as the RW menu stated, but the pillow was just warm and the strawberry was OK.  I ate one sopapilla only.\u000a\u000aThoughts:  someone at Pink Taco needs to give some thought to this menu.  It's way TOO much food for one person.  For the food I got, the price of $20.11 was quite a bargain.  However, since I sent back a good portion of it rather than pig out, it really wasn't a bargain.  And, someone at Pink Taco needs to think out the way they deliver a multi-course meal like this.  If they do this breakfast menu again, I'll bring a friend or three, and we'll split the food and all will be satisfied.  My server, Paulina, was a very pleasant woman.  She refilled my coffee when it needed.\u000a\u000aSitting on the patio was quite nice especially since I was the only person there.  However, they really shouldn't offer patio seating when they're landscapers working on the grounds and using loud and smelly leaf blowers.  It didn't last long, and I did enjoy sitting out and watching some pool critters go by with their bikinis.  Oh to be young again!\u000a\u000aThis was one of the hardest reviews to write.  Overall I enjoyed my meal, the surroundings, and Paulina.  But, someone at Pink Taco needs to rethink their menu.  A cup of granola, smaller tasting portions, one, maybe two sopapillas and I'd have been a happy camper all around!

VOK, one more review for Bouchon for breakfast.  It was fantastic.  Our group of five enjoyed the various dishes, service was simply superb, and the atmosphere was quite good. I want to go back and try something else.\u000a\u000aWe had breakfast here on 16 November 2009.

VWhat could be better than having brunch at Bouchon with an old friend and two new friends?  We ordered:  2 orders of sourdough waffles, one chicken and waffles, one Bouchon French toast, one pommes frites to share, and one cheese Danish to share.\u000a\u000aThe food was excellent.  I really have had few sweets to compare with that cheese Danish.  Stunning!  Everyone liked what they ordered, and the pommes frites were wonderful.  The only thing that compares to these are those at an unnamed --well, OK, they have arches.  Enough said.\u000a\u000aI took one star away becasue we who got the waffles didn't get the toasted walnuts that are standard with the dish. Since we were deep in conversation, we didn't notice until it was too late.  They should know better, however.\u000a\u000aBefore I left the Venetian, I checked the Bouchon Bakery near the Phantom Theatre, and they sell the cheese Danish.  Halleluia.  next time, one of you will be mine!  \u000a\u000aNo photos this time.  There are hundreds already here.

VI give this place 4.5 stars.  This was the first time I've been here for dinner.  The other two times were to have breakfast.  I looked at the menu online before I went, and I was pretty certain what I'd get but I wanted to see any specials they might have.\u000a\u000aSoup:  I got the Spinach potage, the name on the specials board.  My waiter described it as a potato leek soup with emulsified with spinach.  It had a goat cheese mousse on top with some Niçoise olive oil.  Very tasty soup.\u000a\u000aMain course: Steak frites.  Cooked rare as ordered and tons of french fries.  This is very characteristic of any Bouchon meal with frites.  At some point, you have to decide whether you want to finish all of those tasty critters or save some room for dessert and just let them go.  That's what I opted to do.\u000a\u000aDessert:  The desserg special tonight was Neopolitan French macaron ice cream sandwiches one of each of the traditional Neopolitan flavors.  They're the standard macarons you can buy in the Bouchon Bakery downstairs but they were filled with ice cream rather than the cream the macarons normally have.  These were outstanding.\u000a\u000aI really like coming to Bouchon.  I like the room, the nice view to the 10th floor courtyard, and the food is quit interesting.  My server was Brandon, and he was excellent!  The bus person was there to refill my iced tea, and when he noticed there wasn't enough ice, he brought me a new glass of ice, filled it with tea, and took the other glass away.  Really outstanding service.  \u000a\u000aIt's no wonder that when I have a friend text me that he's going to Bouchon for breakfast and asks, "Do you want to meet me there?" that I send a Yes answer back quickly.\u000a\u000aHere are the links to the photos of tonights repast.\u000a\u000a\u000aSpinach potage:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A?select=pgpbWHklxCYh2BqhFbzY6Q\u000a\u000aButter cup, bread, and dish of pistachios:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A?select=2GpdTnZLS1ERZkIEo8aA8w\u000a\u000aSteak frites:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A?select=UPsLa1GuEymVl0bmHu0uSw\u000a\u000aNeopoliatan French Macaron ice cream sandwiches \u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A?select=4FQvAgqPM5ArZelwZpSiSg\u000a\u000aIced Tea and carafe:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A?select=zpxcTWEoBQuXsoMlsXJq5w\u000a\u000aNapkin with menu:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A?select=FN8sFAnuP3Lt2sLxrBu7Vg\u000a\u000aSpecials board:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A?select=JrLU1pWJcwv8wnUOupJK-g

VI came to Bouchon last night for their Bastille Day special menu.  It was a grand meal.  I was brought their pain d'epi with some butter and the small bowl of pistachios.  I love this bread and I have to take care I don't overdo it.\u000a\u000aMy server was Amy and she was a gem!!  I asked her about the size of the Bastille Day menu dishes and she explained they were all appetizer size.  I ordered a half dozen oysters, an order of pommes frites aux truffes, and The Saucisson platter.  \u000a\u000aThe oysters came 2 each of three different areas from which they were harvested.  Next up was the sausage assortment that came on a board.  There was one horizontally sliced piece of their bratwurst on a small bed of sauerkraut, 2 rounds of Merguez, a slice of garlic sausage en croute, and one link of their boudin blanc.  The sausages were accompanied by some whole grain mustard, some yellow mustard, a couple of cornichons, and some pickled onion slices and other small vegetables pieces.  With the platter, I was brought more bread (3 kinds), and then came the pommes frites.\u000a\u000aIt was a feast.  The sausages were all very good.  It would be a fantastic platter to serve any day but this is special for Bastille Day.\u000a\u000aAfter this, I ordered Chocolate Bouchons for dessert.  These were one of their dessert specials for the night.  I didn't see macarons as was stated online when I read about their special menu for the day.  The Bouchons were small, vertical brownies with a small scoop of ice cream with coconut, one fresh cheerry dipped in chocolate and chilled before serving.  There was also some raspberry syrup on the plate.  The Bouchons were great.\u000a\u000aI have an affair with Bouchon.  I have been there several times and I just like the bistro atmosphere and looking out the window and seeing that lovely park area with pools on the 10th floor of the building that's so private and away from the rest of the Venetian/Venezia/Palazzo Resort.  Bouchon has been the place I've reviewed the most.  It's one of those places that just puts a smile on my face and I look forward to going there.  Service is always first rate and the food is very good.\u000a\u000aI think I have a new Bastille Day tradition that started last night!

VReview is for Spring Restaurant Week 2012 menu:\u000a\u000aThis was an extremely enjoyable meal.  I got here early enough I could sit on their patio overlooking the Fountains of Bellagio.  They had 8 LP heaters cranking out the warmth and it was great.  Nothing says success like location, location, location.  On with the meal.\u000a\u000aYou get a nice basket of bread and lavash and a three section dish with olive tapenade and olives.  One section has green olive tapenade, the middle has a small olive assortment, and the last section has a ripe olive tapenade.  The tapenade with the bread and the lavash is almost addictive.  Ask your server and you'll get the recipe they use for making the tapenade. \u000a\u000aCourse 1:  I ordered the crispy lamb lollipops with sweet corn raita, Calvados demi-glaze, Za'atar carrots, and Greek yogurt.  The description comes from their Restaurant Week menu.  It was very good, but it was poorly named.  I expected some kind of different use of lamb to create a lollipop.  Instead, they were lamb ribs.  They were tasty with a nice crispness, but it wasn't what I was expecting.  The corn was an excellent accompaniment.\u000a\u000aCourse 2:  I got the Airline chicken breast on a bed of lobster mac and cheese with broccoli florets and "Truffle Fondue, Buttered Broccoli Florets, Marsala Jus, Toasted Bread Crumbs."  The quoted part is from their description.  The word fondue is used very loosely.  The chicken was nicely grilled and seasoned well.  The meat was very juicy.\u000a\u000aCourse 3:  I got the Strawberry Mascarpone cheesecake with the center filled with a rhubarb mixture.  Excellent dessert.\u000a\u000aService was very good.  It was relaxed although the place was crowded and I was taking up a primo spot on the patio.  Iced tea was refilled often.  The courses were spaced nicely so I got to enjoy 3 fountain shows during the meal.  It really is a nice spot, and it's a place to which I'll return.  That after all is part of why restaurants participate in Restaurant Week.

VThis was one of the top dining experiences I've had in Las Vegas.  Everything was exceptional with two small nit picks. I found the service to be excellent. \u000a\u000aI had a reservation for opening at 5:30.  I wanted to have a slow meal with time left over to get from the Bellagio to a show at the Venetian at 9 PM.  I was seated promptly.  I was immediately given menus and asked if I had a show or other time constraint.  Explaining my need to be at the Venetian by 8:30 to get my tickets, my server and I agreed I had lots of time for an unhurried meal.  (I should note for one of my Yelp friends--I was offered a darker napkin option from white as I was wearing dark pants.  I kept the white.)\u000a\u000aThey had four options.  There were two dégustation menus--a regular one and a black truffle one.  They also have three course pre-theatre dinners and à la carte selections.  I ordered and iced tea which was quickly brought.  I looked at the truffle menu, but I had already decided on the regular dégustation from looking at their online menu.  There were some changes to the menu.  I ordered and the delightful dining began.\u000a\u000aBread service consisted of several kinds of rolls.  I chose an onion and bacon roll.  I really appreciated the butter.  It was in two sections--one unsalted and one salted.  I am not a fan of unsalted butter.  The butter was shaped in the Le Cirque logo and was thin in depth so it became soft quickly which is another plus for me.  I hate fighting with near-frozen unsalted butter.\u000a\u000aAn amuse-blouche of a soup with a quail egg on top started the evening.  There were a couple of pieces of Iberico ham referred to as bacon truffle in the liquid.  It was very good.  There was a thin toast round on top of the glass and it was suggested I take the spoon and pierce though to the egg and goodness below.  I wish I had noted the soup on which the quail sat but I was more intent on getting a photo and then eating.\u000a\u000aCourse one was New Zealand langoustine topped with some osetra caviar and edible gold leaf.  The plate was adorned with some tapioca, passion fruit, and apple and vodka gelée.  I liked the langoustine, but the adornments were more for that than for a taste point of view.  It was beautiful plating and pleasing to the eye.  \u000a\u000aCourse two was Santa Barbara Sea Urchin Royale with king crab and a lemon grass emulsion.  It was served in a white cup that would remind you of a sea animal.  Great plating idea and very tasty.  The sea urchin and crab were superb!\u000a\u000aCourse three was wild Atlantic turbot with roasted sunchokes, chanterelles, a celeriac purée, artichoke chips, and Barigoule sauce.  The fish was very good.\u000a\u000aCourse four was different from what I had planned.  The online menu has not been updated.  I was going to get their venison, but the menu had rotated and they hadn't changed the online version yet.  Instead, I got duck with a port wine reduction with a potato puff.  The duck was so moist and tasty and the duck jus was excellent!  The potato puff was so good I wanted to get another.  It was like you puffed a french fry after removing the potato from inside its out wrapping.  The reduction had solidified on the plate and was one point where I wondered why it was done.  A little nit pick.  Maybe it was a plating reason.\u000a\u000aAt this point, you have a choice of cheese or pre-dessert.  When I found out the pre-dessert was sorbet, I ordered the cheese.  It was a cows milk cheese from Switzerland served with some candied walnuts and two raisin bread rounds.  The cheese was delicately sculptured and the cheese course was very good.  The cheese was just a tiny bit on the way to sharp.\u000a\u000aThere were several desserts for the finishing touches.  I had ordered coconut soufflé.  They also had chocolate and Grand Marnier soufflés but he had me as soon as he said coconut.  With the soufflé was a spoon of mango sorbet and a container of chopped mango and pineapple.  The spoon of sorbet was kept in place on the plate with some brown sugar so when you picked up the spoon to have some sorbet, you also got some sugar sweetness.  Very clever and tasty!  Accompanying the soufflé, as if this wasn't enough dessert, were four mignardises--a lemon merengue tart, a raspberry tart, a caramel puff, and a dark, unsweetened chocolate goodness.  I felt guilty eating all these sweet things--well 2 seconds of guilt, that's all!\u000a\u000aService was impeccable except for my other nit pick.  As soon as you finished a course, a young man was there almost immediately to remove the plate so you didn't sit with a dirty dish.  The one time, he was almost too quick to remove the plate.  I was still eating a piece of bread when he removed the plate.  It wasn't to hurry me.  It was simply so you had a clean table in front of you.   He brought me a new glass of iced tea when my first one was almost empty.  \u000a\u000aI'm running out of review space.  This was a superb dining experience!

VI went to the Sterling Brunch yesterday to give it a try before the Bally's Steakhouse closes.  They are not sure if the Sterling Brunch will be continued.  Things seem to be in limbo right now.  About a month ago, I made a reservation on Open Table when I learned of the uncertain future.\u000a\u000aI arrived a bit early but there was no problem.  I was seated quickly after the hostess checked by Total Rewards card.  There is a small reduction in price with the TR card.  She handed me off to a maître d' who escorted me to my table.  There I was introduced to my server, John, with whom I shared some laughs and comments and from whom I received superb service.\u000a\u000aI wasn't there for the unlimited champagne which John was about to pour when I stopped him.  Instead, I asked him for some tomato juice.  He was back in a flash with a good sized glass of tomato juice.  I then made my first trip into the side room where the brunch is set up in chafing dishes on tables.  I found the one with the lobsters and got one.  I added to this a nice petit filet mignon and a lamb chop cut from a rack of lamb that was nicely rare.  The lobster tails (all four of them) were very good and quite good considering they had been grilled and were sitting in a chafing dish.  I was surprised by how tasty the filet was and how medium rare it was again given that it had been broiled and was in a chafing dish.\u000a\u000aThe second foray was for two more lobster tails and some caviar.  Now you know why I came to the Sterling Brunch.  It was the lobster but there was a good selection of brunch items besides the lobster.\u000a\u000aMy third trip was for another lobster tail.  I also got some jumbo peeled shrimp, a small amount of lox, and a half yellow tomato stuffed with crab salad.  My last two trips were for dessert to round out the experience.  The last dessert was a made to order fresh fruit crèpe with whipped cream, some more fruit and some chocolate sauce.\u000a\u000aA few things about the buffet.  The butter for the lobster and crab is melted and kept in a teapot like container.  As needed, the worker fills the small jars with butter.  The butter should be a lot warmer than it is.  It should be stored in a heated compartment and we could get our own.  It's nice to pick up a glass and go but when it's below standard, that's not the best answer.\u000a\u000aThere was so much more that I could have tried.  I skipped all the sashimi, the salads for the most part, and some the breakfast foods.  After eating four lobster tails, there wouldn't be a lot of room for those frills.\u000a\u000aOne thing that marked the brunch was the outstanding service and attitude of the servers and bussers.  Everyone was efficient, polite, had a nice smile, and were very friendly.  If you got a made to order omelette, you didn't wait.  You got your other things and it's brought to your table.  That's just how they do things.\u000a\u000aThe steakhouse is a classic Las Vegas one.  Lots of wood, booths, and a couple of small tables like the one I was at.  I noted the amount of champagne that was being poured and I heard John tell another customer that they averaged over a bottle per person.  He also would go to the kitchen and bring some special requests to tables.  That's just how the service was.\u000a\u000aI  think I'll do this again if it continues and I'll have some of the other foods and cut back on the lobster.  After all, I had no oysters either.  I must be slipping!

VI took a friend to see the show tonight.  We each have seen it twice before, but it is such a wonderful show, we had to do it again!\u000a\u000aThis truly is a classic Las Vegas production with show girls.  There are no others after Folies at the Tropicana closed. The costuming is grand, the singing is good (instrumentals are canned music), and the whole production just wows you!\u000a\u000aWe did the backstage tour this morning at 11 AM.  One of the dancers from the show took us on stage and behind the scenes to see the wardrobe areas, many of the sets, and the inner workings of the show.  If at all possible, I'd recommend you see Jubilee! on a Monday, Wednesday, or Saturday.  Do the backstage tour and then see the show that night.  The tour is an additional $15, but it will enhance your enjoyment of the show.\u000a\u000aOne final reminder - all shows EXCEPT the 7:30 PM Saturday show have some topless dancers.  The Saturday show is the family friendly show.\u000a\u000aGo and enjoy a classic Las Vegas show!

VI wonder what Don Arden and Fluff LeCoque would think of the new, relaunched Jubilee! After being closed for several weeks, it had its official relaunch at the end of March.  I saw the show last night, my 7th time seeing the show, and I am aghast at what has been done.\u000a\u000aI never thought I would go to see Jubilee! and I have a man acting as a master of ceremonies for this section of the show ask, "How you doin', Vegas?  I said, How you doin' Vegas?  Get out of your seats and clap with me."  At this point, most of us stood and clapped while some singers did a number and then we all sat back down.\u000a\u000aThe show now is a mishmash.  It doesn't know what it wants to be.  It starts out somewhat like the old Jubilee! with pretty showgirls parading in wonderful showgirl costumes.  After this, the train starts to jump the track.  We have music that tries to appeal to Boomers and near Millennials.  \u000a\u000aAlong the way, the curtain comes down and a showgirl is "lost" outside the curtain from her friends.  Thus begins Jubilee's attempt to return to the friends.  (Yep, the lost character is called Jubilee).  We see her later stage right as some sing about the lost Jubilee but then it ends.  We don't see her anymore as a lost person.  During part of her journey, she's guided by dancers carrying light sticks.  I think I had to push by jaw back in place when I saw that!\u000a\u000aThe classic Samson and Delilah and Titanic numbers remain in the show with some costume modifications and some scenery changes but they are about the same as they have been.  \u000a\u000aOne of the new parts that really was appealing was a tap dance number with just the showgirls' legs showing from the knees down. It was quite well done and lasted all of about 30 seconds.\u000a\u000aThe lighting has been changed so it often shines at the audience.  The show used to have two or three short segments between the big numbers where contract acts did specialty things.  The last time I was here, there was a person who did some work with silks.  This bit of diversion gave the dancers time to change and the tech crew time to get the scenery changes in place.  These specialty segments are now gone.\u000a\u000aThere are some good projections but seriously do you have to make it seem like  Caesars Entertainment is the only thing on the Strip.  I know Bally's is a CET property but come on, showing The Cromwell, the High Roller, Caesars Palace et. al. in some of the projection is amazing!  We know where we are.  We're on the Las Vegas seeing what was a classic Las Vegas topless showgirl review that has been relaunched.  Keeping the Titanic in the show is quite correct.  The Jubilee! ship is sinking.  Time to play Nearer My God To Thee for Jubilee! \u000a\u000aEdit: I have to add that the final scene is as marvelous as ever.  A grand staircase with lovely showgirls coming down in their heels and wonderful costumes. The ending is classic!  \u000a\u000aIt saddens me to see what they've done to this show.  Judging by attendance last night, it's not working and that's a shame!

VCue "Moon River" in my mind.  Now just say it, "OK, I had breakfast at Tiffany's."  There was no Hepburn anywhere near the place but I couldn't help being reminded of the movie.\u000a\u000aI stopped here for breakfast yesterday and I was glad I did.  I had been going to eat at the Huntridge, but the food operation there is permanently closed I was told.  So, off to Tiffany's for me.\u000a\u000aI had the Spanish Omelette.  A nice omelette with jalapeño slices, green pepper, cubed tomato with cheese on top.  Accompanying that  was a generous portion of home fries and rye toast.  I added some Tabasco my server brought before bringing my breakfast, and I had a spicy and flavorful omelette.\u000a\u000aWhile sitting there sipping my coffee, I noticed a sign on the wall from 2005 noting the place would be closed for a couple of weeks for the shooting of a movie.  The sign had Robert Duvall's autograph.  I asked the server what the movie was and she told me it was "Lucky You."  I Googled and saw it was a movie with a poker playing plot that had been shot on location in Las Vegas.  Well I knew that having breakfast at Tiffany's was not going to be the movie thing, but it turned out to be a different movie.\u000a\u000aI'm glad I stopped in.  It's good to support a local business!\u000a\u000aEdit:  For those who want to go here. the entrance directly to the lunch counter area is at the northeast corner of the property where Oakey and Las Vegas Boulevard intersect.  You can see Luv It Custard as you sit at the counter.  Maybe a 2fer?

VThis is an excellent buffet.  We had dinner here tonight.  I loved the Kobe sirloin, the mushroom ravioli with truffle pieces, and the roast lamb.  There was also some good salmon poke and jumbo peeled shrimp.  \u000a\u000aThe food items are laid out in a nice order and they're easily accessible.  Of course, what would dinner be without mentioning desserts.  That is why we eat, no?  I had a dark chocolate, raspberry cone (a mini chocolate ice cream cone filled with creamy dark chocolate and fresh raspberries) and Key Lime tart.\u000a\u000aI would have given the buffet 5 stars except our server was quite slow despite the fact he didn't appear to have that many tables.  Iced tea refills were slow and he was slow to clear plates.\u000a\u000aI'll be back again to eat some of the things I didn't get to today like split crab legs, ahi poke, and some more of their excellent seafood dishes.

VI have liked this buffet over the years and I still do.  There are better ones in the general area, but this has many items that make a visit here a treat.\u000a\u000aTheir grilled vegetables--yellow squash, eggplant, carrots, red onion, and asparagus were all very tasty and grilled just right.  I like their split crab legs and the peeled shrimp.\u000a\u000aI have always like the Spice Market's cheese tray.  I had some nice pieces of bleu cheese this evening to enjoy with dinner.\u000a\u000aThen I turned my attention to the Middle Eastern section where I had some lamb kebabs, chicken kebab, and hummus.  I enjoyed them all.\u000a\u000aFinally, dessert.  For the first time at this buffet, I had their made to order crepe.  I tried the Bananas Foster.  It's semi hand made as the crepes are pre-made.  The cook heats the crepe in a pan and adds whatever filling you want from a nice selection, folds it, and puts any topping on it you want.\u000a\u000aService was excellent.  The server brought me a new glass of iced tea before I was finished with the one I had.  \u000a\u000aWe will be back.

VI have seen Mystère three times and I still enjoy every moment of the show.  It was the first Cirque show I ever saw, and there's something special about it.\u000a\u000aThe acrobatics, the strong men, the costumes, the live music--they all make one top notch show.\u000a\u000aIf you like a more traditional type of circus act, Mystère would be the Cirque show for you.\u000a\u000aDon't come late.

V*** Review is for Spring Restaurant Week 2014 menu ***\u000a\u000aI arrived about 10 minutes before the restaurant opened and I sat in the bar area until opening.  I was seated promptly at 5:30.  Shortly, Brad came by and asked about drinks.  I ordered an iced tea which was quickly brought.  I asked about the Restaurant Week menu.  They didn't have a separate printing of it but Brad had it stored in his memory.  Since I had decided after looking at it online, he didn't have to say a whole lot.  I also asked him for recommendations.\u000a\u000aI started with the Burrata with a peach and avocado caprese.  The server ground fresh pepper for extra flavor that enhanced the burrata and the fruit.  In addition to the peach cubes, there were some apple, tomato, and arugula.  It was a beautiful starter with lots of flavor.  The burrata was creamy soft and good.\u000a\u000aShortly after finishing the starter course, Andrew brought me an amuse-bouche.  He explained that they waited until after the burrata so as not to disturb the flavors of the burrata with the amuse.  The amuse-bouche was a small bite of ahi tuna.  It rested on a base of Peruvian pepper purée which gave it a great peppery klck.  It was very tasty!\u000a\u000aNext, I was brought a small plate with a demitasse of lobster bisque and a small crab cake with a chayote-radish slaw and resting on a creole remoulade sauce.  This was just a little something extra to introduce me to AquaKnox's lobster bisque and crab cake, two of their signature dishes.  Both were absolutely superb!  It left me wanting more on a future visit.\u000a\u000aFor the main course, Brad had suggested their Picahna beef but since I was at a seafood restaurant, I overrode his suggestion and went with the Zataar spiced albacore tuna with roasted vegetable quinoa.  and a mango-lomongrass chimmichurri.  The tuna was perfectly cooked and the za'atar spice on the tuna enhanced the dish so much.  The tuna was on a bed of red quinoa that had tomatoes, broccolini, cauliflower, and small carrot slices. The texures of the crisp vegestables with the quinoa and soft tuna was stellar.  \u000a\u000aAfter enjoying the main course, I had Laura's Lemon tart with fresh berries for dessert.  The tart had lemon cream in the center pastry and the lemon was topped with blackberries, blueberries, paspberries, kiwi, and thinly slices apple.  On the side were some pistachio pieces.  What a perfect end to a great meal.\u000a\u000aService was impeccable from start to finish.  Brad and Andrew double teamed me and made sure that I always had anything I needed.  They both stopped back to see if everything was OK.  They brought a fresh glass of iced tea before my main course so I had a fresh glass even though my first glass still was 1/3 full.  This is one of those places where the person seating you gives you a dark or white napkin to more closely match the color you're wearing.\u000a\u000aAs it turned out, I knew one of the bussers from theatre in Las Vegas.  He stopped by a couple of times to say hello and also check on me.  That level of service is something you like to have but often fall short of receiving.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant got crowded quickly and between the bar area, the music, and the general level of talking, the place could be described as vibrant.  Since I was dining alone and had no one to chat with aside from Brad, Andrew, and Brandon, it was quite OK for me.  The three course plus amuses lasted just under two hours and was a wonderful second restaurant for this restaurant week.

VThis is absolutely the gold standard of Cirque du Soleil shows.  This was my third time seeing the show, and it was as good as the other two times.  I am in awe of the wonderfully talented cast.  I am also filled with awe when I look at the hydraulics and things that make the show work and be outstanding.  Finally, the stage is often a scene stealer.\u000a\u000aThere are breaks in the action with some humor.  I love this part as much as the rest.  The fish TV antenna is quite funny and #39 whatever street.\u000a\u000aThe costumes are exceptional.  I have read how Cirque needs to replace them often because the chlorine from the water breaks down the fabric.  \u000a\u000aThe live music is a wonderful accompaniment to the show.  It makes everything seamless.  \u000a\u000aThis is a great show!

VI saw "O" for the fourth time this past Thursday and it was excellent as always!  I first saw the show in 2004 and I have gone back every three years--not planned--but it just worked out that way.  I had a front row seat in the center section and it gave me a different view of the show than I've had before.  \u000a\u000aI remain amazed by the theatre and it never fails to make me say, "Eau."  The acrobatics performed by sometimes wet performers, the swimming accents, the motorized sea horses (my words) all add up to a big wow factor!\u000a\u000aThe clowns are quite funny and I enjoy the interludes they provide.  The man on fire has always amazed me, too!  The thing that I like so much is that there are a lot of small things that make up the entire show--the way the red jacketed men run, the costumes, the man in black, and the divers.  It all comes together in this marvelous show that is so very entertaining. \u000a\u000aI am a fan of Cirque du Soleil shows--well except for one.  This still is my favorite.  It would be very hard to top this!

VI have seen Kà four times starting in 2005 and the last time in January 2010.  It is an amazing show.  It was the first Cirque show to have a story line.  While not defined especially well, it's not necessary to know the story to enjoy the show.\u000a\u000aFrom the moment you walk in and see the theatre, you know you're in for a good show.  The theatre is amazing and this is but the beginning.  The acrobatics, costumes, and talent of this amazing crew blows me away each time I see the show.\u000a\u000aI like the "greeters" that the show employs to see you to your seat and interact with you before the show starts.  Once seated, the sounds from the stereo speakers built into the seats is another sign of good things to come.\u000a\u000aThe hydraulics of the stage intrigues me.  I would love to have a backstage tour and see this theatre and the stage up close.  It would be very informative.\u000a\u000aAlthough "O" is my favorite Cirque show in Las Vegas, you can't go wrong with Kà.  It is superb!

VI went here tonight (4/27/10) to the reopened upstairs room and had the five course tasting menu.  It was absolutely excellent in all aspects - service, food, atmosphere, and of course, meeting Chef Moonen was a huge bonus!  He's a finalist in the Top Chef Masters program on Bravo.\u000a\u000ai did the 5 course tasting menu - price $65.  The choices were intriguing!  I wanted to try everything.  The staff explained the courses and were anxious to take any and all questions about the restaurant, the menu, or anything else about RM Seafood.\u000a\u000aI started with the Black & White, a scallop with coconut strips and garlic.  Then I had the Onion Soup 3000, a view of what the chef thinks soups will become.  Next up was Walu, then pork belly, and finally the Italian themed dessert.  There was an extra small dessert of three sweets and everyone is served a wonderful lemongrass infused herbal tea with a small show.\u000a\u000aI have photos of 4 of the 5 courses with descriptions, but I forgot to take a photo of the 3rd course, the Walu in Cherry leaf.\u000a\u000aI really enjoyed this evening.  Dining alone, I was there about 2 hours.  The room is very pleasant, the staff is extraordinary, and the food is first rate.  I'll go again!

VA 5 star dining experience in every respect.  I was greeted at the podium by two lovely ladies who both expressed a hearty "welcome back" to me.  I was shown to my table which was one row in from the windows overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  The table was waiting for me.  There was just one chair and one place setting waiting.  \u000a\u000aMy server was Blake.  He had a great sense of humor, was helpful when I asked for a suggestion (later at dessert time), and he was there without hovering.  I noticed him approaching out of the corner of my eye when I was taking a photo and he just detoured to the next table.  When I was done, he came back.  He said I wouldn't want his hand in my photo.\u000a\u000aI got the dégustation menu.  There was an amuse-bouche--a small tea cup with some red bell pepper soup and a pheasant croquette.  The soup was very tasty and the croquette was equally tasty.  A nice way to start.\u000a\u000aBread service is not the usual basket on the table.  A bus person comes around and gives you two types of bread.  This is one area that could use a little upgrading, but best not to fill up on bread so I give Picasso a pass on this point.\u000a\u000aFirst course--lobster salad.  I enjoyed the taste of the "salad" and the plating was whimsically done.  This is really not a salad, but a dish with a mound of lobster and some micro greens, pear tomato halves, some tiny melon balls, and some whole pink peppercorns which was a delight to chew along with the salad.\u000a\u000aSecond course--One scallop on a mound of potato mousseline with a ring of veal jus.  There was one very thin, lightly fried potato slice that was bent and sticking up like a little covering for the scallop.  Excellent presentation.  The scallop was perfect!\u000a\u000aThird course--Foie gras.  A superb piece of foie gras with some almond slices, roasted pistachio pieces (ground) and a small brioche with rhubarb filling.  The plating had one line of tangerine sauce connection the foie gras with the brioche.\u000a\u000aFourth course--I chose the Colorado rack of lamb.  It's not really a rack of lamb but rather was a think lamb medallion that I asked to be done rare and it was exactly the way it should be.  Again, the plating was impeccably done.\u000a\u000aDessert--What to get?  The dessert menu had 6 choices.  When Blake came by and I asked his advice, he pointed to two choices, both of which were at the top of my list.  He tipped the scale in favor of the chocolate truffle beignets.  Imagine three small round beignets filled with warm chocolate truffle, accompanied by peanut butter ice cream.  The ice cream was atop a small tart of rich creme that had some large pearl tapioca in it.  There was a small piece of crackled peanut butter by the tart.  This was an absolute fine ending to a wonderful meal.  Again I have to mention the plating.  This is what makes a dining experience like this memorable.\u000a\u000aAfter dessert, you're given a small tray with 7 truffles.  Obviously this would be for two people.  Since I was by myself, I made the sacrifice and ate them all.  One was a miniature lemon meringue tart!  Heaven!\u000a\u000aAbout the service.  There was one bus person and one waiter assigned to the tables in my area.  The bus person was always there refilling my iced tea, taking plates away, asking if I wanted more bread, always aware of the needs of each table.  When I was fidgeting with my camera bag when I first sat down, he came over and hooked it on one of those table hooks I think originally made to hold a woman's purse.  \u000a\u000aA final note--during the meal a woman came by and greeted me and she said "welcome back" too.  Later I asked Blake if this was a common way of greeting guests as it was my first time at Picasso.  He said the computer had me listed as a repeat guest.  \u000a\u000aOn leaving, you're given a small box with 3 palmiers.  The box has the ubiquitous Picasso on it.  Dessert for tonight.\u000a\u000aThis truly was a special dining experience!  I have added a few photos, but I tried not to duplicate the ones already posted.

VWe were meeting friends for dinner, so we went a bit early and played some video poker until it was time to meet.  The casino is a pleasant enough place.  It's laid out conveniently from the 21 parking deck to get to the casino and the buffet.\u000a\u000aMy only negative about the place was in the bank I was playing, there were a couple of machines that had maintenance issues.  Is the management aware that a machine that refuses to accept cash or TITOs is not much of a grosser for the casino?  I was ready to give up and go to the Sports Book and watch a game when one machine finally decided take my money for play.\u000a\u000aI hope they get to these machines and don't let more slip into disrepair.  To me, that's a sign of sloppy management which one sees evidenced in other aspects of the property.  Come on GVR, get on the ball!\u000a\u000aOn a very positive note, the cocktail waitress was around 3 times in the brief time I was playing.  She knew how to do the job pleasantly and well!

VI have been to the Grand Lux for dinner 4 times - twice here and twice at the Palazzo.  All 4 times, I've had the crispy caramel chicken.  It's an excellent dish with good tasting, deep fried battered chicken with a caramel glaze.  The glaze is a bit on the sweet side, but I like it.\u000a\u000aLast night, I stayed true to form and ordered that.  I had a choice of brown or white rice and I went with the brown.  DInner was very good.  My wife had the Madeira chicken.  It was served with very creamy, good tasting mashed potatoes.  We shared a piece of chocolate cake for dessert.  It was huge.\u000a\u000aService was a bit slow last night, but we got here at the height of the busy time with people wanting to have dinner before going to see Phantom as was the case with us.  We had plenty of time and I didn't obsess with the time factor because I knew we were good.\u000a\u000aOur server boxed our leftovers--dinner tonight--and brought it back quickly.  I had time to walk it to the car in the garage and put it in the cooler I brought anticipating a take out box or boxes.  I wish they had more large small plates on their menu.  Or if they would just downsize any of their meals for a downsized price.\u000a\u000aMy only complaint with Grand Lux is the level of the music.  It was not on when we first arrived. 10 minutes later, someone must have realized and they fired up the sound system.  At one point, it was so loud, I had to almost yell for my wife to hear me.  It got so bad, I downloaded an app for my iPhone and the decibel level averaged about 85 all the time we were there.  At times it spiked in the 90s and near 100.  That's just too loud!!  Turn it down!

VIsla is really a big contradiction.  The room is quite nice and it's arranged well.  Then you're brought chips and salsa.  Someone decided it would be cool looking to have a metal frame that holds chips on the bottom and 3 bowls on the top for the salsas.  They are fixed--they don't move lazy Susan style.  It makes it a bit challenging to reach up into one of the small bowls to retrieve some red salsa (no heat), tomatillo salsa, or pico.  If my wife had been with me, those little bowls would have been removed and placed on the table for easier dipping.  But, it does look different.\u000a\u000aI ordered the carnitas dish.  While another reviewer noted the saltiness of the dishes, I looked for salt and pepper on my table.  There is absolutely NONE!  I guess you have to ask for it.  There was also NO Cholula nor Tapatio on any table.  By the time I got my server to stop long enough, I was 2/3 of the way through my meal.  Is this really a Tex-Mex place?  My carnitas were OK but nothing that I can't get in any number of places around town for a lot less.  The redeeming part of the meal was dessert.  The crèpes were quite good and the ice cream in the sweetened tortilla bowl was very good and a great ending to a lackluster meal.\u000a\u000aMy server had too many tables to cover including those in the bar area which is semi-closed off from the restaurant section.  I don't think I'd return to Isla.  I'm glad I had a Groupon.

VI really like Garduños.  We used to go to the outlet in the Santa Fe, but I prefer going to this Garduños.  I had the chili verde con machaca.  That's what I always have.  I think they have the best chili verde I ever order.  It's spicy, tasty, and filling.  The sour cream, cilantro, and red onion that come with the chili are very good additions.\u000a\u000aThe salsa bar is good, but I wish the cups had a bit larger top.  It's a small thing, but have you tried to dip a chip into a salsa container the size of a half dollar.  I sometimes just spoon the salsa onto my chip which is backwards.\u000a\u000aWe shared flan for dessert.  It's a different texture flan than I'm used to, but it was a good dessert and just perfect for two people for sharing.\u000a\u000aI'll be back!

VMy dinner yesterday at Garduños was off because someone was asleep or just didn't care about doing things correctly.  I ordered the Chile verde con machaca--the beef version of their chile.  The server brought me Chile verde which is their chile with chicken.  I was OK with that because I always order the machaca so this was good for a change.\u000a\u000aIn addition to that mixup, the dish came without charro beans and without the chopped onion and cilantro that they always serve with the chile.  I'm not sure if they were in a hurry or if the quality of staff is suffering.  The server could have made an error with my order, but the server didn't make the error with the plating.\u000a\u000aCome on Garduños, get with it or you'll be off my radar.

VI went to a play at the Plaza last night.  This review is for the casino and and renovations only.\u000a\u000aThe Plaza is pretty much the same as it was before but new.  There is new carpeting, new slot machines, and new table game pit tables.  The layout is the same as before, but it has a fresher look.  They are also putting a nice scent into the air and the place wasn't smoky last night like it used to be.  The air flow must have been improved.\u000a\u000aThe new Insurgo Theatre Movement theatre is on the 3rd floor next to the bingo room.  The theatre was a cabaret from the looks of what I saw last night.  It's odd to go to a play and have a nicely dressed cocktail waitress delivering drinks while actors are delivering lines (well only once).  She was also sufficiently unclothed to be worthy of the title of a Las Vegas cocktail server.  She was also really pleasant.\u000a\u000aThe garage is still the awful thing it's always been.  The 2nd floor was mostly blocked off because this is Bikefest 2011 (motorcycles), so they had an area reserved for those noise makers.\u000a\u000aThere was a lot of security everywhere last night and Metro and they may be due to the Bikefest,\u000a\u000aI won't be a regular at the Plaza.  Why drive 10 miles when there's a much nicer place a mile from home.  I will go to see plays there, but that will be about it.

VI have walked by this restaurant so many times and not really noticed that it was something more than a crêperie or a pizza place.  Then I saw this on Groupon and decided to give it a go.\u000a\u000aThe meal was OK.  For starters, they brought a bread basket with a small loaf of Italian bread and two breadsticks.  The server poured some olive oil and balsamic onto a dish for dipping.  Since I'm not a big fan of balsamic, which I think is too sweet, I liberally sprinkled my dipping mixture with salt to cut the sweetness.  The bread was fresh and tasty.\u000a\u000aI ordered the lobster bisque for an appetizer.  It had a lobster flavor but there were no pieces of lobster to be found.  There were two ravioli on the bottom of the bowl that may have had some type of ground lobster filling but there was no flavor of lobster from the ravioli.\u000a\u000aFor the main course, I ordered the New York strip steak and frites.  I also ordered a side of wilted spinach.  I ordered the steak black and blue and I specified extra rare.  The meat was done more than that but it was acceptable.  I wish they'd just do black and blue.  You can't un-cook meat but you can heat it some more if it's too rare.  The steak was a bit tough to cut, but it was OK to eat.  Perhaps they need better steak knives?  The spinach came with lots of freshly sliced garlic and was very good.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I ordered the crème brûlée.  It was different than I've had before.  My server told me to make sure I spooned to the bottom.  This brûlée had a layer of semi-sweet chocolate on the bottom and then the vanilla bean crème with the glazed top.  There were some blueberries and a 1/2 strawberry on top.  Dessert was very good.\u000a\u000aService was very good.  My server, Frank and his bus person, Umberto, were on top of things.  Iced tea was refilled without asking and Frank came often to check on how I was doing and to see if I needed anything.  I was greeted promptly at the podium and the woman asked me if I had any comp, coupon, Groupon or anything else like that.  When I said Groupon, she told me to make sure I showed it to the server.\u000a\u000aAt the end of the meal, Frank asked me if I would take a short survey they were doing.  There were at most 10 questions with an excellent to poor scale to rate various aspects of dining at Le Provençal.  It was actually a 32 gb iPod in a large case so you didn't pocket it and walk out the door.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant is a little pricey.  Comparing it to Mon Ami Gabi, I'd go with Gabi for the entire experience.  I'm glad I gave this place a try.  It was a pleasant experience and a fairly good meal.  Note: If you have a Total Rewards card, almost all items on the menu are discounted by $1 and you get TR credits because the restaurant is owned by CET rather than being a leased operation not owned by the hotel.

VI like to stop here once a month, spend a few dollars playing some old and some new pinball machines, and relive a bit of my younger days.  Imagine playing an old baseball pinball game where you're pitched a little metal ball and press the button to swing the bat.   Now that's a classic!\u000a\u000aMy wife and a neighbor get their hair done at a nearby salon.  The Hall of Fame gives me the chance to escape from their world of teasing, blow dryers, and hairspray into a world of fantasy.  While I never was a pinball pro, I have been getting enough practice at the new place that I can do relatively well--sometimes.\u000a\u000aI am so thrilled the PH of F moved from its previous location to this one right off Trop.  It's so easy to get to and the parking is just great!  I am especially glad to see the new mix of customers.  Before it seemed like it was hardcore gamer who came.  Now I see a nice mix of men and women, tourists and locals, young and old.\u000a\u000aI hope this place keeps doing well.  I'll be back often--well at least once a month!

VI came here with 4 friends after hiking at Red Rock Canyon and we were all really hungry.  4 of us ordered the AYCE and 1 ordered off the menu.  I have not had much experience with AYCE sushi--I've only been to one other sushi place for AYCE.  \u000a\u000aWe placed quite a few orders of various Nigiri sushi with some extra things like miso soup, shrimp tempura, and a few other things (I got a 4 piece Mexican roll).  The fish was fresh and tasty.  \u000a\u000aService was good.  There was a misstep or two when something ordered was not brought but given the amount we ordered, I guess I could expect this.  \u000a\u000aMy biggest issue with the place is that it is so small.  5 people at one table and with all the plates that were brought meant that our table was quite crowded.  This made for good conversation and sharing of what had been ordered, but I was amazed I didn't elbow one of my dining companions during the meal.\u000a\u000aThere is a 45 minute time limit for lunch and an hour for dinner but the way we scarfed everything down, we almost had time to spare although we weren't watching the time and I don't think they were either.\u000a\u000aThe red bean ice cream for dessert was very good.  I wish they had mochi on the AYCE menu.  Rather, they just had three ice cream flavors.\u000a\u000aI will come back and sit at the sushi bar--my wife is a hater of fish (raw or otherwise)--and I'll do the AYCE.  Maybe I'll go slower and really enjoy the meal.

VI went to McCarran Airport today to get some photos of Air Force One parked on the tarmac.  After the photo shoot, I visited Jean Philippe for the second time at its Aria location.  I like this better than the Bellagio because there are more tables to enjoy your choice du jour.  \u000a\u000aI got a Forest crepe.  It's a whole wheat crepe with an egg that's broken and spread on the heating crepe.  Then swiss cheese, ham, and mushrooms are added.  The crepe is folded and heated thoroughly so the cheese melts.\u000a\u000aI sat at the one of the seats facing the casino and people watched.  It's great fun to live in this wonderful city and treat yourself like this.  \u000a\u000aI love JP and I will be returning if only for some gelato.

VFirst the gripe:  this place would definitely be a four or four and a half star except for the fact that my server called me "bub."  I have never been referred to like this anywhere at anytime.  When he brought my bill, he called me "sir" for the first time.  When he had my credit card, he called me by my last name.  At least 1 star off for this awful customer interaction!  If I ever come back, if you don't call me bub, I won't call you Mikey.\u000a\u000aNow for the good.  This was my first time at Bradley Ogden.  Nice first impression, no?  I ordered from the prix fixe Celine menu.  I had to ask for it and as Candace remarked in her review, this server made no attempt to talk about either menu nor to ask me if I had any questions.\u000a\u000aI started with the Maytag Blue Cheese Soufflé.  It was delicious.  There was a cranberry relish and some small cubes of beets and one pice of candied walnut.  I love blue cheese and this was a great start.  For the main course, I got the Duroc Pork Loin that came over a bed of long beans, and a cute round pot with lid that was filled with cornbread pudding as the starch.  The pork had a light mustard vinaigrette scallion sauce.  There was one piece of fried pork. There were two large pieces of pork and it was juicy and cooked perfectly. For dessert, I got the Bananas Foster Cake with macerated bananas with the cake.  There was some sauce over the banana bread, shaped like pieces of muffin, and there was a side of cream cheese ice cream.\u000a\u000aThere was nothing about the food I didn't like.  The bus people and the woman who delivered the food from the kitchen and explained the dishes were quite competent.  It would have been a higher rating if it hadn't been for Mikey.  I get treated better at McDonalds.

VWe met friends from out of town who are staying at Encore at the buffet for dinner.  The cost for two makes this an expensive buffet.  What you're buying is the chance to try a number of different things you don't see on many menus.  \u000a\u000aMy wife had most vegetable items and salad.  I had a little of several things - a lamb chop, some risotto, baked fall vegetable medley, curried chuck peas, and some jerk chicken.  Everything was well prepared.  I marveled that the lamb chops could be sitting there and yet still be rare.  \u000a\u000aDesserts were good.  I wasn't bowled over by anything in particular.  Perhaps I should have tried a crèpe, but I didn't take the time to wait for one to be made.\u000a\u000aAt $75 for two people. you're at a level where two people could have a nice meal at a regular restaurant.  It's a tough call.  That's why we don't come here that often.

VFour of us met for lunch at the Country Club at Wynn.  I had the Cobb salad with chicken and an iced tea.  Another had the watermelon gazpacho and a shrimp cocktail.  The third meal was the Wynn sandwich, and the last person had the Wynn hot dog.  \u000a\u000aService was very good.  We all enjoyed our meals.  One bummer was we couldn't sit outside nor go out to see the golf course because they were in process of overseeding the course and watering it quite a bit.  Next time.\u000a\u000aThe room is nice, and I will be back.  I do want to try the hot dog the next time.  I love the condiments they serve with the dog.

VI have seen Blue Man Group 5 times (once in the poncho section)--the same number of times I've seen Carrot Top.  I say this so you have an idea that I'm an aficionado of good humor or you may think I'm completely nuts.  Who cares?\u000a\u000aThe Blue Men make me laugh.  I don't think the show has changed very much from when I first saw it at the Luxor to its long stay at the Venetian.  They touch some basic in me from the moment I enter the theatre and watch the moving messages.  \u000a\u000aThere are some parts of the show when I laugh harder than others - I'm glad for the breather - but then it's back to complete insanity.  I imagine that if the Three Stooges did a silent routine wearing blue paint, some of it would be just like what you see during a Blue Man Group show.\u000a\u000aThe live band is superb!  They are loud, so be prepared.  But, you came to enjoy yourself, didn't you?  So pull your poncho a little closer to you and prepare to have a blast.  This show is great!

VThis was one of those dining experiences when I knew from the time I was greeted that it was going to be a special dinner.  I made reservations as a Yelp friend had recommended well in advance of the date I wanted.  I had a ticket to see 'O' at 7:30 and this was one of the Bellagio restaurants that I never went to and also one that opens at 5 giving me plenty of time to enjoy dinner and not worry about making the show on time.\u000a\u000aI was seated promptly after a few parties ahead of me.  I was taken to a side room in the front--not one of the coveted center tables directly overlooking the fountains--but it was a really nice room and I could see much of the fountain show in any case.  My servers were Team #18.  I'm not sure if the waiter gave me his name or not.  If he did, I missed it.  He asked about drinks, gave me the menu, and explained some of the things on the menu.  I was also brought a nice selection of bread and some butter.  The bread had been warmed nicely.\u000a\u000aI started with the tomato gazpacho.  The bowl had several groupings of avocado, celery, some peanuts and other goodies.  Onto this vegetable grouping, the server poured the cold gazpacho.  He then ground some fresh pepper on the soup and I was off enjoying the first course.\u000a\u000aFor the main course, I got the 14 ounce filet with bone in cooked barely--blue.  It was accompanied by two shishito peppers.  I also got a side of gratin dauphinois with Comté, a gussied up name for potatoes au gratin.  When I saw Comté, I knew this was it.  It's the kind of cheese I always buy for eating at home.  The steak was done exactly the way I like.  The potatoes were excellent.  A very pleasant side dish that I almost finished.  With the steak, the waiter brought a platter with three sauces, peppercorn, a classic Béarnaise, and their house soy, rice wine sauce.  Of the three, I liked the soy, rice wine the best but I used it sparingly.  I'm generally a purist when it comes to steak.  It really doesn't need a sauce.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I got the coconut soufflé with chocolate sorbet.  The plating was beautiful.  The soufflé was perfect and the round of sorbet on a small bed of toasted coconut was a perfect accompaniment.  \u000a\u000aNow as to service--it couldn't have been better.  It was top notch.  The server was a friendly gentleman and the bus person was quite efficient.  I had a fresh glass of iced tea before I finished the first one.  The plates were cleared promptly and when my server said the soufflé would only take 7 minutes, he was correct.\u000a\u000aThe maitre d'hôtel came around twice during the meal to check how things were and we chatted for a bit.  It was a grand meal and I'll be returning.  This would be a great anniversary dinner.  I think I'll make the reservation soon!

VI ate here tonight (4/28/10) and was underwhelmed.  First off, I had planned on having the Blue Man Group prix fixe dinner.  When I got there, I found out that it was only if you bought that option with your BMG ticket.  I was there to see Chazz Palminteri's A Bronx Tale.  \u000a\u000aI then ordered off the main menu.  I got the Duck confit and had the Croissant pudding for dessert.  Service was good, but for the price, I should have gone elsewhere.  Even Grand Luxe would have been a better choice.  \u000a\u000aOne thing that really bothered me was that they didn't offer a damp cloth, even a casino wet wipe, to help get the stickiness off my fingers from holding onto the duck leg.  That's one of the reasons I rarely get duck out.  This sealed the deal for me.  I won't be back.

VI really like this buffet.  There are a lot of choices that don't appear on ordinary buffets.  In addition, Nevada residents eat 1/2 price Monday through Thursday for lunch or dinner, so it's a great value.\u000a\u000aTonight, I enjoyed the Chinese duck, beef tamale, some Chinese pork, and some wonderful white bean and tomato salad.  These were the highlights before I went to the dessert table.\u000a\u000aI would have given this 4 stars, but service was awful.  Our server didn't clear dishes, he didn't bring drink refills, nor did he come around to see if we needed anything.  Drop the place settings, extra napkins, and off he was.  Awful!  This is the first time I didn't tip at all.  He needed to know he was awful.  I was thinking of leaving him a dollar so he would know we didn't forget, but he didn't deserve that.

VHad I written this review when I first saw Le Reve, it would have been 5 stars.  Since that first time, I've seen the show three more times and I think it has gone downhill more and more.\u000a\u000aThe latest time I saw the show, I was awfully disappointed.  What had been the best music for any Dragone or Cirque show was now changed in several places and jazzed up.  Some of Benoît Jutras' songs have been dropped, some changed in tempo, and others mere shells of their former selves.\u000a\u000aIn trying to get away from "O," Wynn has changed Le Reve so it's less water show and more "Dancing With the Stars."  I think part of the decision was to break from "O" but also was brought about by the design of the theatre.  It is a superb theatre with truly no bad seats in the house.  Since it's in the round, the problem becomes that sets can only be changed through the water or lowered from above.  This led to the earlier "up and down" blues of the earlier version.  Swimmers went up and down and up and down.  With a new emphasis on dance, the need for set changes is lessened, and you can have different things going on and no new sets--just new music.\u000a\u000aThe final disappointment for me was the dropping of the pre-show entertainment by the guys dressed in white.  This little pre-show playful interaction between performers and the audience was always so welcomed.  Now, there's nothing, but Wynn wanted a higher class show.  \u000a\u000aMy summary is that the show is OK, but it's a mere shell of how good it once was.  This is one show I won't see again!

VI have been to Le Village buffet a number of times but it has always been for lunch or dinner.  Today, I met some friends from the East who I was taking hiking at Mount Charleston and we decided to have breakfast here.  It was a good choice.\u000a\u000aWe were there when it opened at 7 AM, and we were the first at the omelette/fresh egg station.  I got an omelette made with mushrooms, spinach, jalapeños, and cheese.  The omelette was quickly done by the cook and it was very good.  I also had a few slices of bacon.  It was not crisp nor limp but somewhere in between.  Now it was time for dessert.\u000a\u000aI walked over to the crèpe section.  I studied the list of crèpes and decided on the second one, the crèpe made with fresh strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries.  The cook poured the batter, spread it around the griddle with his little crèpe plow, evening out the batter so it was a thin pancake on the griddle.  He turned it and then filled it with the fruit listed above.  After folding it expertly, he topped it with some fresh whipped cream and then spread some raspberry coulis on the whipped cream.  The crèpe was so hot, the whipped cream slid off as I walked back to the table.\u000a\u000aI thoroughly enjoyed breakfast here.  Service was good and the individual stations had great choices.  I could go back again and have several completely different things.  \u000a\u000aThis is a very strong breakfast buffet!

VI was going to try Chef Keller's restaurant when it was Fleur de Lys, but I never got there.  Finally, I went to the new concept, Fleur, a small plate menu that is quite creative.\u000a\u000aI'll mention my server right in the beginning.  Kathleen was perfect.  She helped explain the dishes when I had questions, she recommended certain dishes as potential tries, but she wasn't in the business of pushing more plates.  She was great!  After telling me most people order three, she suggested I try two and see how much that filled me up and decide then.\u000a\u000aFor starters, I ordered the white onion soup velouté and the tarte flambée.  The onion soup was excellent.  It was very good and the velouté gave it a different taste but there was still the flavor of onion coming through nicely.  The I got the tarte flambée.  It's a flatbread with bacon, asparagus, truffle, crème fraiche, and and onion.  This, too, was a tasty small plate and quite a different take on standard flatbreads.\u000a\u000aI wasn't full yet, so I stayed in France--the menu is divided into different countries--and I got the seared foie gras with braised beef cheek and shallot jus.  This was outstanding.  The foie gras was excellent.  I've only had one other foie gras that would hands down beat this one.\u000a\u000aI still had a little room, so I just had to order dessert.  The menu lists exotic panna cotta.  This was a small glass jar with a layer of pineapple panna cotta on the bottom and then a layer of coconut.   On top was some fresh fruit, some coconut and some crisps that gave the dessert a wonderful texture.\u000a\u000aThis was a very pleasant dining experience.  It's amazing how quickly small plates can add up when you get your bill.\u000a\u000aThe only thing I'd change about the place was the music.  What it was, I have no idea.  It was really bad.  Since I was dining alone, perhaps I heard it more than if I were there with someone and talked through it.  In any case, it's not good.

VWe were going to the Palms for a free buffet.  Fortunately for us, many of the 15,000 other people who got the mailing were waiting in line.  I won't wait for something like that.  Off to 24/7 Cafe we went.\u000a\u000aI had the Lobster and Crab Cobb salad.  That's quite a twist on the classic dish to start with, but instead of bleu cheese, this Cobb had Boursin.  It also had some hearts of palm.  The salad was superb!\u000a\u000aMy wife had a spinach and feta cheese omelet and she was quite pleased with her meal.\u000a\u000aBefore placing our order, I accidentally looked at the dessert section.  Well, I was hooked.  I ordered the Nutella crèpe.  It was a lovely crèpe filled with heavenly Nutella with some whipped cream artfully placed on the dish.  Along with some fresh strawberry slices, this made a heavenly dessert.  I'll be back for this dynamic duo again.  Why didn't I have my camera when I should have?\u000a\u000aOur server, Adriana, was a delight.  She always had a nice smile and she was very efficient and helpful.  We'll ask for her if she's on duty.\u000a\u000aI never thought I'd give a casino coffee shop 5 stars, but here I am saying, à la Top Chef Masters, "Five Stars!!"

VWhat is it about the Palms buffet that there's always a line when I am going there.  So many people complain about it, you'd think I could walk right in.\u000a\u000aInstead, I went once again to the 24/7 Café.  I ordered their prime rib special that comes with vegetable and either mashed or loaded baked potato.  I ordered the beef extra rare and that's the way it came.  Sure, this place isn't Lawry's but the meat was excellent and the potato and broccoli were very good.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I got a piece of chocolate cake.  You can't ever pass that up.\u000a\u000aI removed one star from my 5 star earlier review because service wasn't that good.  When I first got there, the place was almost empty, and even then, I had to flag down servers for an iced tea refill.  Later when it was much busier, I still had to flag down the server to get my check.  It almost was a casino comp.

VI generally avoid this place, but I had to stop at the Great American Cookie Company and this was the closest.  \u000a\u000aParking is worse than ever because they're doing some renovation on the entrances and there are areas that are blocked off.  \u000a\u000aThere seemed to be a lot of tourists shopping which is very good.  Keep it up, Las Vegas visitors.  \u000a\u000aI'll only be back here when I really need to get to one of these stores - probably another three years.

VThis is a difficult review to write.  I had the $39.99 prix fixe tasting menu about which the Mirage has been sending me emails for a few months.  \u000a\u000aAll the food I had was excellent.  I had lobster tacos, the prime skirt steak, and the jelly donut munchkin holes for dessert.  These get high marks in my review.  The tacos were luscious--the guacamole served with them was excellent!  The skirt steak was served with two sauces that were also very well done.  The munchkin jelly donut holes were really tasty with or without the vanilla sauce that came with them.\u000a\u000aNow for the minuses.  I had no bread service.  Evidently, if you order from the prix fixe menu, there is no bread service.  I didn't notice this until I was almost finished with my steak, so I didn't bother to ask then.  The steak came with two thin waffle potato chips.  That's it--no side of any kind, not a carrot slice, one broccoli floret, nothing!  I found it amazing when the server suggested I might want to order a side so I had enough to eat.  I did order a side of mashed potatoes at $8.  That sort of negates the prix fixe of early dining.\u000a\u000aWhen I first arrived the waitress brought me a "new" prix fixe menu at $59.99 that I should consider as it would entail more food.  This is not on the Mirage website.  I did notice there was more food served including sides.  It seems to be a bait and switch scheme, but maybe no.\u000a\u000aI considered giving Stack a 2 rating but the food was all so good, I just couldn't.  I do know I won't be returning here.\u000a\u000aEdit:  You know, I have to give it a 2 star rating.  This just doesn't deserve 3 stars.  One star deleted.

VI'm going to agree with Oscar and give Neonopolis 4 stars for what it's becoming rather than for what it is now.  The place is no longer on life support and it shows many signs of life and the future looks brighter from the past years when a few restaurants and shops opened and quickly closed for lack of business.\u000a\u000aTelemundo coming and renting a good portion of the area for its studios was a boost.  The new Denny's is certainly a boost.  There is a new bar, Drink and Drag, that garners good reviews from the Yelp crew.  Finally, the new zip line ride is being constructed right in the middle of the place.  All these things point to renewed hope for the concept which never really made a go until now.\u000a\u000aThis morning, I had breakfast at the new Denny's.  I parked in the underground garage which is very, very handy!  One flight of stairs to walk up and I was there.  I was surprised when I got to the booth that there was no charge for the parking.  Their website says free parking with validation but Denny's doesn't validate.  Perhaps it was because I was less than an hour and it was a weekday morning.  Whatever the case, it was a nice bonus.  We are so spoiled by the free parking common in Las Vegas.\u000a\u000aI'll make a point of coming here more often.  I want to ride the new zip line when it's done.  Seems like it would make a good UYE.

VI decided to treat myself so i went to Verandah this morning for breakfast.  Even though our humidity is up due to the monsoon season, I opted to sit out on the patio.  While it was warm, it was not uncomfortable and much better than the cold main dining room.\u000a\u000aI got a glass of peach/guava juice that was quite good, a cup of coffee, and I ordered the Panettone French Toast.  The toast is topped with a banana pecan syrup and was trimmed with blackberries, blueberries, and a few raspberries.  The portion was just perfect given the sweetness of the topping.  \u000a\u000aService was exemplary!  They ask your name when you arrive, and from then on, everyone addresses you as Mr. and your name.  After I finished eating, a bus person came by and removed my plate, and I was left to sip my coffee and enjoy people watching as the ladies arrived at the pool not far from my table.\u000a\u000aI think I have to come back to try the citrus ricotta pancakes and enjoy the peaceful setting.

VMandalay Events Center is one of the two major venues for large scale concerts with a capacity of about 12,000 people.  I have seen several concerts here starting in 2001 shortly after moving to Las Vegas.\u000a\u000aI prefer this events center to the MGM Grand Garden because it's a bit more manageable in size which makes parking and leaving a bit easier.  There are plenty of concession areas and bathrooms.  The center is always kept clean.\u000a\u000aI have one problem with them and it's a problem with them and TicketMaster.  I had my electronic ticket on my iPhone but the woman scanning tickets in the line I was in didn't have the ability to scan the phone.  Come on--work with your partner TicketMaster.  This is 2014.  Get with it.  \u000a\u000aThe leg room is awful and the stairs going down the rows has different sizes.  As it turned out, the woman in front of me slipped and as I went to grab her from falling, we ended up sort of groping each other.  That ought to be worth a star of its own.  I think every arena is built this way.  There's a master blueprint somewhere that states this is the way it has to be and if you digress, the place will fall down.\u000a\u000aIn any case, I am a fan.  I'm not here often, but I do like seeing shows here.  I like the vibe of Mandalay Bay.

VWhen I visited the Shark Reef, I was a bit underwhelmed.  I expected much more.  The exhibits are interesting, and there are some very nice displays.  \u000a\u000aThe best part for me were the rays.  I enjoyed watching the visitors touch and then jump back.  The sharks were a yawn in a way.  They certainly are eye catching animals, and I found myself picking out one and following it as long as I could.\u000a\u000aThis is a do once if you're a local.  Make sure you show your Nevada ID for a discount.

VI came here today with a good friend from out of town who wanted some breakfast while he waited for some car servicing to be done.  He let me choose the place and this was it.  I've driven by a lot of times and never stopped.  That was changed today.\u000a\u000aWe were seated promptly and were served coffee and water promptly while we looked through their extensive menu done in the form of a tabloid newspaper.\u000a\u000aI got the Benedict's Garden, a vegetarian Eggs Benedict.  It came with English muffin halves on the bottom, then sliced grilled tomatoes, some avocado, and topped (the menu says smothered which is close) with Hollandaise.  There were potatoes and a side of some fresh fruit.  My friend got the Mexican omelette which was the special of the day.\u000a\u000aEverything was really good.  My eggs and the mixture of avocado and tomato with the Hollandaise was quite good.  The breakfast potatoes were really flavorful and the small slice of canteloupe and fresh pineapple was like having a dessert at breakfast.  My friend thought his omelette was one of the best he has had.  Be prepared for a large breakfast.  The omelettes are listed as four eggs.\u000a\u000aWe chatted and passed a considerable amount of time.  Service was fast and cheerful.  It was a good way to start the day.

VThis is really a great show and is very kid friendly!  Popovich has gotten his animals from shelters in Las Vegas and he trains them for his show.  The things he gets cats to do are amazing and I had a big smile almost the entire show during the two times I saw this show.\u000a\u000aThere is some juggling in the show and his daughter does some parts of the show, too.\u000a\u000aI really enjoyed the show and I'd certainly recommend it to anyone who is an animal lover.

VI toured the Atomic Testing Museum for the second time yesterday and there still is much I haven't seen.  There are so many terminals with various videos of the atomic testing era.  Also, the display in some of the cases take a great amount of time to get through if you read what each item is and where it was obtained.\u000a\u000aSince I grew up in the testing era, I remember many of the things shown here.  I also remember watching a live test from Nevada on the Today Show back in the 1950s so this museum is especially compelling.\u000a\u000aIt is not a large place, but it is so compact and laid out nicely that there is a lot of pieces displayed in a small area.  The museum also means more to me because I took the Department of Energy's tour of the Test Site and say the Sedan Crater and others in person.\u000a\u000aThis is a great place to spend as many hours as you want.  It's historical impact is great indeed!

VThis update is going to be more meaningful for locals.  \u000a\u000aI got an annual membership for the museum and tonight I attended my first program at  the museum.  Reception was at 6 PM and the program started at 6:30.  The reception consisted of beer, wine, water, taquitos, quesadilla, and some large chocolate chip cookies.  \u000a\u000aThe program was in two parts but they dealt with some of the same information.  Col. Peck (ret.) was involved in the program to use the MiGs this country obtained from defectors and use them to train our pilots in fighter pilot training.  T. D. Barnes (ret.) was a CIA employee who was involved in the reverse engineering of these planes.  He led teams that took the planes apart to see how they were built and of what and then put them back together.\u000a\u000aTheir stories were fascinating and they gave me information I never knew before.  The museum director said there was a full line up of programs slated for the year.  I look forward to them.\u000a\u000aIndividual membership is $50 per year and it comes with some benefits.  If you are not a member, the cost of the program was $20.  It pays for itself!  \u000a\u000aThe history of the Cold War and beyond becomes more known as more of the information is declassified.

VThis was definitely heading for a 3 to 3.5 star review while I was eating.  Then the service really went down hill.  They became quite busy early, but we got there at 5 when they opened.  Ordering was pretty prompt - it should have been faster with the fewer people then, but it got worse.\u000a\u000aI had the Southwestern chicken salad.  It was really good.  Lettuce with chopped tomatoes, cheese, some tortilla strips, and best of all, lots of jalapeno slices mixed in with the dressing.  It gave the salad zing, and it was really good.  My wife had an omelet, and she enjoyed that although he didn't order a side of bacon.  Rather, she gotten bacon pieces mixed in her omelet.  He also forgot to order the guacamole.\u000a\u000aI did have a fantastic dessert - the mile high chocolate cake.  I posted a photo of it.  This soothed my feelings for awhile.\u000a\u000aAfter our meal, the waiter didn't bring the check.  After 15 minutes he finally appeared, but he forgot to remove the amount of my comp.  Then he was gone for another 10 minutes with my credit card before reappeared with the corrected tab and my card.\u000a\u000aI have had some good meals at this coffee shop including tonight, but service was lacking so much that it comes in between 1.5 and 2 stars so I'll round up.

VI had a comp for HIgh Tea at the Petrossian Bar at the Bellagio and went this afternoon.  High tea was something I've wanted to do for a long time but my wife was not interested and some other people I spoke to about going were not enthusiastic.  "Meh" was a common word.  OK then, I'll go myself.  Playing myVegas on Facebook, I earned enough points to redeem for the High Tea for one.\u000a\u000aI made a reservation for 2 PM.  I went to the mLife club at about 1:15 and after giving her my confirmation number, I had my comp and had time to walk around the Bellagio and watch tourists.  It's great people watching.\u000a\u000aAt 1:55, I went to the podium at the entrance to the Petrossian, she checked her roster and saw I had a reservation, and she took me to a table that had been set up for one.  She gave me the menu, a quick explanation, and said my server would be by soon.\u000a\u000aThe rules, if you will, are each person gets to choose four finger and/or open faced sandwiches.  Each person gets two scones and three mini pastries.  And of course, there's the tea which you pick from a selection on the next page in the menu.   For sandwiches, I ordered (1) Smoked turkey, brie, and black grapes on a cranberry bread; (2) chickpea panella, roasted red pepper, green olive mayo on spiced bread; (3) Alaskan king crab and avocado on brioche; and (4) Smoked salmon topped with Transmontanous Oscietra caviar on pumpernickel bread.  (descriptions are from the menu).  My favorite was the smoked turkey.  The cranberry bread was very tasty.  All four made good bites and had good flavors.\u000a\u000aThere were two cranberry scones and with the scones came three mini containers with clotted cream, butter, and lemon curd.  These were for use with the scones.  The scones were luscious.  They were much better than you get at coffee stores.  Very fresh, very high in butter content, and baked perfectly.  I didn't use any of the butter.  I tried the clotted cream and the lemon curd.  Hands down, the lemon curd was a winner!\u000a\u000aThe three small pastries were nice to help fill me up. The best of these was a small chocolate, custard tart that had a chocolate coffee bean in shape and taste on top.  This was the winner of this bunch.   For tea, I chose the loose leaf Darjeeling.  \u000a\u000aMy server, Mary Ann, was very pleasant and came around and poured more hot water into my teapot and I was able to sit after the sandwiches and pastries and enjoy the Bellagio again watching tourists go by.\u000a\u000aA few things about the experience.  Even though they have the live pianist, where I was seated, it's enough distance away that it was not so easy to hear them play.  The casino music easily drowned out the pianist but that didn't spoil anything--that's just an observation. Second, men's fingers are not built for tea cups like this.  I don't expect a diner type coffee cup, but to pick up my cup, I look like I had just come in from the barn and was sitting down to have some of ma's good tea.  \u000a\u000aI'm glad I had the comp.  At $35 per person plus tax, I may not have done it on my own.  It is something one should do just for the experience.  Go with friends and chat and laugh and share and I think it would be a lot more fun.

VIt's been a couple of years since we've been here and decided it was time to go back.  I love the spice mixture and ground salt they have with olive oil for dipping the bread pieces.  It's very tasty and I end up eat too many pieces of bread.  Maybe that's why we come infrequently.\u000a\u000aWe each had a cup of soup for our start.  I had the Italian noodle soup and my wife had the lentil with sausage soup.  Both were good and different from soups we normally are offered. \u000a\u000aFor the main course, I chose the Chicken Bryan, a grilled chicken breast with goat cheese, sun dried tomatoes, and a lemon basin sauce.  My wife had Chicken Marsala.  Both were very good and I have some Chicken Marsala for lunch tomorrow. For our sides, I took the garlic mashed potatoes and my wife had asparagus.  Good accompaniments.\u000a\u000aWe chose to share a dessert--the chocolate dream.  It's a double fudge brownie with chocolate mousse, chocolate sauce, some Kahlua on the brownie, and whipped cream.  It was superb!  I'd go back just for that.  \u000a\u000aService was excellent.  Our server was attentive, prompt, and very personable.  We will be returning sooner than the years that passed since our last visit.

VI had breakfast here this morning.  The raspberry brioche French toast.  It was quite good.  I got a side of sausage links.  Service was excellent.  My server, Myung, a.k.a. Cindy, was very efficient, pleasant, and helpful.  I had three items chosen as possibles and I asked her for a recommendation and she told me to get the raspberry brioche French toast.  She was right.\u000a\u000aSince I was there early, I was seated immediately.  I was alone, so I sat at the counter, but it was a relaxed breakfast.

VI met a friend from Canada for dinner at Ping Pang Pong tonight.  My only other dining experience here was with the same friend about 4 years ago.\u000a\u000aWe ordered three dishes to share:  The Singapore rice noodles were excellent.  There was a fair number of shrimp and some small slices of pork along with onions.  The curry flavor was good.  For my taste, I could have used a bit more.  We got an order of wrinkled green beans.  I don't think they were seared as much as they should have been to make them wrinkled.  They were crisp.  Their flavor was very good.  Finally, we got the half roasted Cantonese duck.  The flavor of the duck was a winner, too!  I'm not a big fan of duck when it's on the bone, but this was cooked well.  \u000a\u000aService was good.  My iced tea refilled often without asking.  We did have to ask a server to bring us some clean plates so we could get rid of some of the duck bones.  \u000a\u000aThe one drawback of Ping Pang Pong was the loudness of the place for the first 1/3 of the hour and a half we were there.  It was so noisy from people talking loudly and the kitchen staff, filling orders for take out and yelling the orders to each other.\u000a\u000aI do like the place and I will be back if only for the Singapore noodles.  That was my highlight of the meal!\u000a\u000aPS:  I love the name.  I can't help think of Puccini and Turandot!  Addio amore, addio razza....

VI have seen Phantom, the Las Vegas Spectacular 4 times.  Before the production here, I saw Phantom in both Toronto and New York.  This is by far the best production.\u000a\u000aThe theatre is exquisite with every detail of its design well conceived and executed!  The "Eternal Audience" is a brilliant device to gather you into the opera house mystique. The costumes are wonderful and have been kept in great shape during the run.\u000a\u000aThe cast, though it changes from time to time, is really good.  The Phantoms have all been very credible tenors, and the current Christines do a fantastic job.  \u000a\u000aAdd in the pyrotechnics and you have a recipe for a spectacular night of theatre.  My only complaint about the show was the speed up of the orchestra.  When I see the show, I wanted to applaud more, but the conductor moves the orchestra along and cuts off some of the applause so as to stay in their time constraints.\u000a\u000aAs for seating recommendations, I always sit in the Gold Circle.  While the chandelier scenes are above and behind me, I can turn around for that period of time.  The action I care for most is on the stage.  That's why I got a front row seat the last time I saw the show.  I also attended Phantom Phans Week in 2009 and had the chance to get behind the scenes information and see the chandelier put together slowly, without music and with the lights in the theatre fully lit.  Then they returned the chandelier to the stage and redid the opening chandelier scene in the dark and with the music.  Sublime!

VIt's been since 2007 that I last saw Fantasy and I went back to see the show in its current form.  Fantasy remains one of those well done topless reviews on the Las Vegas Strip.  The format has remained the same--the entertainers have changed.\u000a\u000aLorena Peril is leaving the show soon and she did not sing last night.  I did have the good fortune to see her at the Shimmer Cabaret in Sin City Bad Girls a few years ago so I wasn't disappointed.  The woman who sang last night was Lily, and she had a terrific voice.\u000a\u000aAnother change, Sean E. Cooper was not in the show last night.  There was a female comic who did a few short pieces that were very funny.  I believe she was the same comic who opened for Carrot Top when I recently saw him.\u000a\u000aThe show is very well done!  The ladies are very beautiful, their dancing is quite good, and their moves are suggestive enough to be titillating and should not be offensive to anyone.\u000a\u000aThe show runs just about 65 minutes and it's one of those great Las Vegas shows that are a must see when you want a change of pace from Cirque.

VThis was my 4th year attending CES and I enjoy it every year.  There seemed to be a bit more pizzazz this year than the last two, and it was good to see.  Some of the booth babes were eye catchers, for sure!\u000a\u000aI am enough of a techie to enjoy seeing and fondling, if necessary, the latest in gadgets both large and small.  \u000a\u000aOne needs to do the show in a smartly.   Start early, take regular breaks, and concentrate on smaller areas rather than trying to sweep through the North to South sections of the Convention Center in one swoop.\u000a\u000aI always park at a hotel parking garage on the south end of the Strip and ride the monorail to the CC.  The $1 each way fare is great, and there's no hassle with paying for parking or getting in a jam of cabs or shuttle busses.

V**** Review is for Summer Restaurant Week 2013 Menu ****\u000a\u000aA friend joined me here for dinner last night before the Human Nature Show and we both ordered from the Restaurant Week menu.  For the first course, my friend ordered the Satay chicken with peanut sauce.  I got the "crunchy spicy yellowtail roll with spicy mayonnaise." We both enjoyed our dishes.  We didn't try each others dishes because Paula doesn't eat sushi and satay chicken is just satay chicken.  I did try the peanut sauce and it was good.\u000a\u000aFor course two, Paula got the roasted Thai Buddha chicken with choy sum, sweet chili, and lime.  I got the filet mignon pepper steak with shitake mushroom, bell pepper, and shishito peppers.  I did have some of the Buddha chicken and it was very tender and the sauce was excellent.  The pepper steak was very good.  The filet was sliced and barely stir fried with the vegetables.  The stand out was the sauce again!  It was rich and very flavorful.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, we again took different paths.  Paula got the crispy Fuji apple blossoms with Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream and I got the chocolate spring rolls\u000a with Kalamansi dipping sauce.  The rolls were good but they weren't stuffed with chocolate as I hoped they would be.  Rather, there was some melted chocolate on a leaf and the rolls were placed on the chocolate.  Regardless, they were good.  The dipping sauce was non-descript.  I really couldn't say it had much of a flavor.  It tasted more like mango than orange.  For Paula's apple blossoms, they were triangle puff pastries with apple filling.  They were good.\u000a\u000aService was very good.  My iced tea was refilled when it got halfway down.  The table was bussed quickly.  Our server was very pleasant and he was pleased to know there was at least one local having dinner at Tao.\u000a\u000aThe room is quite nice.  Dark and woody with a large Buddha in the center along one wall.  We got our cameras/phones out so we could get a photo of it.  It would be a good place to take a date if you wanted to impress.\u000a\u000aI can only can fit in two places for this Restaurant Week, and I'm glad Tao was one of them!

VReview is for casino only:  Some of the VP machines are a bit old fashioned.  \u000a\u000aThe one thing I really like about the place is how they have preserved some historic pieces of art/architecture.  For example, one of the chandeliers is from a Paris opera house, bronze doors and facade from the Kuwait Royal Bank, and doors from the Pullman Mansion.  This is only a small list.  You can go to the hotel area or slot club and get a brochure which describes them and tells where they are.

VI am truly fascinated with this exhibit.  The bodies on display with the different body systems is very educational.  As a person who hated science in school, I find this kind of science to be entertaining and educational.\u000a\u000aTo see the arteries and veins in different parts of the body with the rest dissolved is incredible.  It really helps one understand how it all goes together.\u000a\u000aThis is an exhibit I'd recommend to anyone.  Since MGM Resorts is having a special, experience 3 attractions for $54, you can see these two and throw in the CSI Experience at the MGM Grand itself.  It's a nice savings.

VI went to the Secret Garden today to see the White Tiger Cubs that were brought to Las Vegas to be raised in this program.  The are Mohan and Majestic and they can be quite playful!  Here are links to my YouTube videos:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=075IVr3aI5g\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_CMTK8Xyqg\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DFKFo1pcEc\u000a\u000aWhile waiting for them to be brought to their nursery, I walked around and saw the white lions. white tigers, a black leopard, one spotted leopard, some Alpacas, and two snow leopards.\u000a\u000aIt's not a large area, but it's a pretty place to take your time, watch the animals, sit and chat for awhile, and just enjoy the wonderful desert air!  Entrance fee is $15 for adults, so be warned that it's not a cheap visit for this small area.\u000a\u000aIt won't take me 8 years before I come back here again as it did between my first visit and this one.

VI saw this show a few years ago.  There were a few illusions that I really liked and scratched my head and wondered how.  For the most part however, I found the show somewhat boring.   I also immensely dislike ANY performer who needs to have his parents stand up and get applause.  In this case, Copperfield's parents were in the audience.  They deserved as much applause as I did for sitting through the show.\u000a\u000aThere was one illusion--and I know that's what it is--illusion, but it was totally ruined for me.  It's the locked box one where he predicts before the show what random people will say as a number.  I know the box is switched.  I don't know how, but when you do an illusion and you have someone write down numbers that get put in the box in the switch, have them write the numbers the same way you do, David.  Make sure you don't write 4 like that and the other person backstage write it the more common way we almost all write a four.  This error just ruined the whole thing for me and I walked away shaking my head wondering why I had wasted my money on this show.

VI stopped in at Jerry's for breakfast this morning.  I haven't been here since the 1980s.  In walking through the casino, I was surprised at how much nicer it seemed to me than it did years ago.  Since it was morning, ti wasn't very crowded with people at slots and there wasn;t a lot of smoke to bother me.\u000a\u000aI looked at the menu carefully, checked the Yelp reviews, and then ordered huevos rancheros.  I got the eggs over easy and I opted for corn tortillas.  Jerry's was very quiet.  In a short time, my breakfast was brought.  When I ordered, my server asked if I wanted mild or hot salsa.  I chose the hot.  Jerry's doesn't know hot salsa unless someone put the wrong salsa in the small dish she brought.  \u000a\u000aThere was a large serving of refried beans with some taco chips in the beans.  The eggs were done correctly and the entire dish was covered in chopped fresh tomatoes and lettuce shreds.\u000a\u000aMy server, Mamie, was very pleasant and competent.  She was back quickly with the coffee pot to refill my cup.  The breakfast was large, very filling, and good but there was nothing that would make this stand out above other huevos rancheros I've had.\u000a\u000aI would like to go back sometime in the afternoon and get their strawberry ring for dinner.  It looked so good in the front case as did many of the other pastries including GIANT eclairs.\u000a\u000aJerry's is A-OK!

VThis was the second time I ate at Terra Rossa.  Had I been doing Yelp reviews the first time I was here, the number of stars would be less than this review.  I came here with friends from out of town who are staying at Red Rock.\u000a\u000aWe got started with some rolls and a plate of cheese, zucchini crisps, and olives.  Some of our party wanted bread instead of the oil/balsamic dip and that was brought also.  One odd things was that when we said we didn't want to see a wine list, the wine glasses were removed but we were never asked about anything else to drink.  Instead we were served tap water which was fine but i do like iced tea with any meal.\u000a\u000aI was the only one who ordered an appetizer.  I got their tortellini in brodo, chicken tortellini in chicken broth with parmigiano reggiano cheese.  In addition, a server added some freshly ground pepper and some extra cheese.  The soup was very hot and was very, very good!\u000a\u000aFor my main course, I got the ravioli di spinach, ravioli stuffed with spinach, ricotta, brown butter, and sage.  This, too, had extra cheese grated as I requested.  There were five good sized ravioli and the filling of spinach and cheese was quite good.  The brown butter made the dish even better tasting.  \u000a\u000aAround the table, one person got spaghetti, one got veal parmigiana, and one got something I can't remember.  All 4 of us were pleased with our meals.  Being Super Bowl Sunday and the game was in progress, we had the restaurant to ourselves except for one other table.  \u000a\u000aService was excellent!  I'm glad I came back and gave the place a second look even if it has been at least 5 years since I was here.  I guess some things do get better with age!

VAs part of an unofficial Yelp event. we came here to say goodbye to the Sahara which is closing in the middle of May.  I got the all day pass for $14.99, but I only had time for two rides.  That gave me a good fix.\u000a\u000aI've ridden Speed before and I like it a lot.  It goes quickly and is done quickly, too!   That's why the all day pass is great.  Now, they are only running the ride every 15 minutes so you have time for a drink or bathroom break while you wait.\u000a\u000aI am coming back in 2 weeks when the kids go back to school from spring break and then I'll get the full value out of my all day pass.\u000a\u000aIf you're a local, ride it while you can!

VI've never been a DMV hater as many people I know have been.  All you need to do is take a book or your smartphone with Angry Birds on it and off you go.\u000a\u000aI like the way Nevada DMV has put the self-serve kiosks around the city including at the AAA office in Summerlin.  Renewing your registration is very easy.  Get your car smogged, go to the kiosk, scan your postcard, pay, and then walk out with your new plate sticker.  Done!\u000a\u000aWith a new car, you have to show up at DMV or pay someone to wait in line for you.  It's no big deal!  I went in to this Flamingo Office today and my number was 445.  They were waiting on customer 370 something when I got there.  Even so, I was out of the office with the new car registered and the plate transferred in less than an hour.\u000a\u000aNot bad DMV.  Keep up the good work.  Oh, and by the way, come up with a way that this one thing could also be done electronically.  You have all the information.  Let's just go from there.

VHow often do you get to be a pastry chef for awhile at a nice restaurant? Well I was one tonight.   More on that later.\u000a\u000aWe always overlook going to Nove because of its out of the way location so it was on our must try list and was it a good decision.\u000a\u000aWe were brought iced teas quickly and they were refilled often during the night.  Then came bread service.  It was three kinds--cheese bread sticks, focaccia, and Italian bread.  We also got a dish with three potential bread toppings and for use during the meal--one container with olive oil, one with red pepper flakes, and one with grated cheese.\u000a\u000aOne of the runners brought us an amuse-bouche--two small bruschetta with freshly chopped tomatoes.  A nice palate awakener for what was to come.\u000a\u000aFor a starter, we order their salumi plate.  Our server, Alex, assured us it could be shared by two people.  The menu said that it was a selection of cured meats and red pizza.  Well, that sounded fine.  What came was almost a meal in itself.  Four kinds of cured meat, parmigiano cheese, and some fresh ricotta.  That wooden server was placed in front of us and then they placed a wood plate with red pizza.  Wow!  So much!  \u000a\u000aCured meat platter:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#rfBs4_87H9DVi5r3o0E_9A\u000a\u000aRed Pizza:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#a_Kw4-9-qjX9ROujm1IhHg\u000a\u000aWe also had another three compartment dish with mustard, olives, and pickled vegetables.  This was really starting to add up in the stomach and we hadn't gotten to the main course.  Everything was excellent.  We had to let two small pieces of pizza go back with the dishes.\u000a\u000aFor the main course, my wife got the Veal Nove which the menu describes as thinly sliced Scaloppine, Prosciutto, Arugula, and Lemon.  I tried a small piece and it was very, very good.  I ordered a special--lobster ravioli with a seafood sauce similar to lobster bisque.  It was superb!  There was a small amount of veal leftover and Alex and his crew quickly boxed it for bringing home.\u000a\u000aNow comes my pastry chef experience.  One of their desserts is Make Your Own Cannoli.  You get 5 small sized shells, a small, plastic pastry bag filled with the luscious cream that goes inside the cannoli, and a dish with nine compartments for dipping the ends of the cannoli.  The compartments had raspberry sauce, chocolate syrup, chocolate chips, coconut, butterscotch, toffee, pistachio, and chopped peanuts.  If you're counting and only got 8, it's because two of the wells had raspberry syrup.  \u000a\u000aTubes and pastry bag:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#sq32kg1eMJezCQzW7W2dTg\u000a\u000aDipping dish:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#uKRzAlaK3OKmX0AXS_L4cA\u000a\u000aLike my Yelp friends who work at Jean Philippe at Aria, I wielded that pastry bag like a surgeon uses his scalpel.  In no time whatsoever, I had completed my first cannoli with one side dipped in raspberry.\u000a\u000aSuccess:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#YFbqugc1i6Yt0wd4ibBihw\u000a\u000aMy wife, who hasn't been a fan of cannoli before tonight, ate three of them which left me with just two and I did all the work myself.  That's gratitude I'll tell you.  That dessert was fun and it's a clever menu item!\u000a\u000aService was excellent!  Alex and crew were always there to help, removed dirty plates, chat a bit, and do everything as well as they could which was very good!\u000a\u000aThe view, while not as good as Alizé, is not bad.  I had a view of the original Palms Tower and being a local, I was studying the streets to figure out where the things in the area I know were located.\u000a\u000aThis was a very pleasant dinner!  I know I'll be back!  Oh, and I'll be calling Jean Philippe in the morning to check about pastry chef openings.

VI haven't been to the buffet at the Mirage since before it was renovated and renamed Cravings.  I joined a friend from out of town tonight for dinner.\u000a\u000aWe were pleased with our dinner.  The design is so much more friendly than the old set up.  The only thing I thought was that the seating looked almost like diner seats but that didn't matter.\u000a\u000aThere is a wide variety of stations from which to choose.There are: Italian, carving, Rotisserie, Latin, Raw Bar, Fishmonger, Noodles, Chinese, Salad, and Desserts.  Those are the names on the lights at each of the areas.\u000a\u000aStandouts tonight were the asparagus, lobster bisque soup--better than what I had recently at a high end Strip restaurant, the ravioli, and the desserts.  I mark them down because their prime rib that was supposed to be rare was more medium than rare even though she cut into a new piece.  I could have told her to cut in the middle, but she took from the end.\u000a\u000aThe dessert selection was nice.  I had some red velvet cake, a cookie, and the newest serving idea--a chocolate shaped mini tea/coffee cup filled with chocolate mousse and topped with whipped cream.\u000a\u000aService was very good.  In fact I had to stop her from refilling my iced tea so many times because I was going to a show and I didn't want to have to leave in the middle for a bathroom break.\u000a\u000aThe buffet is priced a little less than the highest rated ones and I can see why.  I can see myself coming back sometime.

VFriends from out of town who were staying at The Hotel asked me to join them for dinner at the Bayside Buffet.  I had been here once before many years ago, and I remembered it as being a good, solid place.  It's pretty much the same now.\u000a\u000aAmong some of the things I tires, the Chinese broccoli with lots of garlic was outstanding.  The BBQ chicken pizza was good, too.  The prime rib was standard and was much of the other things I tried from the buffet.  There were no gourmet dishes but there was nothing that was bad.\u000a\u000aThey have free wine and beer with dinner which may be a plus for some people.  One of my friends did not care for the wine she got but she and her husband were pleased with the buffet also,\u000a\u000aI think the place it was lacking was at the dessert area.  I ended up with two chocolate cakes and a raspberry cake.  The two raspberry and square chocolate cakes were OK but the chocolate cake cut like a pie wedge was outstanding!  It was quite rich--almost decadent.\u000a\u000aI'd recommend this place for someone who's staying at Mandalay Bay, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.  There are better buffet options available on the Strip but at a few dollars more for the most part.

VBefore my show last night, I had dinner at Rao's, something that had been on my radar for awhile.  I made a reservation for 5 PM so I had lots of time for a leisurely meal before the 7:30 show.\u000a\u000aI was greeted promptly and taken to a table on the far side of the bar and down a few steps.  It's the last area before you go to their patio.  I had a view of the pool area and one of Caesars iconic Roman statues in a columned structure.\u000a\u000aMy server, Howard, quickly appeared and asked for my drink order.  He brought my iced tea quickly.  Having read about the size of Rao's portion, I was careful to choose wisely.  I went with the baked clams for an appetizer and the ravioli purses for the main course.\u000a\u000aI was soon brought a nice bread basket.  Howard asked me if I wanted some balsamic with the olive oil and I declined.  I poured some of the oil onto the plate, salted it a bit, and then dipped some of the olive bread that was part of the basket.\u000a\u000aWithin a short time, my baked clams were delivered.  They are littleneck clams that had an oregano bread crumb topping.  I squeezed some lemon on the clams and dug in.  It's been a long time since I got baked clams and they were great!  The lemon mixed with the juices from the clams and I had another dipping "sauce" for my bread.  Very tasty!\u000a\u000aThe main course came. Rao's calls them beggar purse ravioli.  The ravioli were stuffed with a mixture of pear and ricotta cheese and they were in a sauce of brown butter seasoned with sage and topped with dried cranberries.  This caught my eye when I was reading the menu because it was such a different dish.  It was excellent, too!  The pear taste with the cheese was very mild and the butter with the dried cranberries was a true winner!  A good dish that's really different.  Also, I had dipping sauce #3--the brown butter with sage was a wonderful place to dip a few cubes of the good bread.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I asked Howard for his advice.  He gave me a listing of the entire dessert menu without having to bring one to me.  Of the things on the menu, he recommended one, the peanut butter tart, something his wife makes--she's one of the pastry chefs at Rao's.  The tart had a graham cracker crust, a layer of chocolate ganache, and it was topped with peanut butter mousse.  It was superb!  I'll have the other dessert he recommended on my next visit.\u000a\u000aThe dinner was very very good!  Service was exemplary.  The staff or Howard was always around to refill water, get more iced tea, remove dirty dishes, and simply to do a great job!  I am a big fan of Rao's.

V4.5 stars\u000a\u000aReview is for the Restaurant Week 2011 menu:\u000a\u000aThis was the first time I was at Vintner Grill even though it's only about a mile from where I live.  I decided to give the place a try with its Restaurant Week menu and I was not disappointed.\u000a\u000aCourse 1 was crispy calamari with a lemon and curry aioli and some haricot verts.  The calamari was cooked perfectly and I liked that besides rings they had tentacles mixed in.  The lemon and curry aioli was a very tasty dipping sauce.  5/5\u000a\u000aCourse 2 was veal scaloppini with crimini mushrooms, lemon, marsala and capellini with olive oil.  The marsala sauce was superb in its richness and the crimini mushrooms added god flavor.  The capellini was a bit bland.  It needed some salt and for my taste a bit of grated cheese to bring out the richness of the olive oil.  4.5/5\u000a\u000aCourse 3 was a dessert of a gorgonzola panna cotta with a cherry compote and some sesame tuile.  The panna cotta was very light as it should be and had a mild flavor.  The cherry compote paired well with the lightness of the panna cotta.  The tuile was placed across the plate in the panna cotta.  Presentation was quite nice.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant is beautifully decorated.  I appreciate the fact that they start dinner service at 4.  I had a reservation for 4:30 as I needed to eat, run home and put my shorts back on, and head to a play at Spring Mountain Ranch State Park.  Service was excellent.  My server was polite and efficient.  The music loop was more for gray hairs like me.  The place was quiet, but it was early and there weren't many diners yet.  I do wish we could dispense with the TVs at the bar, but this is Las Vegas and almost any bar needs one or more TVs.

VThe food was excellent, the service less so hence only 3 stars.  I ordered the Porcini rubbed filet and my wife ordered the Lite filet.  My steak was 8 ounces and hers was 6 ounces.  Mine came with asparagus--3 spears and hers came with Fleming's potatoes.  I ordered mine black and blue and she ordered hers medium.  Both were cooked perfectly and were delicious.  I didn't taste any porcini from the porcini rub.\u000a\u000aI thought there'd be more than 3 asparagus spears so I didn't order an extra side and the small amount of Fleming's potatoes was fine for my wife.  \u000a\u000aWe were started with a nice breadbasket with two kinds of flavored butters.  I didn't overdo the bread because I wanted to enjoy the steak and to have some room for dessert.  When we ordered our meal, the server informed us they needed 10 minutes to prepare the chocolate lava cake if we opted for that for dessert.\u000a\u000aPart way through our meal, the server stopped by and asked if she should put in an order for the lava cake.  I thought it was a bit early, and should have declined at that time, but instead I trusted her knowledge.  I am a fast eater, my wife is a tortoise.\u000a\u000aAnother server brought the dessert to the table just as my wife put down her fork from her meal.  When this other person saw the table hadn't yet been cleared, she took the cake back to the kitchen and placed it on a shelf.  She then came back and cleared the table, went back to the kitchen, and returned with the dessert with its now melting ice cream.  Also, they failed the sweetener packet test miserably!\u000a\u000aWhen you're paying as much for your meal as you do at Fleming's, you expect good if not excellent service.  This simply wasn't good service.  I would give this place a 2 star rating based on just the service, but the steaks were so good I raised it to three.  It was OK if not A--OK.  \u000a\u000aWith all the good steakhouses in this city, I won't be returning even though it's close to where I live.

VI went here last night and was really disappointed in the whole experience vis à vis the price and the surroundings.  First, it's a beautifully done restaurant with a nice gas fireplace and elegant surroundings.  That comes with a fatal error.  There is a glass wall that separates this lovely dining room from the bar and several large TVs all tuned to basketball.  Can't you put some drapes on the glass and keep the dining room a dining room?  One other thing, it would be nice if you used real candles instead of those cheap plastic battery operated ones.  Goodness knows your profit margin on each steak would allow that.\u000a\u000aAs for the food, it is very over-priced.  Total bill for 1 person before tip was just under $80.  That was for 1 iced tea, a bowl of French onion soup, an 8 ounce filet mignon, a side of fingerling potatoes cooked in duck fat with thyme, and chocolate bread pudding.  That's it.\u000a\u000aThe bread basket had a nice selection with a slice each of olive, raisin, and sourdough bread, a pretzel roll, and one lavash.  The onion soup was standard.  It wasn't a rich tasting broth but standard.  My server didn't understand "blue" so I said black and blue and then he responded with Pittsburgh style, and I said yes.  The steak was more medium rare than extra rare as it should have been.  The potatoes were much ado about little.  The bread pudding was excellent.  Service was quite good with several people seeing to more iced tea or checking on my dinner.\u000a\u000aI recently had a 5 course chef's tasting menu at a steakhouse at a Strip hotel and it was only a few dollars more and it included an 8 pounce American Wagyu filet.  I guess my expectations for t-Bones were simply too high.  It just doesn't produce a meal that merits the prices they charge.  It's a shame when you walk away from a pricey dinner and you remember the bread basket and the dessert.\u000a\u000aI should have listened to Holly!

VAfter leaving the show I attended last night, I was walking back to the garage when I noticed the giant Coke bottle on the Boulevard.  I'm a devoted Coke person so I decided to check the place out and get a drink.  I walked around and looked at all the gifts that are Coke themed.\u000a\u000aI bought a small metal bottle of Diet Coke and was on my way.  After reading the reviews of friends, I need to go back and go to the fountain area upstairs and do one of the tastings.\u000a\u000aThis is a definite do over.  The only downside was paying Strip prices at Coca-Cola World for a small bottle.  One of the other places nearby would have been less expensive, but then I wouldn't have seen all the Coke stuff available for sale.\u000a\u000aSince I don't get to Atlanta very often--the last time was 1993--I'll settle for this Coke World right here in my hometown!

VOver the years, this coffee shop has been all over the place.  I once vowed I'd never return.  Now that it's no longer Coco's, we stayed for dinner.\u000a\u000aI had the chicken Cobb salad and my wife had a turkey sandwich on sourdough.  Both meals were very good and we had very good service.  They've gone up in my estimation and we'll probably return.  It was nice to go somewhere different.

VReview for showroom only:\u000a\u000aI have been to the Aruba's showroom 3 or 4 times. It's a small venue but the right size for a small production.  Last night when I went to see Strip the Play, the rooms was set up with approximately 40 chairs.  In addition, there were 5 or 6 round tables with two chairs in the front row and some booth seating on the sides.\u000a\u000a The place needs a little renovating.

VI ran in here quickly tonight to get some half and half and berries I had forgotten to get when I was shopping.  It was near closing, and one set of doors was locked.  Only a small inconvenience.\u000a\u000aSince I wasn't looking for much fresh produce, almost their raison d'etre, my rating is not as high as it might be if I was buying fruits and vegetables.\u000aThe produce looked good, but it was only a cursory glance as I was on my way home from a show and I wasn't doing shopping for more than a few items.\u000a\u000aI found what I needed, looked at a couple other items, and then went to check out.  There, I heard a woman tell an employee about being bothered by a panhandler in the parking lot.  The employee checked the parking lot and he assured her no one was there now.\u000a\u000aI offered to walk her to her car and I waited while she got in and then drove away.  The location can be iffy for a woman at night.  The place is a bit pricey, too!  If I pay these prices, I want to be shopping at Whole Foods in Summerlin.

VI went to the Orleans Arena today to see the Lingerie Bowl IX between the Los Angeles Temptation and the Philadelphia Passion.  \u000a\u000aThis arena is a perfect size for this kind of medium sized event.  There is plenty of parking between the East and West lots and the Orleans Hotel and Casino's garage.  Going to/from the casino is quite easy with the moving sidewalks, and going to any of the parking areas is a snap.\u000a\u000aThe arena is kept looking new with good maintenance.  One of my favorite things to do is go out on the viewing area on the east side of the arena and just look at the Strip hotels--especially at night.  There are a number of bathrooms available in several areas.\u000a\u000aIn short, this arena is certainly a great asset to Las Vegas for basketball, arena football, and special events like ice skating shows and concerts.

VWe had an exchange student from France at our high school whose favorite top compliment was "formidable!"  You'd have to hear her say this with her delightful accent.  For my meal at Guy Savoy, I often thought of Christelle and silently said "formidable!"\u000a\u000aI got the Signature Menu, a multi-course meal of wonderfully prepared and plated food.  Dinner started with what could be called 3 amuse-bouches although only one was called the amuse-bouche.  Shortly after getting comfortable, a server brings you a metal skewer of foie-gras with black truffle.  In a bit, you're brought another morsel, a 2 piece waffle with parmesan cheese.  Then the "official" amuse-bouche arrives.  It's a small cup of zucchini soup with some pine nuts.  You brush the nuts into the soup.  My server, Kriste, suggested I check under the cup when I was done for something else.  Sure enough, there was a small piece of pork belly to enjoy when the main part was finished.\u000a\u000aThe first course was the chestnut course.  There was chestnut purée, small whole chestnuts, sliced mushrooms, and chestnut soup.  It was marvelous.  I haven't eaten chestnuts since I was a teen.  \u000a\u000aThe second course was called the Colors of Caviar--layers of caviar in different forms topped by a layer of caviar sabayon.  A server suggested inserting the flat spoon all the way down and getting some of each layer.  Very nice!\u000a\u000aDuring this time, I had one piece of lemon bread from the bread cart.  You're automatically brought two pieces of bread after being seated and I didn't want to fill up on bread.  I have to go again and try the sea weed bread.  They had a very nice selection.\u000a\u000aCourse three was whole stuffed red mullet.  The head of the fish was discretely covered by a leaf of cooked spinach. The fish was stuffed with very thinly sliced mushrooms and spinach.  It was extraordinary!\u000a\u000aCourse four was Foie-gras with a bitter infusion.  They bring a glass tea pot with a candle to your table.  In the tea pot, green tea is placed and consomée is added.  The foie-gras is prepared in the kitchen as the infusion heats.  Then the foie-gras arrives and the infusion is poured around the dish.  You're all given a small glass of the infusion to enjoy after each bite.  The foie-gras was perfectly seared on top.\u000a\u000aCourse five was artichoke and black truffle soup served with a toasted mushroom brioche with black truffle butter.  The soup is completely water based--no cream or stock.  It's amazing how much flavor comes from the ingredients with just water!\u000a\u000aCourse six was beef tenderloin (with bone marrow on top)--done according to your wishes when you order your meal--with a carrot paleron cannelloni.  The beef was so tender and flavorful. The carrot cannelloni was quite tasty and a very clever concept.\u000a\u000aCourse seven was the cheese course.  There were many options on the cheese cart.  The cheeses were described very thoroughly.  I chose roquefort, a milder cheese from the Savoie region of France, and a more liquid, more full flavored cheese from the Loire Valley.  The plating is done in a way that the cheeses go from mildest to strongest or the other way around depending on where you start.  There's more bread here.  I got two slices, one of a fruit bread and one a nut bread.\u000a\u000aThen came a palate cleanser of chopped blackberry with fresh apple pieces and a small spoon of cinnamon crumb cubes.\u000a\u000aCourse eight was the first dessert--Coconut six ways.  I can't remember all the ways but there was coconut soup, coconut granité, coconut soup, coconut tapioca, fresh coconut slices and one I don't remember.  Delightful!\u000a\u000aCourse nine was the second dessert--chocolate fondant, crunchy praline, and a chicory cream.  Rich chocolate, a tasty cream to dip your fondant in, and the crunchy praline was superb!  A great ending--almost.\u000a\u000aThen the mignardises trolley was wheeled to the table.  There was such a large selection.  I made five choices, a stuffed grape, some jasmine marshmallow, a wonderful petit cheesecake, caramelized banana, and one other I don't remember.  I was on a food high!\u000a\u000aService was extraordinary!  Kriste, the main server, was always attentive and there were two others.  Between the three, there was always an eye on my table to make sure I had anything I needed.  Near the end of the meal, Chef Chartron stopped by my table and introduced himself and asked about how the meal was.  This is always a nice touch.  \u000a\u000aPrior to dinner, Kriste gave me a tour of the restaurant including the Krug Room, one of only five in the world.  After dinner, she took me to the kitchen to speak with Chef Chartron and see the kitchen area.  Chef Chartron was working on a new menu and his chef's table had his papers on which he was writing his plans.  I found out there was a sub-kitchen two floors below and this is the finishing kitchen.  \u000a\u000aIn summary, this was the most enjoyable meal I've had in Las Vegas.  Everything was exceptional--food, service, and surroundings!  This really deserves all five stars!

VWhat says ice skating more than palm trees and sunny, warm skies?  \u000a\u000aI went to the ice rink today and skated for the first time in about 40 years.  What a great time I had!  I went for their Coffee Club skating which is held Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at a cost of $7 which includes skate rental.  \u000a\u000aThe Zamboni had just resurfaced the ice from the morning session, and it was as smooth as can be!  Wow, I never skated on ice this smooth.  Pond ice was all I ever skated on before.\u000a\u000aThere are two rinks in the building, a north and south rink.  The Coffee Club skating is on the South rink.  There were only 10-12 people skating while I was there, so it was quite pleasant.  In addition, school went back into session today, so the open skating during the mid-morning and early afternoon will be adult friendly.

VReview for Restaurant Week 2011 Menu:\u000a\u000aMy first time at Stripsteak and it was excellent!  I usually don't order steak out as it is almost always overcooked for me.  Based on the good reviews on Yelp, Stripsteak became an addition to my Restaurant Week list of places to go.\u000a\u000aAmuse bouche:  Three containers of seasoned fries - garlic herb, truffle, and bay-seasoned.  There were three containers for dipping the fries one mustard and bay seasoned, truffle aioli, and ketchup.  Pace yourself here.  All tables are served the amuse bouche in lieu of a bread basket.  Since I was alone, I could have totally pigged out on these tasty fries.  5/5\u000a\u000aCourse 1:  Duck spring rolls.  Duck confit with sweet and sour cherry drizzle.  The duck was excellent and what a great appetizer.  5/5\u000a\u000aCourse 2:  OK, so I decided to get a steak.  It was the Kansas City strip steak with small sides of creamed corn and mushrooms.  The steak had a grilled small red onion and a yellow tinkerbell pepper.  The pepper is very mild.  The steak was grilled exactly as I ordered - black and blue. 5/5\u000a\u000aCourse 3:  Beignets and vanilla creme brulee.  Perfect ending to the meal.  I forced myself - yeah right - to finish the beignets.  5/5\u000a\u000aAs mentioned in other reviews, when you get ready to leave, you're given a small bag of candy popcorn with the Stripsteak logo to take as a gift.  It will be a TV snack some night.\u000a\u000aMy server, Alexis, was always available and attentive.  When the two eating next to me left for a bathroom trip, she refolded their napkins while they were gone.  I noticed this attention to detail and good service throughout the night.  \u000a\u000aI was quite pleased to see the number of families with young, well behaved children.  There was a concert with someone named Selena Gomez at the Mandalay Events Center and thus the large number of children. Alexis had to explain to me who this Selena was.\u000a\u000aA great evening and another wonderful Restaurant Week experience!

VThis was my first visit to Agave.  I agree with several of the posters who rate this as average food and over-priced.  I do like the building, both inside and out.  We did have good service.  We also were there in the late afternoon when there were few other people there.\u000a\u000aI had the Steak "Alambre" style.  It was a tasty dish that could have used some more heat.  My wife had the Mayan Chicken Tamales.  She liked them but thought they were spicy hot (they weren't) and she thought there was no chicken filing until deep down (there was but it was bland and you couldn't distinguish it from the masa).\u000a\u000aWhen I checked my email later, I received one from Open Table saying that Agave had cancelled my reservation.  I don't know why, but that means no open table points.\u000a\u000aI'm not anxious to return to Agave when there are so many other good Tex/Mex places around this town.

VI ate here last night for the first time with two friends visiting Las Vegas from Great Britain.  The food was very good.  I would have given it four stars, but the prices are too high for the food you get.  These are strip prices, not some off-Strip mall prices.\u000a\u000aI had the southern Indian style diced lamb.  The seasoning was wonderful.  My friends had 1) the Origin India Kebab platter and 2) the lamb shank.  We also had one order of regular and one of garlic naan.  We also ordered fried papardam.  They were out of the fried so we got baked instead.  It was only 4:45 in the afternoon.  \u000a\u000aFor the three of us, the bill was just over $100.  We had cokes and an iced tea, no alcoholic drinks.  Since we had a Restaurant.com certificate, they added 20% service charge to the bill before the discount.  That's just too much for three people for what we got.\u000a\u000aThere are other places that are less pretentious that have good Indian food.  I'll go there in the future.

VI just don't get shabu shabu.  I've been wanting to try it for a long while and today was the day to give it a try as I was in Chinatown to see a matinee show and then was going to the Gold Coast for an evening show.\u000a\u000aThe woman greeted me warmly and she knew I was a neophyte.  She explained the menu to me.  I chose the healthy portion--6 ounces of rib eye and the vegetables that come with it.  She then helped me choose the cooking liquid.  I went with the spicy miso broth and it was very good.  \u000a\u000aShortly after placing my order, the platter of meat was placed in front of me and an assortment of jars of spices, sesame oil, mixed pepper spice and the vegetables were put down and I was left to do my thing.\u000a\u000aI really wasn't sure exactly how to attack the cooking.  Do I put in a fair amount of vegetables and let them simmer and then cook some beef quickly and then remove.  I just winged it and did things the way I guessed it should be.  I had one empty bowl, for liquid I figured, and a small plate for the solid food.\u000a\u000aMy thoughts range along these lines:\u000a\u000aIt's a lot of work for what? \u000aIt tended to be a bit messy for me.\u000aI think a slotted spoon or mesh ladle would have been nice to have to aid removing some of the harder things from the pot.\u000aThere was nothing that stood out about the meal except the spicy miso soup left after cooking the meat and vegetables in the broth.\u000aWhy is it that most Asian restaurants with a sushi bar assume that a person eating alone wants to sit at the bar?  I found the height of the burner and pot on the counter to be harder to get to.\u000a\u000aPrice with one iced tea (I was never asked nor offered a refill) was just under $19.  Add tip and you have an expensive meal for not much food and I did all the work. \u000a\u000aFor $20, I'll go to any other Asian restaurant and I'll be served and not have to screw around with a burner.  I'm glad I tried this once.  I'll be eating elsewhere in the future.

VThis had been on my "To Try" list for months now and I finally went last night.  It was quiet because it was during the Super Bowl.  I got the $55 omakase so I could experience a selection of Japanese food and not order a roll or two and be stuffed.\u000a\u000aMy omakase is just as others have described.  Course 1 - yellowtail with garlic and peppers.  Course 2 - Mizuna salad with tuna, salmon, a wonderful dressing and some capers for added flavor.  Course 3 - Black cod with a soy miso glaze.  The fish was very flaky and delicious.  Course 4 - filet mignon done medium rare.  I would have liked rarer but it was very good.  Course 5 - Assorted nigiri and a bowl of steaming hot clam soup.  The nigiri was quite good and the clam soup was excellent! Course 6 - I had a choice and I took the chocolate soufflé with a scoop of green tea ice cream with a mint sprig.\u000a\u000aI enjoyed the meal and I left not having a stuffed feeling of having eaten too much.  I was going to get the more expensive omakase, but my server steered me away from that because some of the ingredients--lobster and foie gras--were not available.  That was an honesty I like.  \u000a\u000aI would have rated this dinner 3.5 stars, but I rounded it to 4 based on the great servers who were most gracious, attentive, and pleasant.

VI went here last night to try the place out.  It was OK.  I was very close to closing time arriving at around 9:45.  \u000a\u000aThe woman was pleasant and she made my sundae quickly.  I got the Black and Tan Sundae which is described by their menu as:  Creamy vanilla and toasted almond ice cream drowned in Leatherby's caramel and chocolate fudge, topped with whipped cream, nuts and a cherry.\u000a\u000aIt was good but at $7.35 plus tax for two scoops of ice cream, that's too pricey.  For that amount, I can be sitting in Max Brenner's in the Forum Shoppes and not in a run down, older restaurant that has seen better days.\u000a\u000aI don't need to return.

VThis is a nice casino.  Almost all the machines are slant tops and the chairs are very comfortable.\u000a\u000aI have not stayed at the property, but I have seen the room friends were staying in when they were here and it was quite nice.\u000a\u000aWhat more can one say?  Above average casino especially for a locals joint!

VI stopped in today to use my Groupon and got a Red Velvet  Mocha.  There is no coffee flavor in the drink, but it is quite tasty.  The staff was very friendly and brought my drink to the table where I was trying to plan my next move in a game of Words With Friends.\u000a\u000aI took a quick look at the pastries.  WOW!  I'm certain the Nuttelamisu hypnotized me into coming back in the near future to give it a try.  \u000a\u000aI will be back although this is a bit out of my neighborhood.  It is, however, on the way to Las Vegas Little Theatre, so maybe I have a new place to pick up a drink to take to the show!

VI finally stopped in late last week and bought two macarons - one lemon and one vanilla.  They are excellent.  One of them didn't last much longer than arriving at my car.  The other was gone when I had coffee at Starbuck's an hour later.  These could be addictive.  I will have to watch my stops at the Venetian.

VI returned to Bouchon Bakery last week after a disappointing walk by the week before when I saw they had sold out of their wonderful Cheese Danish.  OK, so I'll return, and that's just what I did.\u000a\u000aI got one Cheese Danish and a six pack of macarons.  Wow, they are all so good!  I would give the bakery 5 stars but for the fact that there's absolutely no place to sit and enjoy coffee and a Danish at the bakery.  You have to tote the goodies from the shop to the food court which is alongside the casino as you go from the Bakery to the main corridor for hotel check in.\u000a\u000aI know space is a bit tight there by the Phantom Theatre, but perhaps there's room for a few tables.  Even Starbucks can do tables in very small places.

VI found this Bouchon Bakery a little over a month ago when I searched the Venetian and finally found it by the entrance from the Boulevard near the pedestrian walkway to TI.  It's a small space but they pack a lot of goodness here.  I also found yet another Bouchon Bakery one floor above almost where you enter the hotel when you come over the pedestrian walkway.  Bouchon Bakery plus 2.  This will be more convenient for me when I want something from the bakery when I'am at the Palazzo.  It's not too much to go there from the Palazzo displays.\u000a\u000aToday, I only bought one pain au chocolate.  It was excellent, my wife reported.  Silly me, did I think I was going to get to eat it?  I like to try different things from Bouchon Bakery.  I love their macarons but I can buy just as good at a bakery closer to home and their price is better than Bouchon's.\u000a\u000aThis place is always worth a stop if just to look and, yes, buy!

VI've been here two other times. Today was special as we had our "doughnut crawl" in the large room behind the coffee bar.\u000a\u000aThe two working the slow shop (it's winter break at UNLV) were very polite and helpful.  I got my usual Black Forest Ice Blended and it was great!\u000a\u000aIt was quite good of the staff to let us have our Yelp meeting in their room!

VI met some friends here last night as part of the "Monster Meet" of 2012, an internet-arranged get together of people who know each other from a Las Vegas online discussion board.\u000a\u000aI didn't order anything rather just saying hello to people I had met before and getting to meet some new people.  \u000a\u000aI've never eaten here although I have been at the pub on several occasions for this type of meet.

VI came here with a friend last night before going to the Smith Center.  This is one of her favorite places and I really enjoyed my meal.  \u000a\u000aFirst, she ordered way too much food for 2 people.  We got beef chow fun, mixed vegetables with garlic, breaded salt and pepper pork chops, and a tofu hot pot.  Yikes!  The table was full and there were only two of us.\u000a\u000aThe dishes were all very good.  My favorite was the hot pot.  The tofu is fried first and then put in the broth.  There were a couple of kinds of seafood in the hot pot and some chicken and pork.  There were also some beautiful mushrooms that held the heat from the burner below.  Be on guard to let the mushrooms cool a bit before eating.\u000a\u000aA couple of things regarding service.  We were seated and our server was prompt at getting our order.  Since my friend is from Taiwan, she ordered in Chinese and I'm sure that helped our service.  \u000a\u000aAt the end of the meal, they brought us a complimentary warm mung bean dessert that was very tasty--not too sweet.  Our server also packaged up all the leftovers in take out boxes and I have enough in my refrigerator to feed half the Taiwanese army.  It will taste good as leftovers.\u000a\u000aOne stereotype I encountered was that one of the servers placed a fork and spoon with extra napkins at my plate but not at my friends.  I wanted to jab him with my chopsticks when he next went by, but I realize he was being helpful.

VI've been here several times, but I never reviewed it before.  We went here tonight and had a great meal.  Standard chips and 4 salsas were brought.  The salsas are tomatillo, fire roasted tomato, regular tomato salsa, and a bean dip.  They're all good, but my favorite is the fire roasted.\u000a\u000aWe started with table side made guacamole, and it was very good.  I got it not spicy because my wife is the ultimate gringa.  I put all the peppers on my side of the bowl after our server had finished.  How gringa is she you ask?  If you wave a pepper over the plate, she'll say it's too spicy.  Enough said.\u000a\u000aFor the main course, I got the carne asada platter, slices of skirt steak with pasilla chiles and cotija cheese.  With it comes a cheese enchilada, some pico, and sides of veggies and black beans (my choice but there are other beans or Mexican potatoes available.  My wife had the pollo ranchero.  It's the most gringa thing on the menu.  She also had the sides but thought they were spicy (they weren't).  Each entree comes with a salad with your choice of dressing.  I've always thought this was odd for a Mexican restaurant.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, we shared a chocolate pecan ball which is a vanilla bean ice cream ball dipped in chopped pecans and has chocolate drizzled over it!  It was excellent.\u000a\u000aI have a snack for TV time tonight.  I can finish my chips and guacamole while watching Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.

VI stopped for breakfast this morning on the way to the Run For the Wish 5K.  I had to buzz to get in because it was only 7:30 or so when I got here.  The front door was unlocked, and in I went to a very dark place.\u000a\u000aI was given a menu and time to look it over.  When I asked about one of the breakfasts, he said to me that all of their dishes are large portions.  I ordered the Miner's Breakfast, a combination of many sliced potatoes along with scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, onions, and peppers all topped with melted cheddar and pepper jack cheese.  It was very tasty, and it was too much.  Things here seem to be made for two people. \u000a\u000aI was served coffe in the beginning, but I never was asked about a refill.  Service was a bit slow, but since there were only three of us there, it should have been better.  I took away one star for the service and the no refill on the coffee.\u000a\u000aI did enjoy breakfast and I'll continue my tradition of having breakfast at a different place before each of the events like this that I do.

VI've eaten here several times and the food is generally good.  Last night, I had the Grilled Chicken Salad with Blue Cheese dressing.  The salad was fresh, tasty, and a good sized portion.  Drink service was handled quickly.  \u000a\u000aThere have been times when slow service has been an issue.  Last night was OK.  With the restaurant about 1/2 full, one of the other servers was watching other tables.  He came over and asked what I was drinking and brought me another iced tea.  Later, he brought some rolls.  Although he was not our server, it was great of him to keep an eye out for us.\u000a\u000aPrices are moderate.  I enjoy Marilyn's.

VI have not been a fan of Fry's in the past because I never found anyone who knew something about anything.  Questions were simply unanswered if you managed to flag down a floor person.\u000a\u000aI stopped in yesterday to waste some time and to look for another iPhone charger for the car.  Since my last visit a few years ago, it seems like they have done some training.  There were several sales staff around and I was even asked by one if they could help me.\u000a\u000aI bought my charger and some CD paper covers I needed to get.  A few extra points always for their checkout.  The wait is generally short with many positions open at once and a staff member to send you to the open positions.

VI saw Crazy Horse Paris several years ago and really enjoyed the show.  It was sexy, classy, and very entertaining.\u000a\u000aNow that it's closing at MGM in the next week, I needed to go see it again before it's gone.  There was only a minor difference in the two shows I saw.  The one number I really didn't care for was the jailhouse dance.  It seemed interminable and was not that good.  The magician was OK as an interlude, but the three guys who did the "short leg" dancing were a hoot!\u000a\u000aI really like Upside Down and Chair Me Up.  These are cleverly choreographed and artfully done.\u000a\u000aI am sorry this show is closing but I'm glad I had the chance to enjoy it twice.

V5 of us went for breakfast this morning (26 June 2010).  Everything was excellent.  Two had an omelet and two had the white chocolate and orange bread French toast, and one had the smoked salmon with bagel.  .  We also had one milk and cookies soufflé for dessert that three of us shared.  Everything was excellent!\u000a\u000aThe room was quite delightful and the service.  Our waiter had no personality whatsoever.  I would have given the fifth star but for his attitude of detachment.\u000a\u000aGreat breakfast spot.

VI've eaten here a lot of times because it's almost in my back yard.  Visiting twice in the last week reminded me that it was time for a review.\u000a\u000aThursday evening, we met friends for the dinner buffet.  The prime rib was outstanding - red, the way I love it.  They were also grilling slices for people who want their meat dead.  The shrimp were good, but I did skip having any sushi.  Instead, I loaded up on some kimchee and then on to the gelato area for my dessert fix.\u000a\u000aToday, we went for breakfast.  It's always a nice way to start the day.  A bit of chopped chicken liver, some smoked salmon, and a small sampling of oatmeal with raisins, brown sugar, and cinnamon.  \u000a\u000aI'll be back often.  I like the food and the ambiance.  My only complaint is, "Where the hell are the spoons?"  You'd think they'd at least have spoons automatically in the morning table settings when so many people are having coffee.  This is not just a Red Rock gripe, either.  I see this more often around town.  Why?

VI've eaten at the Bistro Buffet twice, the latest being this afternoon for lunch.  Since it was 1/2 price Senior Thursday, the line was huge.  Luckily, the friends I was meeting at the Palms had the good sense to get in line without waiting for me, so our wait was long, but not as bad as it could have been.  And for $6.49 for lunch, how can you beat the price?\u000a\u000aI had some Thai red curry chicken, a piece of thin steak they called NY sirloin, some Hawaiian style pork, shrimp pad Thai, among other things.  The curry chicken was about the best thing I had.  It had a good curry zip but not enough to intimidate those who don't like spicy food.  I would have liked to have had spicier, but then it wouldn't appeal to the masses.\u000a\u000aSince we were at the end of the lunch time frame, desserts were flying of the shelves en masse.  What was left was good.  Mostly mini cupcakes and mini cake squares.\u000a\u000aThe seating is limited for the numbers of people they draw and this makes it less likely that I'll be here often.  There are other buffets in town with better food and seating arrangements.  The price is the most positive thing about the Bistro Buffet.

VWe ate here again tonight and again really enjoyed the meal.  We are creatures of habit when it comes to the Cantina.  My wife generally gets the Pollo con pipian (chicken breast with pumpkin seeds in sauce) while I get the Pollo boracho - chicken breast with a sauce laced with nopales (cactus strips).\u000a\u000aThe chips and salsa are usually brought very quickly, and the waitstaff has always been quite professional.  The bus staff here is above and beyond - the reason for the 4th star.  I never have to ask for an iced tea refill.  They are around before I need to.\u000a\u000aWe will continue coming here and enjoying these two dishes.

VThe fall theatre season has started at UNLV so I stopped here for dinner last night and had a great meal.  I did their Thursday Special of the Day, Barbicoa.  For $12.95, you get soup of the day - in this case it was an excellent cream of mushroom, the barbacoa, cubes of pot roast that are cooked in Mexican spices, rice, and whole beans.\u000a\u000aWhen I asked about the spiciness of the barbacoa, the waiter said it was a red sauce with a little spice.  When informed that I liked spicy food, he said he'd tell them to make it spicier.  He did, it was, and boy did I like it.  Extra red cili seasonings gave a zip to the dish.  The beans were also well spiced and had some wonderful cotija cheese for garnish.  The rice was standard Mexican restaurant rice--nothing terribly good nor bad about it.  You also have your choice of flour or corn tortillas.\u000a\u000aService was excellent as usual.  This is a great place to eat, but it's a bonus when you an have a quiet, enjoyable, and reasonably priced meal before heading east on Flamingo to get to UNLV.

VI have eaten here a lot of times but never reviewed it.  This buffet is quite good.  They have some of the best no sugar added desserts.  Now to the more mundane things.\u000a\u000aI had some pork carnitas, a pork and bean chimichanga, a piece of fried catfish and some hush puppies.  I don't know what it is about those "pups." There's nothing special to them, but I'm hooked.  For the 2nd trip, I just had a tamale and some onion rings.  I generally skip the beef here because they rarely have prime rib.  Rather it's more of a baron of beef or a steamship round.\u000a\u000aService was top notch.  And of course, there are those desserts!  At $13.99 for two people (we had a two for one coupon) and paying the $13.99 with points, it was a good Sunday dinner.

VMet some friends here for dinner tonight and most things were done OK for a buffet.  However, two things caught my eye.  1)  Perogies larger than 2 raviolis combined and sitting in tomato sauce; and 2) Stuffed cabbage with a sweet raisin sauce.  Who on Earth ever added these tender morsels to the lineup? Certainly not a Top Chef contestant.  I didn't try either of these, but one member of our party tried the stuffed cabbage, but didn't know what it was.  He remarked as to how sweet it was.\u000a\u000aI did try some of the red cabbage and that had been sugared too!  It doesn't need to be that way.  The rest of the things I tried were good especially, to my surprise, the Osso Buco.

VMichael U. and I met here for dinner before a show and the meal was excellent!  Our server, Kelly, asked us a few questions and got our drink order before leaving us to check the menu and make our choices.  \u000a\u000aWhen we ordered, we said we were sharing everything and asked for plates for the splitting.  No problem at all.\u000a\u000aWe started with an amuse-bouche of chick peas on lightly toasted bread.  A very nice starter to get the meal off to a tasty start.\u000a\u000aFirst up were two starters--warm tripe "alla"Romana and country style paté.  Both were excellent.  The tripe was cut in small strips that were very tender and the tomato sauce was mild and complimented the tripe perfectly. There was freshly grated cheese on top.   The paté, made with pork, was served with blackberry conserve, greens, and cotica.  The paté was very good.  Two nice starters to begin the meal.\u000a\u000aFor the pasta course, we got the pork trotter ravioli and the beef cheek ravioli.  They allowed us to order off the tasting menu for the beef cheek ravioli.  For the pork trotter, there was freshly grated cheese.  The beef cheek ravioli was in a sauce of black truffles and crushed duck liver.  Both dishes were superb!  The beef cheek had a hearty flavor of truffle and liver.  The pork trotter had pieces of chive and their blossoms.  The textures in the pork trotter ravioli were great.  Two winners for the pasta course.\u000a\u000aFor main courses, we got rabbit porchetta and roasted lamb shoulder.  The rabbit was accompanied by a carrot sformato, sunflower sprouts and crispy confit.  The flavors were excellent and the rabbit was very tasty.  The lamb shoulder was cooked medium rare and served with cannellini beans and some greens.  Both main courses wer outstanding!  Very flavorful, simple yet elegant dishes.  \u000a\u000aFor dessert, M ordered the chocolate budino and I ordered a special--peaches and cream.  M's budino was made more like a soufflé and the chocolate could have been richer.  The top was pierced and some melted chocolate poured on the top.  The peaches and cream were fantastic!  The dish consisted of lightly grilled peach slices on a bed of mascarpone and a peach sorbet.  A very simple dish executed so nicely.\u000a\u000aAfter dinner, we were brought a box with 7 mignardises.  A tasty selection of little bites to end our meal.  \u000a\u000aService was outstanding during our meal.  Plates were cleared quickly, new silverware and dishes were brought for each course, and the explanations of the dishes was great!\u000a\u000aAfter walking by B&B so many times and looking at the menu, it was really good to try the place.  Eating with a friend also gave me the chance to taste double the amount of items without eating double the amount of food.

VI'm sorry I'm getting around to this review just as the habitat is about to close.  I spent much time watching the lions play with their trainers or gnaw of the large play balls they have in the habitat.\u000a\u000aAlthough they are in captivity behind plexiglas, I always find looking at big cats to be relaxing and great fun!\u000a\u000aI will miss this habitat when MGM folds it and replaces it.  It's just one more free thing that will be gone from the Strip.

VReview for casino and ticketing only:\u000a\u000aI've been to Caesars many times for shows and I've always found it to be an interesting place to people watch.  I like the different ways to get to the Palace and Forum casinos and how people I'm with often seem to get lost without proper directing.\u000a\u000aI was here today to buy a ticket for the new show "Absinthe."  OK, off to the box office by the Colosseum.  Nope.  Try check in.  No  box office.  Ask the concierge.  Oh it's outside by Serendipity 3.  Who knew?  Well they did.  And then, the box office doesn't open until noon, so I sat in the shade and played Angry Birds.\u000a\u000aThe box office attendant was great!  She was very competent and helpful.  Now for the show in another week.  I can't wait!

VOK, our highs are only in the 80s so what am I supposed to eat?  Go to Mr. Tofu and have a bowl of some boiling hot sundubu.  I went here tonight on the recommendation of several Yelp friends.  I was not disappointed.\u000a\u000aThere were only 2 tables occupied and service was quick.  I ordered the beef sundubu spicy hot.  I found their hot to not be as hot as I expected.  Next time, I'll ask for some extra spiciness.\u000a\u000aBefore the soup came, he brought me 5 banchan dishes.  I especially enjoyed the kimchi and the pickled radish.\u000a\u000aWhen the soup came, he warned me that it was very hot (bowl and contents) and to take care.  The soup was excellent.  Good slices of beef, wonderfully soft tofu, and a hearty broth that was full of flavor.\u000a\u000aI can't give it 5 stars because this is the first sundubu I've had so I have nothing to compare it to.  Suffice it to say, I'll be back.  This is real comfort food Korean style!

VI like the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Arts, enough that I renewed my annual membership today.  I don't go as often as I should but I can and will--well not if history is my guide.\u000a\u000aI know the space is small and I realize they charge too much for admission given that fact.  The audio tour wand included with the admission is almost worth the admission price.\u000a\u000aThe current exhibit--A Sense of Place:Landscapes from Monet to Hockney is small with a limited number of paintings and other art.  The quality, however, is excellent.  Many of the pieces are on loan from The Boston Museum of Fine Arts.  Some are from the Contemporary Museum in San Diego, and a few pieces are from the MGM Resorts collection.\u000a\u000aI didn't have all that much time today, so I did the audio tour and moved quickly through the exhibition.  Since I have the membership for a year, I can go back another time and spend more time studying the individual works and learning more about the artists.\u000a\u000aAgain, I know the place is small, but at least we have a fine arts gallery.  With the Guggenheim closing and the West Sahara Library Museum closed, we need something like the BGFA.  It is worth having.

VThree of us had dinner here tonight to try something new and use a Groupon.  The dinners were OK--nothing exceptional nor outstanding.  For an appetizer, two of us shared the 1/2 pound of shrimp on a sizzling granite stone.  The shrimp were tiny things, but tasty.  The dipping sauce was quite good, but the shrimp could have used some more spicing.  One had a Caesar salad that was very good, perhaps the best dish of the evening.\u000a\u000aFor main courses, we had Ventano Spiedini (chicken cutlets stuffed with cheese), Risotto Alla Milanese with blackened shrimp(4), and Chicken Saltimbocca.  We all thought the dishes were OK.  The sauce of my saltimbocca was very good.  The person who had the risotto was disappointed with the dish. The chef does not use any salt.  My wife, who rarely salts anything, used more than I've ever seen.\u000a\u000aWe skipped dessert.  Service was very good.  Our server was top notch.  The bus person could have refilled the iced tea faster, but that was minor.\u000a\u000aThe view would be excellent on a cooler evening, enjoying the lighted Strip from the patio.  I don't think I'd return.

VI went to see Jeff Tracta at The Pearl last Sunday.  I've been here for several concerts but I never reviewed the place before.\u000a\u000aI give it 3 stars because of the layout.  If you're on the floor, you need to walk down several sets of stairs.  Floor seats are generally the most accessible but not at the Pearl.\u000a\u000aThere are also several little offset places where there's only one way in and out which makes for a backup of people trying to leave at the end of a concert.\u000a\u000aThe sound is good, but the folding chairs are close to each other--in fact attached to each other by plastic slip ties which are de rigueur for some venues in this town.  So, while The Pearl has some good entertainment, it's simply OK.

VI went to BJ's yesterday for lunch with a group of 11 people.  There were four parties, including ours, with 10 or more people yesterday and the staff handled it well.  The kitchen was a bit overwhelmed so our orders took longer than normal, but it was fine because we weren't in a hurry.\u000a\u000aI ordered the soup and 1/2 sandwich.  For soup I ordered the tortilla soup.  The sandwich was the turkey Cobb.  The soup was outstanding.  The tortilla strips are in the bowl and the warm soup was poured overtop so they retained their crispness.  There was also some pieces of avocado and the flavor of cilantro was very present for a wonderful flavor.  I was a bit disappointed in the sandwich.  It was billed as roasted turkey.  Well, it was, but it was luncheon meat roasted turkey and sliced thin for the sandwich.  It also says with blue cheese dressing.  It was there but the blue cheese flavor was not.\u000a\u000aAs for our server, she was really good.  My iced tea was replaced with a fresh glass when I got low.  She did commit a cardinal sin with one of my friends.  He ordered another beer and when she brought it, she picked up his unfinished first glass and removed it before he could stab her with his fork.  That's a big no no!!  She didn't do that with the little iced tea that was left in my glass when she brought the fresh glass.  Wow, were we surprised.\u000a\u000aSumming up BJ's, it's OK.  It's not a place to which I'd go often.  There are just too many good places to go in this town and this area.

VAfter a hard morning of climbing ridges in Arizona, I stopped here just before coming home.  I decided to try their new peach blueberry latte, iced.  Wow!  What a great flavor!\u000a\u000aI'll be back for more as the warmer weather heats things up.  This will be a great warm weather refresher!

VI had a private dining room for breakfast.  OK, it wasn't private, there was just no one else there.  This was a really different place to come.  Evidently, I got there after the breakfast crowd had gone and before the lunch people came.  It was quite OK.\u000a\u000aA gentleman greeted me at the door and said to sit wherever I wanted.  He brought a menu and said the server would be right there.  After a few minutes, she hadn't come out of the kitchen yet.  He asked me what I'd like to have and I asked him what the frittata of the day was.  He said, "I can make you anything you want."  He then gave me several options and I chose the frittata with sun dried tomatoes and feta cheese.\u000a\u000aHe had brought me coffee already and the server appeared from what she was doing while he went to the kitchen to work his magic.  The frittata was soon delivered along with the rye toast I requested.  The toast had some house made "jam" that they made from fresh fruits.  The fruits were cooked down until there was some thickness and then sweetened the server explained to me.  It was more of a dipping sauce than a spread but it was very good!\u000a\u000aI finished this fine breakfast.  Service was really very good.  I know I caught them at a bad time as they must have been preparing for their lunch crowd.  This was an excellent breakfast and I'm glad I finally got to try this place.

VReview is for the casino only:\u000a\u000aI've only been to the South Point four or five times.  It's a nice, wide open space, with good spacing for walking the aisles of the casino.  The staff has been very nice.  I spoke on the phone to a woman at the slot club after the hotel went from Boyd to Gaughn, and she was an absolute delight explaining what I needed to do to redeem a freebie left over from the Boyd days.\u000a\u000aIt seems like the place is so far from where I live, but with its fine location, I can be there in about 20 minutes from home, so ti's really not that bad.\u000a\u000aAfter my experience with the show and some gaming last night, I'll be returning more often!

VI stopped in here today to get an item that another chain did not have in stock.  Parking was easy and close to the door--surprisingly.  I didn't know the layout so I had to look until I found the right aisle.\u000a\u000aCheckout was quick and the cashier did not push in his question about getting a Target card.\u000a\u000aThis is not the Target I'd go to, but it was on my way home from United Blood Services so it made a handy stop.

VI stopped here with a  neighbor yesterday around noon and I forgot the two rules of IHOP.  Rule #1:  Never get anything other than breakfast.  Rule #2:  Don't forget Rule #1.\u000a\u000aI almost ordered some pancakes but at the last minute I changed my mind and ordered their new turkey and bacon club sandwich.  It's not really a club and had I read the menu I would have seen that it was on a grilled roll.  Misnamed product I'd say.  The disappointing thing about the sandwich was that the turkey was sliced lunch meat, not sliced turkey.  It was an ungainly sandwich and the innards squeezed out as I ate it.  The redeeming part of lunch was the seasoned fries--seasoned mostly with salt, but then I'm a salt freak, so I thought they were great.\u000a\u000aService was OK.  After we got our lunchers, we realized the server forgot to give us napkins or silverware.  Unable to flag anyone down, we walked to another table and took theirs.\u000a\u000aI haven't been to an IHOP in a couple of years, but if I return, I'll remember Rule #1 --- or #2.

VMandalay Place is an OK shopping and dining venue between Mandalay Bay Hotel and the Luxor.  I sometimes come here to walk the short distance between the two properties and people watch.  It's great fun.\u000a\u000aThere are some good restaurants here--RM Seafood and Ri Ra to name the two I've been to.  There are some good shops if you need or want the kinds of things they sell.\u000a\u000aThe one turn off for me is the completely overwhelming smell that emanates from the soap shop.  I need to steer clear of that place to avoid sneezing.

VIs it me or is Denny's now mostly for gray hairs like me?  The food is aimed at the older market and even the music is appealing to me.  \u000a\u000aI rate this 2  1/2 stars.  \u000a\u000aWe stopped here for a quick meal after visiting a friend in the hospital and I had to be home, change, and to downtown Las Vegas for a play at the Las Vegas Academy.  Denny's fit the bill.  I had a chicken breast with two sides.  Small meal and it was quite tasty.\u000a\u000aThe staffing was awful.  One waitress for all the tables.  That's not acceptable and one reason why the star count isn't a full 3.

VReview of the Minute Clinic in this CVS:\u000a\u000aI came to this Minute Clinic because staff at two other CVS stores said this was where I need to go for a shingles vaccination.  They were wrong.  The thing that salvaged my stop here was the great customer service of the woman at the clinic.  She called two other places and got addresses and cost for me.  She was very helpful.\u000a\u000aSince this isn't in my neighborhood, I can't speak for the store.

VI've been to the District a few times and I came here last night for dinner.  I had a bit of difficulty finding the restaurant.  Note: do not depend on the Google maps with the Yelp iPhone's "Get Directions."  It literally took me the wrong way.  I made my way to one of the signs with a map for the District and located my restaurant that way.  I had walked very close to it but Google took me away from where I needed to go.  It's not good for off street areas like the District.\u000a\u000aNow, for the dogs.  I know it's a dog friendly place, but can't you leave the damn dogs at home for awhile or will they tear up your place or cry incessantly because they miss you?  I sure hate to see what you'll be like when you have kids!!!  It's really disconcerting to walk around a pile of dog crap while the owner goes off in search of a dog bag holder that isn't empty.  Leave the critters home and let us who don't own a dog or do not wish to have them crapping where other people walk have a nice place to walk.

VI stopped here to fill up before taking friends hiking at Mount Charleston.  It's not the cheapest, but it was an easy off and back on Flamingo on the way to Las Vegas Boulevard.  It was early in the morning--about 6:30--and there was only one car there.  \u000a\u000aI got my gas and was on my way in no time.  That's what I wanted and this 7 Eleven filled the bill.

VI went in here yesterday to look for a replacement GPS unit for the one I lost.  A clerk soon asked me if I needed help (it was that where am I look that tipped him off).  He told me they didn't sell that kind of hiking GPS unit, just ones for golf, and he told me two places he'd recommend I go.\u000a\u000aThe fates conspired to help me find the LOST GPS unit.  It was hiding in plain sight here at home so them not having GPS units like I wanted saved me some money.  If the find had anything to do with them, I'd raise this to a 5 star review.\u000a\u000aAs it is, the store is convenient for me and they had a very nice supply of sporting goods and clothes.  I will be back.

VI went to the ATM this morning.  The place was quiet--Sundays are always good for that.\u000a\u000aI don't go to this branch very often unless it's right where I'm going.  There are other Wells Fargo branches that have better parking and ingress and egress.\u000a\u000aSince I was on my bike at the drive through, it was an easy in and out today.

VI like the Fremont Street Experience.  It's kind of corny, but it's a great place to people watch as you keep your fingers on your wallet.  I was there for Elvis Week when they had the competition to see who was the best Elvis impersonator.  Nothing screams Las Vegas like a Cadillac convertible leading 20+ Elvi down Fremont Street to the area where a special stage had been set up.  It was a hoot.\u000a\u000aSaturday nights are fun, too, because there are a number of men and women who dress up so you can get your photo taken with them for a tip.  Examples:  the band KISS, an Elvira-like, boot wearing lovely dresses in black with wonderful high heel black boots and a set of black wings.  Add this in with the guys holding the signs that 9/11 was an inside job and you have the First Amendment at its finest.\u000a\u000aThe light show itself doesn't grab me like it used to.  Maybe I've just seen it too many times.  Still, I enjoy watching tourists watching the show and gauging their reaction.\u000a\u000aFremont Street is another great, free thing that Las Vegas has to offer.

VThis was my second visit to the Las Vegas Farmer's market at the Bruce Trent Park.  There were several vendors missing since my last visit - most notably - Bon Breads.  I guess with the heat of the summer, some of the vendors are staying away from this late afternoon/evening market and going to the new market at Tivoli Village.\u000a\u000aI'd give the Market 4 stars if it weren't for the drop in vendors. The vendors there today had some nice things, but I was looking for bread.

VI go to the Summerlin Library for performances in the theatre.  It holds about 300 people and is a perfect size for the community productions staged there.  The first play I saw when I moved to Las Vegas was at the library theatre.\u000a\u000aAcoustics are good and there is even a small bit for the band when a musical has live music.\u000a\u000aI went tonight to see Signature Productions "Sound of Music."  As usual, they did a fine job and took advantage of all the things that make this theatre a great house.

VI have to keep the 5 stars rating in tact because this theatre company deserves no less.  They always put on first class musicals, staged well, cast well, and full of very talented people.\u000a\u000aWith Singin' in the Rain, Little Shop of Horrors, and the Sound of Music, this season has been a smash!  Have you seen it rain indoors during Singin' in the Rain?  If you missed it, you missed some wonderful stag craft.  They have in past years done Beauty and the Beast, the King and I, and All Shook Up to name a few.\u000a\u000aThe ticket prices are always a bargain for the quality of the show.  Go to one of their shows and judge for yourself.  I'm sure you'll love this theatre company.

VI met two friends here yesterday for lunch.  We wanted to try several things but some of the normal crew couldn't make it.\u000a\u000aAfter a bit of confusion on our part about what to order and the idea of mixing sauces on one pizza-spearate for each half, we got our order in and then had a seat.  This is a no frills, small spot.  My one photo basically shows all the seating except for some not seen on the right.  You get your own plastic ware and napkins from a table to the left of the deli case and there are salt and pepper shakers there and some hot peppers and other spices you might want with Italian food.\u000a\u000aWe first got fried gnocchi which were OK.  The marinara dipping sauce was good.  Two of us shared a fried rice ball with some tomato sauce and lots of cheese.  It was good.  Next, we had two pizzas.  Yes, three people eating two pizzas.  We got a thin style white pizza and a Sicilian style Margherita pizza.  Needless to say, one of left Cugino's with some leftovers--me.  Andrea enjoyed the pizza tonight.\u000a\u000aThe pizzas were both good.  I'm spoiled by a white truffle pizza I'm used to getting so this white pizza was a little lacking.  The Margherita was good with a rich sauce and lots of melted cheese.  We also had an order of garlic knots with their good marinara dipping sauce.  For me, this was the star of lunch.  They had good garlic flavor that wasn't lost when dipped in the marinara.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, we each had a cannoli.  Thank you M.\u000a\u000aThis is a great lunch place for students because it's right across the street from UNLV's student center.  \u000a\u000aI think I'll stop in and try some of their deli salads.  That would be my reason for returning.  The rest was good but pretty standard Italian fare.

VHeading home, I made a quick stop here to pick up a McFlurry for dessert.  Service was prompt, the restaurant was clean, and about the only thing to diminish my enjoyment of the McFlurry was the woman talking on her cell phone at about 120 decibels.  After a few strategic glares from me, she took it outside.\u000a\u000aI generally don't stop at thisMcDonald's, but given the circumstances and the fact I was heading home, it made a good place to get dessert!\u000a\u000aAnd, there's free wifi.

VI was at the Starbucks in the Trails Village Center and needed to stop at the ATM at Wells Fargo.  There wasn't a single car in any of the three lanes even the one with the ATM.  That's almost 4 stars without thinking.\u000a\u000aThis is an OK place, but it's not in my neighborhood and it's a bit of a pain getting in and out with the traffic coming in and out of the Trails Center.\u000a\u000aI have lived here over a decade and this is my first check in here says something.

VI've had a Groupon for months and I let it expire.  This was my first time using an expired Groupon for its original cost rather than what it would be worth and thinks went smoothly.\u000a\u000aI had plans this morning that fell through because of the strong winds.  What to do?  Stop somewhere for breakfast.  Since I had the Groupon, why not get the value out of the original purchase.\u000a\u000aI've driven by the Maple Tree a number of times so it was a piece of cake to get to.  There were only two other tables occupied as it was getting close to 10:30.  The server told be I could sit anywhere I wanted and I chose a table near the kitchen doors with a view of the front of the place.\u000a\u000aOn the way in, I noticed there was a special today--red velvet waffle.  I ordered that along with sausage links.  When the waffle was brought from the kitchen, it looked like a regular waffle.  The young woman said something along the lines of, "It looks brown but there's a bit of red there.  It's red velvet."  We both chuckled.\u000a\u000aThe waffle was served with their maple flavored cream cheese and toasted pecans.  There was also a small container of maple syrup which really wasn't needed.  While the waffle didn't look like red velvet, it did taste like it and it was quite good.  The sausage links were very hot and good and my coffee was refilled anytime I needed.  Service was very good and the two young women were very pleasant.\u000a\u000aThis is off the beaten path for me.  Normally I'm on my way home in the evening when I'm coming through this section of Chinatown and since they're open for breakfast and lunch, this will be only an occasional stop.

V*** Review is for Spring 2013 Restaurant Week menu ***\u000a\u000a\u000aFirst the food:\u000a\u000aThe bread basket was brought a fair amount of time after I ordered.  I was told there was honey wheat, ciabatta, white, something else, and their homemade corn bread. As you can see from the photo, the basket was mostly corn bread which was good, but another piece of bread was just plain.\u000a\u000aFor the first course,  I ordered the potato leek soup with lobster, sour cream dumplings, and jalapeño bacon crumbles.  The dish was presented as a bowl with the lobster, dumplings, and bacon in the bowl and then the soup was poured from a server onto the ingredients listed.  I was asked if I wanted some freshly ground pepper.  When I said yes, the server began a hunt to find a pepper grinder.  Evidently they had been put away from the day before and hadn't been brought back out.  The soup wasn't very hot.  The dumplings were the best part of the soup.  I also liked the bacon.  As you chewed it, the jalapeño flavor was released and left a little heat in your mouth for the next spoon of soup.\u000a\u000aThere was no choice for the main course.  It was Australian Waygu strip steak with a bone marrow flan and some wine reduction.  I ordered my steak black and blue.  It came out medium rare.  The steak looked a bit like a rectangular hockey puck and it cut about the same.  Inside, it was tender, but the outside was damn tough.  The flavor of the steak was nothing that I'd remember past the immediate bite I was consuming.  It was bland, also.\u000a\u000aCourse 3 consisted of two sides--asparagus and truffled pave potatoes.  The potatoes were absolutely the blandest thing I could eat.  I ate the truffle pieces that were on the top and enjoyed that the most.  Pave potatoes is their slang for fancy, stacked, thinly cut potato slices with no flavor.  The asparagus was OK.  It was crisp and better than being cooked until it's soft and mushy.  \u000a\u000aFor dessert, you had a choice of cheesecake or cheesecake.  The menu was different from their Restaurant Week menu online.  The mascarpone cheesecake on carrot coulis had some sorbet and pineapple pieces.  It was good.  It was not the chocolate peanut butter bar I was hoping to order.\u000a\u000aThe service:\u000a\u000aI was stunned by the lackadaisical manner of the staff that served me last night.  I saw my waiter twice, when I ordered and when he brought the bill.  I saw the person who delivered bread and non alcohol drinks 3 times, once with the bread and twice for iced tea.  I saw a bus person three times when he came to remove dishes.  \u000a\u000aThe score for my pink wrapper test was 50/50.  One test was a fail and one was a pass.  No one came by to ask how the meal was.  I waited a long time before the liquid person came to ask if I wanted some more iced tea.  In short, people just didn't seem to care.  I had more conversation and rapport with the young woman seated at the table next to me than I did the staff.\u000a\u000aWhen my server brought the bill, I asked him to do me a favor.  I asked him to tell the chef that medium rare was not black and blue.  He hesitated for a few seconds as if things didn't connect and then said, "Oh, it was cooked too much?"  He left the table and never said another word.  It was then that I started to fill out the comment card, something I rarely do.  When the server came back with my credit card slips, he curiously removed the salt and pepper shakers from the table.  Did it look like I was going to slip them into my pocket?\u000a\u000aAs for the ambience of the place, it was nouveau dark as this photo shows:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/charlie-palmer-steak-las-vegas-3#ZR8UVgbVry2CagHkQEp4lA\u000a\u000aFor some reason, after I was there for about 15 minutes, the lights came up half bright for about two minutes and then went back down to this level.  Cozy, romantic, and very dark are all appropriate words.  What really got me the most was looking toward the other room and seeing the reflection of a basketball game.  It was coming from the bar/lounge.  Can't we do without TV in a restaurant like this.  This just bugs me to no end.  If I wanted to eat in a sports bar, I would have.\u000a\u000aI really was disappointed by this whole evening.  With so many great steakhouses on the Strip, I won't be returning to Charlie Palmers.

VI came to get some diet Arizona iced tea.  It's the only store that sells it.  It's not the normal 99 Cents Only Store I go to, but it was close to where I was so I stopped.\u000a\u000aCheck out was quite fast.  For some visits, it takes awhile, but they were on top of things!

VI've only been here twice in the years I've lived here, and last night I was walking through on my way to El Segundo Sol.  \u000a\u000aThere are a couple of place of note for me--the Apple Store which is fun just to go in and look.  The free wifi is always nice if you need it.  My other spot of note is the Starbucks in about the center.  There's a large sitting area there where you can have your coffee and people watch.\u000a\u000aAfter dinner, I walked through the mall from east to west and back.  I was amazed at the number of places that have absolutely nothing of interest for a person of my age.  It really is a young peoples' mall for the most part.\u000a\u000aStill, it's a a fun place to pass a little time that I needed to kill until it was time to leave for a show - not a fashion show.

VI went here for tickets today to the Sampras, Agassi, Courier and Chang tennis match this fall.  I used to go here a lot when Las Vegas had an arena football team, but since that left, I've only been here once since.\u000a\u000aOne of the things I like the most is walking around the Mack and looking at the memorabilia in the cases from different concerts and boxing matches that were held at the Mack.\u000a\u000aThe building shows its age in some respects, but it still is a grand place to see an event.  I've been here for National Finals Rodeo also.  I find it easy in and out.  After getting my ticket today, I was through the tunnel and on my way home in no time at all.\u000a\u000aWhere else can you walk out the front door and see the planes landing at McCarran and look a bit more to the right and see lovely, Lady Las Vegas.  I sort of strut when I'm here knowing this is my town!

VThis is a review for the West Las Vegas Library Theatre.  The theatre is similar to those at several libraries in Clark County.  It is a proscenium stage with seating for approximately 200.\u000a\u000aI have been to the theatre several times because this is the home for the Las Vegas Contemporary Dance Theatre which generally has two shows per year--a spring and fall show.\u000a\u000aThe lobby for the theatre is somewhat small, but it's sufficient for the size of the theatre.

VThis is a tough review to write.  On the one hand, it's necessary to see Dr. Mukhopadhyay as needed for digestive ailments or in my case, colon screening because I'm of the age when that's a diagnostic test which can detect cancer of the colon early.  On the other hand, having the procedure done isn't a lot of fun.  Well, at least the getting ready part the night before isn't much fun.\u000a\u000aAs for the test itself, once the cleanse is finished and you're at the Summerlin Hospital Endoscopy Center, the nap is quite refreshing and you remember nothing!\u000a\u000aMy follow up visit with the doctor--note how I avoid typing his name twice--was good news and I don't have to see him for another 5 years!  \u000a\u000aI would recommend Dr. Mukhopadhyay to anyone who needs to see a digestive specialist.  He's a very personable man.

VWe stopped here last night in between to places we needed to be.  I knew from reading the reviews on Yelp that it was a small place and it is!  There are 5 tables that hold a total of 14 people.  I guess that's why it's named well and they had a number of take out visits while we were there.\u000a\u000aI checked the daily specials board and saw pumpkin curry.  I ordered it with chicken, spice level 7 on a 1 to 10 scale.  My wife got her standard pepper and garlic chicken which does not have a spice level.  We also got an order of vegetarian egg rolls.  \u000a\u000aEverything was very good.  The egg rolls were very good and were delivered very hot to our table.  The pumpkin curry was something very different for me and I'd certainly get it again.  I tasted my wife's chicken and it, too, was good and she liked it.  Unlike what she's used to at other Thai restaurants, Thai For To Go deep fries the chicken briefly--no coating--just enough to give a bit of crispness and cooking to the chicken.  \u000a\u000aA couple of small things.  Being so small, the tables are small.  We would have been better off sitting at one of the two tables for four people because there almost wasn't enough room for the dishes on the table.  Also, we had our egg rolls for about 2 minutes when she came out with our main dishes.  Perhaps I need to ask people to wait, but I really like some time to enjoy the appetizer before having to start the main course.  Again, due to its size, there's no customer bathroom available without going through the kitchen.  We didn't use the bathroom but we noticed one of the customers going into the kitchen to get there.\u000a\u000aIt's a good value for the good food.  I hope to get back.  If it were on the west side of town I'd be there more often but it's almost to Boulder Highway.

VThis is the Erin Kenny Memorial CVS.  (For those who don't know the political scandal, you can Google it.)  My wife wanted to get a birthday card for her brother and some OTC medications for herself.  This was an easy stop on a busy, drive time Friday night.\u000a\u000aThe store was stoked well, and the staff was efficient.  There are some items I can find at CVS that aren't stocked by other chains, so I tend to stay with CVS.\u000a\u000aThis is not my normal CVS pharmacy, but it is a good one.

VThis proves that if I live long enough, I'll eventually stop at every Wells Fargo branch in Las Vegas.\u000a\u000aI was in the neighborhood, needed to stop at an ATM, so why not?  The people in front of me didn't dawdle, and I was in and out almost before I could check in.  Since there were no photos yet, I had to drive around front and get one.  That's an extra star for me.

VI needed a caffeine fix and this was right off the freeway.  I had noticed this location once when I was a passenger in a car and could look around and enjoy.  I filed away in my brain the location so I could stop here when I needed to.\u000a\u000aThe need arose yesterday.  I had hiked a little under four miles and this was a good place to stop for my daily Starbucks.\u000a\u000aI did not use the drive through.  The line was long.  Instead I parked in front and went inside.  The workers were very friendly and competent. I was in and out in no time at all and right back on the freeway heading to Summerlin.

VI was in the Chinatown area and needed to do some banking.  I stopped here at the drive through ATM.  The only problem is the area is like a maze.  You have to drive to the back, make a U, and then come up to the ATM.\u000a\u000aGetting out on Spring Mountain is iffy at best.  Then I found out I could exit via Arville.  Another time if I stop here again.

VWe decided to give the Grotto a try before a play in the Arts District.  As Dana said in his review, this is pretty standard fare in an over-priced casino restaurant.\u000a\u000aFirst our iced tea orders were taken and we were brought some slices of standard Italian bread with a container of olive oil for dipping. \u000a\u000aI ordered the special of the day, a risotto with lump crab.  My wife ordered the Pollo Romano, a chicken breast--"Romano crusted chicken scaloppine" and served with penne in a sugo rosa.  My wife's chicken was very good but there was more of a breading taste than romano to the chicken.  The penne was very bland.  A little salt helped that along.  My risotto was good and there was a fair amount of crab meat.\u000a\u000aWe shared a slice of mezza notte chocolate cake.  It's very rich and very good.  Lots of chocolate drizzled with chocolate.\u000a\u000aService was good.  Iced tea was refilled and the server took my Landry's card early and linked it to our order.  \u000a\u000aWhile you can sit along the windows by the pool, I didn't push for that.  The one table remaining along the window had a large man with a tattooed back almost pressed against the window.  Needless to say, that wasn't a view of the pool I wanted to have.\u000a\u000aThe place is quite noisy from both music, table talk, and people walking through this way to go to the Rush Tower or back the other way.  It wasn't a detriment to the dinner--just an observation.

VI have seen this show 5 times and I really enjoy it.  CT always has something current from the news worked into his show.  This makes for an ever changing show with some new things each time I've seen it along with some old standards.\u000a\u000aCT moves constantly during the show and he must almost exhaust himself before the end of the show.  His props and box of tricks are always filled with fun things.\u000a\u000aMy only problem with the show has nothing to do with CT, but I'd like to know who designed the theatre and its entrance/exit.  Wow, what a pain!  Still, seeing CT and his show is so worth it!

VI have usually gone to Regal Village Square, but today I wanted to see True Grit and it was not playing at Village Square.  I'm now hooked on Red Rock Stadium 16.  The colors are so much more vivid and the sound quality is stunning!  The seats are quite comfortable with their small rocking ability.\u000a\u000aThe staff was quite friendly--very welcoming and helpful.  The place still has that new appearance even though it's more than 5 years old.  It's great being able to go to a movie when it's not summertime and during the day when there are no little kiddies around, for the most part.  The 7 of us here today really enjoyed ourselves!\u000a\u000aI'll be back.

VWe stopped here for an early dinner last night after an appointment.  It's a typical Denny's that caters to people of my age--gray hairs.  \u000a\u000aI had the Super Bird, a turkey sandwich with cheese and bacon.  It's been a long time since I had one and it tasted very good.  My wife had an omelet and she was quite pleased with it.\u000a\u000aFor dessert I splurged and got their new Red Velvet Pancake Puppies Sundae.  Red Velvet dougnut holes with cream cheese frosting and vanilla ice cream.  Super!  Probably 1,000 calories in dessert alone.  :-)\u000a\u000aOur server, Travis, was excellent.  He was polite and very much on the ball with answering questions, taking the order, and refilling drinks.  I am a fan of this location!

VI was in the area recently and I had learned from fellow Yelpers about the bacon, chocolate bar, so I had to give it a try.\u000a\u000aHad I read Yelp first and specifically Misti's review, I would have known Vosges was on the first floor of the newer area of the Forum Shops.  Up to the top and then the circular escalators down to the first floor.  It certainly is out there.\u000a\u000aI bought one Mo's Dark Bacon Bar at $7.50.  Yes, that certainly is pricey.  While the bar tastes very nice, rich dark chocolate flavor with a somewhat salty taste from the bacon bits in the chocolate.  It's something I'll enjoy one chocolate square at a time.  The bar is also available in milk chocolate.\u000a\u000aFor those venturing here, the best way to get to this area is to park at valet.  Vosges is next to Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab Restaurant.  \u000a\u000aHappy chocolate hunting!

VI generally go to Costco for gas but this morning I was out early and Costco was not open yet so I went to Terrible's.  As for price, they're aptly named.  The gas is about 12 cents more than Costco so my not planning ahead wasn't too smart!\u000a\u000aI have been inside to get the Las Vegas Weekly or CityLife but this was my first purchase.

VThis is the Wells Fargo branch I usually visit.  It's conveniently located across the street from Costco so I can get gas a cash in a one, two swipe.\u000a\u000aThe only problem I sometimes have here is the wait in line if I have to do more than ATM transactions.  It can be slow.\u000a\u000aGood service and knowledgeable staff if you need to see one of the bank representatives in the offices there.

V4.5 stars\u000a\u000aI had dinner here on Sunday (1/22/12).  I made a reservation for 4 PM and was seated promptly.  I was asked by the maitre d' for my choice of watching football or watching people.  When I chose football, he showed me to a high top table in the front of the bar area.  Directly in front of me was a flat screen with the 49ers/Giants game.  During commercials, I could look out to the patio in the Forum Shoppes and people watch.\u000a\u000aSince I chose this early time, the menu given me was the lunch menu.  I was told I could order from the dinner menu if I wanted, but the server didn't go to get a dinner menu.  It was just as well.\u000a\u000aI ordered a cup of Stone Crab Bisque, the 12 ounce New York Strip Steak, and an individual portion of sautéed garlic spinach as my side.  For dessert, I got a half portion of their Peanut Butter Pie with hot fudge.\u000a\u000aThe soup was quite good.  The cup was just the right size.  The steak was superb!  It was charred on both sides and very rare inside--just as I ordered.  With it, they brought a small container of seasonings--ground salt, dried garlic, and other spices--to add to the steak.  It was great!!  The garlic spinach was also excellent.  Finally, the server told me that they had half-sized portions of dessert.  That's what I got, and it was more than enough to finish the meal.\u000a\u000aTwo reasons for the 1/2 star deduction from a full five.  One, since it was lunch, I guess, the bread selection wasn't a selection.  I was brought 2 small rolls, something I could buy in any grocery section.  That was quite disappointing.  Also, I waited about 10 minutes before the server first came to talk to me about ordering.  Since I was in no hurry, and I was watching the game, this was no problem.  Still, someone should have stopped by to assure me my server would be along.  It was busy, but not that busy.

VI stopped here for breakfast before going to CES and I'm glad I did.  I had to get the crème brulée French toast.  The toast was crisply browned and had syrup over the pieces and some banana slices.  It was very good!  The two pieces of sausage were good, but they needed more time heating.  They were luke warm.\u000a\u000aThe staff was great!  Fast, efficient, and with great attitudes.  This little gem is hidden away on Valley View in the warehouse and office area.  Had it not been for Yelp and an ad in a mailer from DiVine, I would never know this place existed.\u000a\u000aEdit:  I have to edit this review to add that this is way too much for one person for breakfast!  The French toast consisted of three thick slices of grilled bread.  It's enough to make two people happy, and I was sorry I wasn't going home so I could have them pack the pieces I couldn't finish instead of having it tossed.  For a price of $7 which includes the sausage, it can't be beaten!

VThis place earned the 5 stars.  Service was exceptional.  All the staff were smiling, no one walked by without checking my table to see if I needed anything or to remove a dirty dish or pick up and empty Sweet 'n Low packet.  My server was Haydee, and she was marvelous!\u000a\u000aI got the Ducasse Classics, the grand tasting menu.  Before ordering, I asked the area manager for my section of the restaurant--who took my order--if I could switch dessert because I didn't want to have the Baba Au Rhum with the small bottles of rum and cream alternately poured on the cake.  He had me look at their à la carte menu and pick any dessert from that--even the soufflé and he would substitute.  That's customer service and it's very accommodating. \u000a\u000aBread basket:  Standard types of bread.  One in particular had red bell pepper baked in it.  That was great!  There was regular butter in a small holder with two sides.  On the other side was a peanut butter spread.  It was excellent when you let it come to room temperature.  Heavenly flavors.\u000a\u000aThe courses:\u000a\u000aAmuse bouche:  Mango and shrimp coulis with sliced daikon and sliced red radish.  Very light and tasty.\u000a\u000aAppetizer:  Potato gnocchi with two varieties of mushrooms, sunchoke, parmigiano reggiano with veal jus.  There were a couple of baby escarole pieces that just set off the presentation of the items.  The gnocchi were absolutely the softest gnocchi I have had!  Superb!\u000a\u000aFish:  Roasted Maine lobster "au curry" on bed of coconut basmati rice.  There was not much curry flavor at all which would please some because there was certainly no flavor to overwhelm the delicate and sweet lobster. I tasted no coconut flavor in the basmati rice.     One small glitch here--there was a piece of lobster shell I bit into.  Now, if I were Scott Conant on "Chopped" I would have made that deep frown and made some remark about good chefs being careful about what they serve.  It happens and was no big deal.\u000a\u000aMeat:  Filet mignon Rossini.  A perfectly cooked filet--rare just as I asked with a large piece of delicate foie gras and several slices of black truffle.  It's the first truffle I ever had.  Before, someone merely waved some truffle above the food and said, "OK, here's your xxxxxxx with black truffle oil."  This was very tasty!\u000a\u000aPre-dessert:  A martini glass with a passion fruit base and a rum foam for a topping.  Very refreshing and an excellent palate cleanser.\u000a\u000aDessert:  miX Candy Bar.  A candy bar made with alternate layers of graham cracker and chocolate all dipped in chocolate.  There was some edible gold leaf on the candy bar.  With it was a lime coconut sorbet.  The lime was very dominating such that again I tasted no coconut.  They must use only a small amount of coconut flavoring.\u000a\u000aPost dessert, dessert:  A different server brings to your table some warm Madeleines in their mold fresh from the oven.  You remove your own Madeleines with your fingers.  You also get a small bowl of Nutella with a very small spoon to spread the heavenly hazelnut-chocolate goodness on your Madeleine.\u000a\u000aI think I'll make a return visit here when it's winter and it's darker early.  The city's lights were just coming on but it wasn't yet dark enough to fully enjoy the lights of this great city!

VIf the prices were lower, I'd give this place 5 stars, but I can't.  I had a Restaurant.com certificate and I made a reservation as per the certificate and came out tonight for dinner.  I was going to eat inside, but the patio was so inviting I decided to eat out.  It was lovely.  There's something that doesn't seem quite right about being in the middle of the desert eating next to a lake with a large boat.\u000a\u000aNow on to the food.  I ordered the crab cakes for an appetizer.  Wonderful!  The cakes had lots of real crab meat and not just shredded pieces.  The cakes are coated with panko crumbs and served with a curry and coconut sauce.  Also, hot rolls were brought out before I got the appetizer and there was a scoop of butter and a scoop of tapenade.\u000a\u000aThe main course was an 8 ounce filet cooked extra rare and topped with a  chimichurri sauce and served with garlic mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables.  The filet was cooked the way I like it--barely--and the potatoes and vegetables were great.  I finished the last bit of mashed potatoes with some of the tapenade.  Excellent!\u000a\u000aDessert?  Why certainly.   I had checked the menu online and had decided on the Godiva chocolate cheesecake.  My server, Stephanie, asked me about dessert and said, "I highly recommend the Godiva cheesecake."  She read my mind.  It was fantastic!\u000a\u000aSpeaking of Stephanie, service was excellent.  No one went by without helping.  Different servers removed a dirty dish, another refilled my iced tea, and others asked if I needed anything.  Just the kind of service everyone appreciates.\u000a\u000aThe view of the lake as the sun was setting was absolutely stunning.  The last rays on the mountains were to be enjoyed like fine food.  I am so glad I opted to eat on the patio.  It made a good meal that much better.  And that too is a reason for the higher prices.

VI stopped here with my neighbor this afternoon for an early dinner.  I had the Chicken Souvlaki and she had the Gyro plate.  We each requested no rice and extra salad and they were very accommodating.  Their tzatziki was excellent.  \u000a\u000aMy only complaint with any place like this is the plastic plates and dinnerware.  I know it's common in places like this, but it still is something I don't like.  I brought home a piece of baklava for dessert, and it was quite good.\u000a\u000aI will be back.  I'll probably do takeout the next time.

The staff is generally very competent.\u000a\u000aI went here today for some quick pick up of items, and I ended up getting more than I planned because they are now stocking a kind of cheese I love.

VI've come here several times to see shows or lectures in the theatre section of the library.  The seating is comfortable and all seats have good views of the stage.\u000a\u000aI was here tonight for the Yelp cosponsored The Law vs the Mob series each Tuesday in January.  The lecture was excellent!

VThe service in this store was poor yesterday.  After visiting Dr. Hammargren's house yesterday, I stopped here for a thirst quencher before going home.  There were four employees working yet it took over 5 minutes to get a drink.  The person making the fraps was overwhelmed by the drive through and the others didn't help her at all.\u000a\u000aSurprising for me to give a Starbucks only 2 stars.  I won't stop here again.,

VReally it should be 2.5 stars.  They have the dumbest set up for a drive through.  It runs the length of the regular parking area.  If the line for the drive through is long, they block parking spaces and you can't get in nor out!  I ended parking away from the store and walking.  \u000a\u000aService was fast and polite!  I think I'd skip this place for another McDonald's unless I really needed the coffee or food.

VI ordered one of the day's specials - pork Veracruz.  It was tender, juicy, cubed pork loin with raisins, onions, olives, and tomatoes.  It was a great sauce and I wish I had some bread to sop up the juices left after everything was gone.  I finished it like I would any tasty broth.\u000a\u000aDessert was an order of cream filled churros.  They came with a side of ice cream drizzled with caramel and chocolate.  Delicious!\u000a\u000aThe restaurant is really a comfortable place.  Service was very good.  The man and woman helped each other and they were very pleasant and polite.  This was my first visit, but it won't be my last.\u000a\u000aMake sure you check the specials board when you come in the door.

VLovely lady in green, you have graced the sides of so many cups of coffee and tea -- I have been unfaithful.  I was lead astray by those Yelpers I've been hangin' with online, and, sweetheart, let me tell you, I'm not going to stop!  Today was just the first!!\u000a\u000aI tried Boba for the first time today at Easy Life and wow is it good!  I have read the reviews on Yelp for a few weeks now.  Since this isn't too far from home, I was going to stop before, but I'm always going to/from somewhere and never did stop.\u000a\u000aI got the coconut white tea with boba.  This is absolutely delicious and I'm still enjoying it as I write this review.  I was such a babe in the woods, I didn't realize I needed the large tube straw.\u000a\u000aThe women working the counter were quite helpful and helped lead me as I strayed from my green lady.\u000a\u000aI will be back.  This is such a great drink for a day like today that has temperatures above 100.\u000a\u000aThanks fellow Yelpers!  And, it's all your fault that I was unfaithful!

VBetween two shows last night, I had about 45 minutes to kill so I drove the short distance here to get a McFlurry.  For me, McDonald's has become a place to get a  side salad or a quick dessert.  Dessert it was.\u000a\u000aThe drive through was packed, so I parked at the convenience store parking and went inside.  The staff was very friendly.  The only issue I had was with adding to my Arch card account.  They couldn't remember how to do it.  After awhile, a light bulb went off and I had some money loaded on the card.\u000a\u000aI got my Oreo McFlurry and I sat in the restaurant to enjoy it.  It was good--typical McDonald's--it's the same at each location.  The restaurant was relatively clean.  There was a table that needed clearing but other than that, it was neat.  There's also free wifi which made checking my email a breeze.  It was very snappy.\u000a\u000aThere are some pictures on the walls that look like they are made of jigsaw puzzle pieces. One was of Ray Croc.  I couldn't tell if they were real puzzle pieces or if the art had been designed to just look that way.\u000a\u000aI'll be back when I'm in the area of Commercial Center and need a soft ice cream fix.

It was difficult trying to find staff to ask a question.  \u000a\u000aThere are so many other places that are stocked with many more things.  There's also the little thing called the internet.  There's really no reason to waste my time here anymore!\u005c\u000a\u000aAnd this is a Sears Grand?  That's surely misnamed!

VA friend recommended the Cafe as being one of the best places to have breakfast and I decided to check it out and see if he was correct.  Yes, he was!\u000a\u000aThe place was very busy when I got here about 10 AM on a Tuesday morning.  The hostess asked me if I wanted a table and I asked if they had a counter.  They do and she took me there immediately.  The counter area was relatively empty.  From where I sat, it  looked like the place was once a pizza joint because of the oven along the wall there.\u000a\u000aRegardless, I was given a menu and brought a mug of coffee very quickly.  I then checked out the pancake/waffle section but they all seemed like they'd be larger breakfasts that I wanted to get.\u000a\u000aI settled on the Brooklyn Benedict which consists of two basted eggs on an open faced bagel with turkey cubes, spinach, and melted Swiss cheese all topped with Hollandaise.  It was excellent!  You are given a choice of bagel and I opted for the sesame bagel.  The combination of flavors--the turkey, Swiss cheese, and spinach--was wonderful!  The bene also came with potatoes.  I could have had fruit but why spoil a good breakfast?\u000a\u000aCoffee was refilled often and I was asked if I wanted a cup to go at no charge.  The staff was very accommodating and service was top notch.\u000a\u000aI wouldn't hesitate to return for breakfast here.  It is very good and they have a large variety of breakfast dishes.

VA-OK is the way I'd describe this Speedee Mart.  I usually get gas at Costco, but there were none where I was going to be last night.  I stopped at this Speedee Mart.  Their price was competitive with nearby stations, and it was only a few cents more per gallon than Costco would have been.\u000a\u000aI was in and out in just under 5 minutes.  That's speedy!

VMy wife needed new shoes and Foot Solutions in Summerlin had closed.  We went here yesterday and she got the shoes she wanted.  The person who helped her was very thorough and professional.\u000a\u000aWhen I checked in on Yelp, I saw there was a Yelp deal.  It turns out to be a $15 discount on what you buy.  When I knew she had found something she wanted, I bought the deal and redeemed it a few minutes later!  Pretty slick, Yelp and good advertising Foot Solutions.\u000a\u000aOne other thing, we were told that this store was in a plaza 1/2 mile from where it really was.  When I couldn't find it in the first mall, I pulled it up on Yelp and I let the map lead me there.\u000a\u000aAll in all, I'm a fan.

VI'm getting ready to get a new car and I wanted to keep the trade in out of the discussion with the dealership.  My hiking friends recommended I go to Carmax.  That was a good recommendation. \u000a\u000aIt takes about 45 minutes and they drive and evaluate your car on the lift, too.  In a short time, I was called into the office to see Sylvester again and he gave me the value they'd give me for my car.  It was in the blue book range, and I will accept it when I close the deal on my new car.\u000a\u000aThis makes getting rid of your old car so much easier and you can do a straight forward deal with the new car dealer.  It makes it a much easier way of doing business.  I always hated the "Well, we can only give you $xxxx for your car because..."  This takes all that off the table.\u000a\u000aCarmax is A-OK!

VThis is a review for a private event in the Claddagh Room at Hennessey's.  About 25 of us got together last night for an internet meet.  It's a group of people who post on an internet discussion board about Las Vegas.  I have known some of these people for over 10 years.\u000a\u000aWhen the leader of the discussion board was trying to find a place that would accommodate that large a group of people, she gave Hennessey's a call and they offered us the Claddagh Room for three hours at no charge and they supplied a bartender for our group.\u000a\u000aI've been to Hennessey's for two shows in the past few years and they were in the Claddagh Room.  It's a pleasant place with wood tables and chairs.  We were able to mingle or sit and talk.\u000a\u000aI got a diet Coke that came in a small Mason jar with a handle.  The drink was $3.50 but there were unlimited refills.  The bartender was a very outgoing young lady and she was a pleasure!\u000a\u000aHennessey's Claddagh Room was the perfect place for our meet.

VI'm conflicted about writing this review because I was going to give a lower rating.   I was so hungry after spending 3.5 hours volunteering at the aid station for the Viva Bike Vegas 2012 ride that I could have eaten a take out menu and thought it was good.\u000a\u000aThis was my first time here and I had researched Yelp reviews and their online menu.  I ordered from the take out window one order of chicken lettuce wraps and a large hot and sour soup.  The lettuce wraps were very good.  I am a salt lover, but the sauce made the wraps salty even for me.  But, I still enjoyed them.\u000a\u000aThe hot and sour soup had a rich taste but I'm not used to having ground meat in hot and sour soup.  It's generally small slices of pork.  The texture was a bit of a turn off and I didn't think the soup was that spicy.\u000a\u000aMy biggest issue was service.  I realize I was a walk in at 4:30 on a Saturday evening.  There were four people in the restaurant at the time.  There were some take out orders to be made but there was never less than three cooks working behind the counter and before I got my meal, there were 5 total.  I probably waited 15 minutes.  I saw the one cook pick up and handful of rice sticks and toss it into the take out box--no gloves, no tongs--just bare hands.  Also, the soup was ladled into the take out container and just left on the metal shelf for 10 minutes while the other things were being prepared.\u000a\u000aWhen the counter critter brought my bag, she apologized for the long wait.  I watched this place as it was being built and never stopped.  That's been about 10 years.  I guess I can wait again before I return.  The lettuce wraps saved the rating from being 2 stars.

VI was to this outlet many years ago and was somewhat disappointed to be eating out of a paper lined, plastic basket.  My friends Amelinda L. clued me into their boneless wings Thursday special and I decided to do take out last night.  Boneless wings are $.60 each on Thursdays.\u000a\u000aIt's only about 3 miles, so it's not a drive for me to go here.  I din't order online or phone my order in.  When I got there, the young woman at the register walked me through the process and answered my questions.  A minimum of 4 wings per flavor must be ordered.  I ended up getting 6 spicy garlic for my wife and 6 of the classic hot for myself.  I also ordered a basket of fries which she assured me was great for two people sharing.  She was correct!\u000a\u000aThe cashier told me it would be 10 to 15 minutes.  I started to play Angry Birds and before I could swear twice, the order was ready.  It was probably 5 minutes maximum.  I brought the order home and we dug in.  I was so hungry that I forgot to take a photo of the food.  Next time.\u000a\u000aThe wings were very good and the sauces were just right.  There was a nice bite to my lips from the hot sauce.  The fries ameliorated that heat a bit and I had a nice mug of iced tea at hand.\u000a\u000aI am a fan and I think I'll come back here on a Thursday again.  For less than $14, dinner for 2.  Not bad at all.  And tasty dinner for two.  And, I didn't have to cook!\u000a\u000aAmelinda L, thanks once again!

VI was in the area and my friendly Starbucks app told me the address and Siri led me here.  There's a drive through, but I parked and went inside anyway.  I like the personal touch better,\u000a\u000aMy order was taken quickly and was made immediately.  The staff was personable and best of all, I used one of my free drinks from Buckys for my afternoon caffeine fix.  That's what I call a win win.\u000a\u000aIf I'm in the area, I'd definitely stop here.  It's not too far to go from/to the 215.

VI did a long bike ride today, and I knew when I got back to the car, I would need to head for the nearest Starbucks.  I made a few taps on my GPS and this was the closest around.\u000a\u000aThis outlet has no drive through which is OK with me.  I'd rather speak with people in person than through the box.  Service was a little slow because the woman working the register was too interested in commenting on a friend's lack of looking well.  \u000a\u000aThe barista had the drink amde almost as soon as I told the talker what I wanted.  He was on top of things.

VI stopped here on the way home to pick up some sweets to have that night and to put some in the freezer to have another day.\u000a\u000aFort such a little shop, there were so many different things from which to choose.  I walked from table to table looking at the cakes, breads, and pastures and reading the names on them.  Some were missing names.\u000a\u000aIn the long run, I got a small bag of 3 French style macarons, a slice of chocolate cake, and a small bag of mini cinnamon rolls.  The macarons were OK but the filling was definitely not French.  It was a cream like filling.  Regardless, they were good.  My wife had the cake slice and liked it.  The best of the three items was the package of cinnamon rolls.  They're very good!\u000a\u000aParking here is awful.  After getting into the lot, I found no spaces available and a number of cars circling the lot waiting for an open spot.  I almost drove out and away.  Instead, I went to the Chinatown Mall and parked right next to Spring Mountain Road away from the businesses in the Mall.\u000a\u000aI'm not sure I'd stop in again.  There's nothing special for me to bring me in.

VReview for Spring Restaurant Week 2012 menu:\u000a\u000aI went to Envy tonight for the last night of Restaurant Week for this spring.  The choices were limited which is to be expected for a RW menu.  The bread basket was quite nice with slices of French bread, white chocolate walnut bread, and some breadsticks. \u000a\u000aCourse 1:  I opted for the Butternut Squash Soup with brown sugar croutons.  This was excellent!  When I took some soup with a crouton, I had both a somewhat sweet taste mixed with the flavor of the squash.  Truly inspired thinking on the part of the chef to come up with this combination.\u000a\u000aBefore Course 2, my server, Joshua, brought me a small triple dish that had sea salts from different parts of the world.  The white was from Australia, the black from Hawaii, and the pink was Murray River salt.  He urged me to try the salt but to use care because it can be overdone.  It was fun trying the different flavors with pieces of steak.  Australian was my favorite.\u000a\u000aCourse 2:  Of course I chose the filet mignon.  Why get salmon at a steak house?  The steak was anchored on some very thin slices of sweet potato.  The steak was cooked correctly.  I ordered it black and blue and it almost was.  Done a bit more than I like because it wasn't blue enough.\u000a\u000aCourse 3:  There was no choice here but who needed one?  RW dessert is triple chocolate lava cake.  It was outstanding.  The chocolate was rich.  It was also bittersweet chocolate which was a good choice to keep the overall sweetness in check.  There was a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  Great end to the meal.\u000a\u000aA couple of things prevent me from giving a higher rating.  I'm not sure if the bread was warmed in a microwave but it seemed that way.  When I decided to have a second slice of that wonderful white chocolate walnut, it had dried quickly and had a bit of a crust on it.  This doesn't happen with fresh bread unless it's microwaved for heating.  As mentioned before, the steak was a little too done for me.  Finally, as another reviewer noted, you have to take into account the beautiful surroundings, the good service, and the portion size vis à vis the price and Envy comes up a bit short.  I realize this is an RW menu, but when comparing it to other places I went during Restaurant Week, Envy couldn't compare with some of the others.\u000a\u000aThe service was excellent.    Joshua, was very knowledgable and helpful.  Props to Chef Michael for stopping by the table to chat with me and ask for feedback about the meal.  \u000a\u000aThis was a good experience, but I'm not sure if I'd return.  I checked the regular menu and I'm sure my wife would be happier where her choices were more numerous.

VI stopped in for some CD/DVD paper covers.  As soon as I walked in the door, an associate asked if she could help me.  She took me to the spot where the covers were and I was on my way to the register in 1 minute.  +1\u000a\u000aAt the register, the woman could not scan my key tag for the Depot and she couldn't get my information with my phone number.  She didn't type my ID number that would have been scanned if their scanner had worked.  She also said I owed more when she counted wrong.  -1\u000a\u000aIt was an OK visit the the + and - canceling each other.

VI can't review the entertainment venues yet.  I stopped yesterday to add to my ticket drawer for upcoming shows.  Since it's still a construction area, I had to wait for security to walk me to the box office.\u000a\u000aThe grounds are beautiful.  There's one problem with the box office.  To accommodate people with disabilities, the speaker in the window is placed lower than a normal position for a person standing.  The person taking my order couldn't here me well unless I bent down and spoke more directly into the speaker area.  It was also difficult to understand what he was saying because the box office area is all marble and the sound of other people at another window echoed throughout the small area.  \u000a\u000aSeeing the buildings and Symphony Park up close for the first time was exciting and I'm looking forward to the opening.  It seems like it's taken forever to build this place, but at last it's ready to shine.  I hope within a few weeks I'll be back to raise the rating to 5 stars.\u000a\u000aWelcome to Las Vegas, Smith Center!

VEven though there are still glitches to be worked out, I have to up my rating to 5 stars.  I attended my first concert at the Smith Center last night--Michael Feinstein's Sinatra Project.  \u000a\u000aThe building is beautiful.  Next time, I'll go early and just spend some time looking at the art both outside and inside.  Reynolds Hall is amazing.  Seating just over 2,000, the theatre appears more intimate than that because of the multi-tier design.  Acoustics are superb, and the skylight is visually stunning.  \u000a\u000aGetting in and out via Symphony Park Avenue was a bit slow, but it is opening week.  This was only the third regular concert in the venue.  \u000a\u000aThe Smith has an ambitious schedule for this inaugural year with 50+ events scheduled between its opening on March 12th until the middle of August.  \u000a\u000aThis is a venue for which Las Vegas can be very proud.  I'll be back often.

VI got what I wanted after looking for quite awhile--both for someone to get help and then trying to find the place she told me to go.  The aisles are not too well marked for items like a grocery store aisle, so I had to search for another time.\u000a\u000aI would advise bringing your spouse who probably knows a hell of a lot more than you do and let them help you!

VI had a comp ticket for the Tournament of Kings and having lived here for 12 years and never having seen the show, it was about time I got to the Excalibur to see it.\u000a\u000aThere was a long line for entering the arena, but it went quickly and they have plenty of people working to get you seated.  Shortly after being seated in Ireland, a server came around to take our drink order.  I went with the diet soda option.\u000a\u000aJust before the show was about to begin, she came along with a pitcher of hot tomato soup that she poured into everyone's bowl warning each of us as she went along that it was hot.  Indeed it was--and tasty.  Next came our dinner, a plate with a Cornish hen, a stalk of broccoli, and two red skinned small potatoes.  There was also a biscuit. After dinner, the server brought around an apple tart, something like a Pop Tart but much better.  The dinner was quite enjoyable and there were two napkins and a wet cloth in a sealed holder for cleaning your hands because there are no utensils.  \u000a\u000aThe show was good.  You could see the lances break away and pieces of balsa wood material fall to the dirt floor and you could see the pre-arranged fight choreography.  The acting was OK.  You could see the kings fall just as the lance was about to hit.  Some were better than others in making their falls look more real.  Our Irish king couldn't fight for anything and we were almost cheering for the bad guy so we'd have one win under our belts.\u000a\u000aIt was a fun show, but it really is one for kids.  The dinner is good, the show is good, and the price is reasonable.  This is one of the Las Vegas attractions that was meant for the younger set.  Take them and enjoy the show!

VWhat to do after a strenuous hike with a friend  at Red Rock Canyon?  Go to Rachel's Kitchen and have some food to restore some strength.  After a hike on Monday, 1/30, that's exactly what we did.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Curry chicken wrap and my friend got their multigrain pancakes with both bananas and chocolate chips.  The wrap is a chicken curry salad with romaine lettuce, cucumbers, and mayo in a whole wheat tortilla.  You have a choice of mixed green salad, French fries, sweet potato fried or onion rings as a side.  I, of course, took the healthy route and got the French fries.\u000a\u000aThe wrap was very good.  I also got some iced tea.  It's a serve yourself counter on the side.  They had regular and passion fruit.  The passion fruit tea was very tasty.\u000a\u000aMy friends pancakes were quite good he reported.  The pancakes came with a side of fresh fruit.  After a graveyard shift at a local hospital and a tough hike, the pancakes were enough to carb up his diet to keep going.\u000a\u000aAs Candace noted, the seating is close.  The tables are small and there are a fairly good number of them in that relatively small space.  When it's warmer. I'll have to go for breakfast and eat on the patio!\u000a\u000aI've been wanting to try Rachel's for awhile and I'm glad I did.  Their new location puts them next to a Starbucks.  Does life get any better than that?

VWhat's not to like about a baseball park with palm trees?  Cashman Field may have a few years behind it, but it's still a good place to see a game.\u000a\u000aParking is easy whether you park on the hill or in the area parallel to the convention space.  Parking is $4 which is a bargain for most places.\u000a\u000aThe proximity to the freeway makes it easy for most people to arrive/leave from the ballpark.\u000a\u000aI am a fan of Cashman Field.

VI saw the Titanic exhibition when it was at the Trop, but I wanted to come back and see it at the Luxor with its enhanced room and display.  Mainly, I wanted to see "The Big Piece," a 15 ton section of the Titanic's hull that was raised in 1998 from 2 1/2 miles down and with glass still in one of the portholes.  This was not at the Trop and it's worth it just to see this.\u000a\u000aI enjoyed reading all the interpretive signs and once again, I was fascinated by the dishes that were retrieved from the ocean bottom lined up like they were sitting in a giant dishwasher.\u000a\u000aI like that you still get a card with the name of a Titanic passenger and you can check the board at the end of the tour to see if they survived.  The person on my card died but his son survived.  Interesting story and I'll do some research to see if I can find more information.

VWe had a get together of online friends here yesterday.  The thing that keeps this from getting 4 stars is the fact we waited until 4:15 for them to open.  Their posted hours begin at 4.  Someone in the group finally got through on the phone to someone who unlocked the front door and opened the place.\u000a\u000aWe were given Napoleon's Retreat, the private room, as a quiet place for the 15 people to get away from the loudness of the main room.  \u000a\u000aCongratulations to the staff for turning a losing moment into something positive.  But you know, when you're advertised opening time is 4 PM, you should have the doors opened then or shortly thereafter--not 15 minutes later.

VI went to a show at the Mirage last night and decided to have dinner there.  I made a reservation for Fin.  The room is a very beautiful one with a decor that gives different area a modicum of privacy.\u000a\u000aI got the prix fixe menu.  You automatically get egg drop soup but then you have choices.  For my appetizer, I ordered pot stickers, my main course selection was Kung Pao chicken, for rice I got the vegetable fried rice, and for dessert I got the mango pudding.\u000a\u000aThe egg drop soup was good but it needed some salt--at least for me.  There are no salt or pepper shakers on the table and I was OK eating it as it was.  It was a good soup with some small pieces of small broccoli florets.  That was great for texture.  The pot stickers were very good and the sauce served with them was a winner.  The Kung Pao chicken was good.  A good amount of chicken, quite a few peanuts, and a few red peppers but not enough to give the dish much zing.  It's not supposed to have zing so it was made properly.  Portion size was good but not I need a take out box size.  The fried rice was a whole bowl of individual grains of rice, fluffy and tasty.  Finally, the mango pudding for dessert was great!  It stole the show.  The pudding had fresh chunks of mango on it.  What a good way to end the meal.\u000a\u000aService was very good throughout the evening.  I never had less than a half glass of iced tea when a server was there to refill it.  The pace of the meal was good.  The only thing about service that I would fault was the lack of removing empty Sweet 'n Low packets from the table.  Cleaning paper like that off a table when you come to add more iced tea or clear dishes should be a no brainer.  I was surprised that a restaurant like this would have that down pat, but they don't\u000a\u000aI rate Fin 3 stars.  It was A-OK.  I know I could have gone west on Spring Mountain Road a little more than a mile and I could have had the same meal for at least half what I paid.  The ambience wouldn't be the same.  This was one of those special times when eating in the hotel was the option I chose.  Another time, I'd eat in Chinatown.

VI came here for Roger's UYE.  Other than standing at the entrance to see what the bowling venue looked like after a movie, I had never been here.  \u000a\u000aThe price was right--$1.50 per game starting at 10 PM.  This price is available Sunday through Thursday and the alleys are open until 2 AM.\u000a\u000aThe lanes are in great shape.  Although we had a problem a few times with the one lane freezing after throwing the first ball, we just got around it by pushing the reset button.  We got one shot at doing better.\u000a\u000aService at check in was very friendly.  Since I'm of that certain age when you get discounts for not dying yet, I can do this price most weekdays bowling between 8 AM and Noon.  Not bad.  I really should go more often so I can shine--sort of--instead of doing as poorly as I did Monday night.  Practice makes better as my saying goes.

VI went to the Bagel Café to try some of their bagels after a disappointing purchase at a different shop nearby.  I got a half dozen, assorted flavors - 2 salt (lots of salt on both sides) - 2 everything, and 1 jalapeño, and 1 sun dried tomato.  After trying a salt bagel this morning, I'm hooked.  A salt bagel is what I use to judge a bagel shop and this one was perfect. \u000a\u000aI had quick service at the store and the price was right.  They have a new customer!

VWhenever I go to the Bellagio to see the Conservatory or the Gallery of Fine art, I find myself ending up here for a gelato fix.  The service is very quick here, and there are plenty of tables to enjoy your treat.  I also find the people watching to be wonderful  With the pool entrance just a few steps away, I can enjoy my frozen delight while watching some lovely ladies in their bikinis.

VI was going to a show last night and Ocean One Bar and Grille popped up on Groupon and I got one.  I have walked around the Miracle Mile Shops looking at the menus of various places, but until now, I hadn't eaten in this area.  The Groupon gave me the excuse to go.\u000a\u000aI had a reservation for 5 PM, unneeded as it turned out.  I looked at the menu while my server, Tracy, brought my iced tea.  For a starter, I ordered the sesame tuna.  It was  5 pieces of tuna, previously seared and arranged on a bed of seaweed salad with wasabi cream and pickled ginger topping the salad.  The tuna was dry.  It was just stored too long before being used.  The plating was certainly nice but the dryness was very noticeable.\u000a\u000aFor the main, I ordered the filet, cooked blue.  The server returned from another table and checked with me to make sure that's what I wanted before putting the order in to the kitchen.  See the photo to see that it was cooked the way I wanted it.  A plus vote for that.  Along with the filet were some mashed potatoes and some yellow and green squash stings with carrot strings.  The vegetables were very good--crisp and not overdone.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I got the Peanut butter cheesecake.  It was good and had a nice peanut butter flavor.  \u000a\u000aOverall, the meal was OK.  I'm glad I tried it once but I probably wouldn't come back.  I was disappointed with the tuna appetizer.  Without the Groupon, the dinner would be very similar in pricing to some of the steakhouses at Strip hotels.  There are better choices with nicer atmospheres.

VI like Bass Pro shops as a place just to look around and enjoy the sporting goods and other items.  I came here yesterday to look for hiking shorts like I bought last year.  They didn't have the kind I wanted, but it was still a pleasant stop.\u000a\u000aI took the opportunity to walk around the boat area and marvel at the prices and be glad I didn't own one nor had to pay for it.  This whole store is a visual feast.  Lots of good people watching, a great selection of clothes (well almost), and surprisingly an area with a large selection of hot sauces.\u000a\u000aI'll be back and I hope they restock the shorts I got before.

VThis has been on my radar for some time, but I never thought to go here.  This afternoon, it was a planned event all along.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant is really decorated nicely.  The layout is good and I liked it from when I walked in.  There was one couple in the restaurant when I came in.  At first I thought they were closed.\u000a\u000aI ordered and got a Thai iced coffee while I was checking in on Yelp and looking over the menu.  Not wanting to fall back on curry again, I decided on something completely different for me - the garlic, pepper with chicken - spiciness level 7 out of 10.\u000a\u000aThe dinner was very good.  It's served with rice - I took the white rice.  The portion was too much to finish and my server packed the leftovers in two containers.  The spiciness could have been higher.  I should have asked for some hot peppers.  From the Yelp reviews, I thought they were heavy with the hotness, when for my taste, they are not.  8 or 9 next time.  The garlic flavor was very good!\u000a\u000aService was quite good!  I would expect no less when there are only 2 tables with customers in the whole place but I've had other experiences with the same circumstances.\u000a\u000aI will come back here, and I think their garlic will get my wife's seal of approval!

VI've wanted to go to First Friday for a long time but I never seemed to get there.  Friday night, I had a ticket for the play "The Mineola Twins" at the Art Square Theatre in the heart of the downtown Arts District and thus I was thrust into the First Friday action.\u000a\u000aI didn't go as early as I could have to get a good parking spot and I opted not to take one of the shuttles.  I scouted a couple of side streets and ended up parking at Gass and 3rd which gave me only a 6 block walk.\u000a\u000aFrom the moment I got the vibe of the crowd, I knew I was hooked on First Friday.  It was enjoyable seeing the street performers, looking at some of the art (wow, some of it looks like something one of my 6th grade students did years ago), and smelling the most incense I've smelled since I was in grad school.  It was also a fun diversion to see Metro cuffing a guy on the hood of one of their cruisers.\u000a\u000aI was on a mission to find an ice cream truck but alas there was none to be found.  I ended up getting a deep fried Twinkie from one of the vendors.  No need to go inside the Mermaids Casino on Fremont Street now.  It was surprisingly good, but it's not something I'd buy on a regular basis.\u000a\u000aI will be back to First Friday when I can spend some more time and enjoy the vibes some more.  If December is an OK weather night, I'll be there.  It was great fun!

VThis review is for the euphemistically named "Guest Services" kiosk near the food court.\u000a\u000aI am not one to relish giving one star reviews, but in this case, I am anxious to get this review done.  I went to the Galleria to buy a gift certificate for a friend who recently retired.  There was no one at Guest Services.  No sign such as "Out to Lunch" (literally or figuratively) or "Be Back in 15 minutes), nothing!\u000a\u000aAfter waiting for about 5 minutes, I went to a nearby jewelry store and asked if there was another mall office.  No, that's it.  I waited another 10 minutes and no one showed.  I bet if I had gone behind the counter, something I could have easily done, security and other guest services associates would have descended on the kiosk.\u000a\u000aI left and drove to Chinatown where I got the friend a gift card for an Asian grocery.  That's what I should have done in the first place.

VI don't do much shopping here, but I have been to the V Variety Theatre and the Saxe Theatre several times.  The only store I regularly go to is Sur La Table.  I could just look at all the cooking things there for hours.\u000a\u000aI also enjoy going there to people watch.  It's interesting to observe the tourist in its natural habitat here in Las Vegas.  They wear shorts even when it's 60 outside.  They go without coats in the middle of winter.\u000a\u000aThe Miracle Mile Shops provides me with a great space to do this people watching - right under the glittery mask.  I also go to the Coffee Bean and use their free wifi.\u000a\u000aThere's much to praise the Miracle Mile Shops for.  It is a neat place!

VIf I could remove the A from the A-OK explanation for three stars, I would be happier with my rating.  The meal was OK but not an A-OK which to me implies something better.\u000a\u000aWe waited to be seated for about 15 minutes which was OK except for the fact that there were several empty tables.  They're just understaffed enough they can't clear all the tables to accommodate the arriving guests.\u000a\u000aOur server, Leo, was a personable young man and answered questions we had.  He's the reason this isn't the two star rating I'd normally give for the food.\u000a\u000aLe Burger Brasserie--good burgers and such.  No, not really.  They're burgers made from frozen patties.  They are so uniform in diameter and thickness they have to be packaged ahead of time.  I asked for mine rare but it was more toward medium rare.  My wife asked for hers medium and hers was cooked the same as mine.\u000a\u000aThe burgers were not at all juicy.  They look pretty, so to speak, because they come in their paper-lined metal basket with the side of lettuce and tomato.  I got a bleu burger and my wife got the Le Paris, a burger with brie cheese, caramelized onion, bacon.  My burger had bleu cheese and bacon with a half avocado on the side.  You also get to choose from among 4 or 5 options for the kind of bun you want for the burger.  When I leave a burger place and the things that stick in my head about the meal are the avocado and the bleu cheese, then it wasn't a great burger experience.  \u000a\u000aFor dessert, we shared the beignets, 5 small rounds filled with mascarpone and served with chocolate dipping sauce and whipped cream.  They were OK, but nothing I'll remember.\u000a\u000aSpending an hour and a half having a burger is also too long.  It turned out to be alright because I was watching the college football game on their big screen.  We got out in just enough time to walk to the Jubilee! Theatre for our show and we had some time to spare.  \u000a\u000aI'd recommend going anywhere else for a burger.  I know these are Strip prices but give me something a little more worthy of the price you're charging.

VMy review of Club Madrid is for its use as a concert venue.  I went here last night for the Jose Feliciano concert.  The seating was arranged in almost a semi-circle fashion in front of its proscenium stage.  Last night, the seating was arranged into four sections.\u000a\u000aThe things I liked were the chairs were padded and weren't simply folding metal chairs which become tiresome during a concert.  Also, they were not attached to each other with self-locking plastic ties--again something than some venues do.  The negatives of the seating were that the chairs were close together and while there was plenty of legroom under the chair in front, you couldn't cross your legs without whacking the person sitting next to you.\u000a\u000aFor the concert last night, the sound was excellent.  The sound people were on their toes and kept things at the correct level all night.  I also noticed the number of lights in the club and watched as they were used very effectively for the concert.\u000a\u000aThis is an OK venue for a concert.

VReview for casino only:  I have a like/dislike feeling for the casino.  The casino is relatively small and easy to navigate once you know the layout and develop tricks for getting from one area to another the quickest way.\u000a\u000aI do like some of the games they have in video poker, but they have a limited inventory in my favorite-Spin Poker.  I also find that there seems to be a lot of older women who like to smoke and bang the keys.  No wonder so many machines show problems with their buttons.\u000a\u000aGenerally, the casino is a fairly quiet place.  Today it was not so quiet.  it just got to me today.  With so many other choices, this is one of the last places I choose to go.  I was here today to meet friends for dinner and the Promenade Cafe.  Otherwise, I wouldn't have been near the place.

VI decided to stop into Bill's before it closes and have a look around for the memories.  I used to come here periodically to see Big Elvis, but when he moved to another Caesars' property, there's no reason to come here.\u000a\u000aI noticed when I was there that they had the Slush Bar and they have Slush Pong in the evenings.  Big Elvis' space is now used at times for karaoke.  \u000a\u000aAs always, even though it's an odd garage, it was easier to park at Bill's and walk through and over to the Flamingo than fight the construction of Project Linq in the back.\u000a\u000aOn the way back through Bill's, a gentleman was singing "If I Were a Rich Man" for his karaoke.  With that, I said a fond farewell with a smile to good old Bill's, a.k.a. the Barbary Coast.  Adios!

VI decided to try this spot based on the reviews of some of my Yelp friends.  I started off with some warm, salted edamame.  That's warm and salted.  Very tasty.  Then I had the spicy kabocha coconut soup with pumpkin seeds.  A most flavorful soup and I'll be back if only for the soup!!!  I followed this up with the vegetable tempura plate - a melange of broccoli, pumpkin, avocado, asparagus, zucchini, onion, and shiitake mushroom.  The vegetables were ever so lightly coated and the dipping liquid was superb! \u000a\u000aHow could I leave without trying a roll?  I couldn't so I ordered the kholester roll, which according to the menu is kimchee and cream cheese stuffed jalapeno tempura.  It was also very good.\u000a\u000aDessert you ask?  How could I?  I went to have a light meal and ended up eating like a sumo. But it was so worth it!  Thanks, Misti!\u000a\u000aNote:  the edamame is not complimentary as it is at most Japanese places.

VI am a fan of this showroom in the Four Queens Hotel.  Even though it's a fairly large room, it does have a feeling of being cozy and intimate.  The staff at the box office and the theatre itself have always been very friendly.\u000a\u000aThere is a bar in the left front of the showroom as you face the stage and there's waitress service during the show.\u000a\u000aThis is a good venue in downtown.

VI've been to the Courtyard Café many times as a tourist and less as a resident.  We met friends who are staying at the orleans for dinner last night and they chose the Café.  I got the Cobb salad wrap with Cajun fries.  Wonderful!  My wife had the chicken cutlet and she liked it.  Our two friends were pleased with their meals, so it was a happy table.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, two of us got the chocolate brownie dream.  It was a good size brownie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and some whipped cream.  Perfect ending to the meal.\u000a\u000aThis place merits the 4th star for their Cajun fries alone!  That certainly kicks everything up a notch!

VI have seen Matsuri four times beginning with their time at the Riviera and then the Sahara.  I have not yet seen the show at the IP, but I don't doubt that it's just as good as ever.\u000a\u000aI dare you to watch this show without smiling and/or laughing.  These young performers are excellent, and they give 110% to put on a great show.\u000a\u000aI don't think anyone would leave this show not being impressed with what they had seen.

VI was on my way yesterday (4-16-10) to try Bosa 1 on Jones, but when I got there, I found they close at 3:30 on Friday afternoons.  I headed to Spring Mountain Road to do some exploring.  As I came alongside the Pacific Asian Plaza, I remembered a friend saying there was a great Malaysian restaurant there.  There was Penang on the second floor.\u000a\u000aI got an order of Curry Puffs for an appetizer.  I wondered what was taking so long. The puffs are 4 good-sized pastries filled with a very good ground potato, chicken, tofu mixture with a curry seasoning.  They were very hot from the oven - hence the wait.  They were excellent.\u000a\u000aFor the main course, I got the Homemade tofu with scallops and lobster sauce.  There were no scallops, but there was a good amount of shrimp.  The tofu was absolutely sensational!!  \u000a\u000aI decided to give the Malaysian iced coffee a try and it was good.  Not something I'd get every time, but it certainly was worth a try.\u000a\u000aI'm glad I stopped here.  I have enough leftovers for dinner tonight.  The portions are so large, there is enough for two to share if you want.  Service was excellent.  And note, this is another Chinatown restaurant that does CASH ONLY.

VI stopped in today to get a scone after reading the reviews on Yelp.  They only had the chocolate chip scones left, but it was worth the stop.  Priced at $2.25, they are not over-priced for the size.  It was quite tasty.\u000a\u000aI'll be stopping in from time to time to see what else they had.  The woman who waited on me was just delightful!

VI've been wanting to return here for a long time but I never seem to go to the Fremont Street area for dinner.  Last night, we had a play at Las Vegas Little Theatre and I had some comp dollars from Binion's, so we finally made it here.  I hadn't been in the restaurant since it was known as Top of the Mint many years ago.\u000a\u000aAs others have said, it's a classic steakhouse and you have a great view.  We were there early and enjoyed our time looking out the window and picking out things we didn't know were around the area.\u000a\u000aFor the meal, we each started with onion soup.  It was good with a hearty beef broth and tasty cheese.  I ordered the 10 ounce NY steak and my wife ordered the 8 ounce filet.  It came with choice of starch--we each chose the garlic mashed potatoes--and seasonal vegetable which last night was yellow and green squash.  Both steaks were tasty.  Mine was done a bit to much.  It should have been rarer but it wasn't egregious enough to send it back.  \u000a\u000aFor dessert, we took a look at the dessert tray brought by our waiter, Jeff, and we opted for the same dessert, a chocolate volcano--a small bundt cake made of chocolate and filled with heated chocolate.  It was very good.\u000a\u000aA couple of things to note.  Service was very good.  Jeff has been at the steakhouse for a number of years and he's a good server.  I never wanted for a refill of my iced tea and the bus people were there to remove dirty plates when a course was finished.  The view is as good as everyone points out.  I enjoyed being there while it was light because I could pick out more places.  We were long enough that we could see the lights of Fremont Street start to glow after sundown.\u000a\u000aFor the price, I think there are other good options for steak in Las Vegas at a comparable price.

VI needed some good food before attending 4 plays at the Las Vegas Fringe Festival at Las Vegas Little Theatre in the same area as Thai Style Noodle House.  It was a no brainer as this was a place I was going to try when I got to it.  Yesterday was that time.\u000a\u000aI got a regular iced tea and I ordered the Thai spice noodles--spice level 6.  Since I didn't know how they interpret their 1 - 10 scale, I thought I'd go lower and add additional heat if needed.  \u000a\u000aThe service was very good.  In about 5 minutes, I had my plate of pan fried noodles made with vegetables and chicken.  Their 6 is more equivalent to 8 at other places so I chose wisely.  My server brought me the 4 jars common to Thai places in case in needed to spice it up a bit.\u000a\u000aThe noodles were very good.  It was a filling meal.  For less than $10, I had dinner and my iced tea.  The place was quiet on this Saturday afternoon.  There was one larger family group and two women at another table.

VThis is a solid steakhouse with a menu that has a large variety of choices--something for almost everyone. I had a reservation for 6:15 and I was greeted on arrival by two very pleasant ladies.  One of them showed me to my table and it was the first encounter with the friendly and attentive staff that work here.\u000a\u000aI studied the menu online before I went and I had narrowed my decision to two choices, the Japanese Kobe wagyu A-5 filet or the wild game tasting of three game foods.  The waiter went through some special items that weren't on the menu and he threw a curve ball at me by telling me they had a bison tasting menu with 3 preparations of bison.  I knew they were having bison during July, and this sounded really good.  After some discussion with the server, I opted to order the Kobe filet as I have not tried real Japanese waygu before. \u000a\u000aFor starters, I ordered the soup tasting trio and got the lobster bisque, the heirloom tomato, and wild mushroom flavors.  The soup comes in a container with three small wells for the soups.  It gives you a chance to taste three of their four soups.  The lobster bisque was good and even this small portion had some lobster pieces in it.  The tomato was absolutely the best.  Very flavorful.  The weakest of the three was the wild mushroom soup.  I thought it was a bit thin and didn't have a strong mushroom flavor.  The runner ground some fresh pepper into each.  One small nit here was the soups sit on another flat plate.  Since the fit is not quite exact, the soup moved around some and on delivery, some of the tomato had mixed into the other too.  Points off for this on Chopped, I'm sure.\u000a\u000aThen came the filet.  With it were 4 pearl onions.  I ordered a side of fries to accompany the steak.  They bring you a small dish with house made ketchup and mustard.  A note on the fries.  Some of the Yelp reviews state they're not crisp fries and they're correct.  The fries have a less than crispy texture and they are oily and pre-salted, just exactly what I like.  I didn't mind the lack of crispness nor the oil.  It's just the way they prepare them so if you don't like fries cooked that way, don't order them.  I very, very rarely use ketchup yet I was drawn to try the mustard and ketchup.  The mustard was OK, but the ketchup was actually better than I expected.  It was sweet, from some small raisins in the mixture.  I didn't dip many fries in it--just enough to try it out a few times--but I was intrigued by how they changed the flavor from the standard bottled kind.\u000a\u000aThe filet was very tasty and tender.  I had asked for it extra rare, and when my server suggested "blue" I responded affirmatively.  It was done a bit more than I like but it was OK.  The only thing here was that on one side of the filet, there was a section that was very sinewy and I was unable to cut it with my knife.  I tore it with the knife and fork into a couple of shreds.  I thought it odd that a cut of Kobe would not have had this trimmed or would even be like this.  Since I expected the steak to be above and beyond anything I'd ever tasted, I began to wonder if in fact I had been served A-5 wagyu but being a neophyte, there was no way I could accurately tell.  Suffice it to say that when I finished the steak, even thought it was very good, I was thinking I should have ordered the bison.  \u000a\u000aFor dessert, I got the bananas Foster bread pudding.  Very tasty and very filling. It was a good ending to the meal.\u000a\u000aService was excellent.  I had Team 1.  I believe one was Raul but I cannot remember the other's name.  My iced tea was refilled regularly, one of the two checked on me throughout the meal, and two other people from the restaurant stopped by to see how everything was.  It was top notch service.\u000a\u000aI'm sure I'll be back to Tender to try some of their game meat.  It's a fine restaurant.

VI went in July to see the Auto Collection.  I'm not a big fan of cars, but I decided the free coupon was a reason to go and see what everyone had talked about.\u000a\u000aThis is a huge and great display of vintage cars and other memorabilia, especially the old jukeboxes that were for sale.  Many of the cars are for sale, too, but some are display only.  And, the place is huge with so many cars!\u000a\u000aThe Johnny Carson car was the one I wanted to see and it brought back a lot of memories of my youth.  There's a lot here for an entire family to enjoy.\u000a\u000aWith this coupon, good until the end of the year, you get one free admission.  Print as many as are in your party.  Few people paid the day I went.\u000a\u000ahttp://autocollections.com/index.cfm?action=free&tab=free

V8 of us stopped for lunch after hiking today.  Most of us ordered the #12, pho with beef brisket.  An error was made when one of the group wanted porridge but was served #23 (vegetarian spring roll over noodles) by error.  It was removed from the bill but he kept the dish and liked it very much.\u000a\u000aThe only complaint I had with the brisket was it was uneven.  There were several flat slices of brisket, but here were also some hard pieces of beef that were tough.  \u000a\u000aI had their Vietnamese coffee.  It was good, but I've had better elsewhere.  I do like the open nature of the room and the modern decor.  Service was very good, except for the slip up noted.  \u000a\u000aWe enjoyed ourselves very much.

VI have visited the bronze a few times when I've been at the Riviera.  To me, it screams, "Las Vegas!"  What better way to celebrate the adult entertainment past and present of Las Vegas than to cast the women and have the casts made into a bronze displaying their rears at the front of the hotel.\u000a\u000aI like the whimsical nature of the bronze and I just have to smile when I see those bronze buns.  I rubbed them once but not for luck.  Just for the laughs!\u000a\u000aGo see it!

VThis was a very good dinner from beginning to end with outstanding food and service!  I made a reservation on OpenTable and in the comments I requested seating in the Swan Court.  When I arrived, there was a large group near that area.  I was seated in the main dining room with a wonderful view of the wine tower.\u000a\u000aShortly after being seated, the assistant general manager came over and apologized for the inability to seat me in the Swan Court as they were having several groups that evening.  I asked him about getting some photos of the outside, and he took me then while there was still some good daylight.  He unlocked the door and we went to the patio and I got some shots.  On the way back to the table, he gave me his business card for future reservations or help, and he had a liter bottle of S. Pellegrino brought to my table.  \u000a\u000aOn to the food.  I got the Parallel Tasting menu.  I'm going to use the descriptions from the menu because I could not have typed them all into my iPhone without being there for hours.\u000a\u000aCourse One was called the tomato course.  One plate had Textures of Tomato, light seared langoustine, and Ajo Blanco.  The parallel plate had Tesroa Tomato Confit, basil pearls, and aged balsamic brittle.\u000a\u000aCourse Two was the corn course.  One plate had summer corn Agnolotti, velouté, orels and fava beans, and popcorn shoots.  The parallel plate had Ruby Red Corn culantro, a Diver scallop, and Guanciale. \u000a\u000aCourse Three was the veal course.  One plate had veal tenderloin, Australian winter truffles, porcini lasagna, and truffle vinaigrette. The parallel plate had veal sweet breads, curried cauliflower and champagne grape slices, and Budha hand citrus.\u000a\u000aCourse Four was the coconut course.  One plate had coconut scented cheesecake, Malibu rum caramel, and Lychee sorbet.  The parallel plate had coconut rice pudding, mango sorbet, and fennel crisp.  With the coconut course, I was brought a small plate with four petit fours or mignardises.  When I polished all of that off, my server brought me 3 hand made chocolate truffles.  \u000a\u000aThe food was great!  I really enjoyed the idea of the parallel plates with two takes on a given food.  Corn two ways, coconut a couple of ways, tomato, and of course the wonderful veal.\u000a\u000aService was exemplary.  My server, Russell, was always nearby for anything I needed without hovering.  We found out that we live not too far from each other and I showed him on Yelp the new location he can buy Bon Breads in our neighborhood.  Yea, Yelp!  The numerous bus people were all quite efficient at clearing dishes, refilling my water glass, or whatever was needed.  The staff passed my twisted artificial sweetener pack test with flying colors.  It was removed in about 8 seconds.\u000a\u000aI really like the layout of the restaurant and if I couldn't sit in the Swan Court, I was glad to be where I was.  I am fascinated by that wine tower and I watched one of the wine angels ascend several times to get wine for a table.  This was a memorable dining experience and I will be back.  Hold the swans--I'll be there.\u000a\u000aEdit:  I have to add that the staff let me "play" with one of their iPads from which you can order wines or cocktails.  I sent myself an email from the iPad describing the cocktail I didn't have but I just tried it out.  It's a neat way of remembering the wine you had without having to use your memory if you email yourself.  Too bad it's a dedicated iPad.  I think I could have hidden it under my jacket.  ;-)

VI was to Trevi in January for a Yelp Elite event and I was sure I'd come back and try the menu.  I just didn't think I'd take this long.  Before our show at the Colosseum last night, we came here.\u000a\u000aWe were asked if we wanted to eat on the patio or inside.  Because the water flow at the fountain is loud, we asked for a patio seat near the back.  That's exactly what we got from the delightful hostess.\u000a\u000aWithin moments, our server was there to take our drink order and a runner stopped with fresh bread and a bottle of olive oil with a sprig of rosemary.  She poured some of the oil into a small dish for dipping the bread.  Our iced teas were quickly brought.  We had a few questions and our server, Cheyanne, was an excellent help.\u000a\u000aMy wife ordered the chicken Limone which the menu describes as "fettuccine with grilled chicken, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes and lemon zest tossed in a tangy cream sauce."  I got the pollo la Griglia which is described as "grilled chicken medallions with oven-roasted tomatoes, artichoke hearts and provolone cheese in a tomato caper bianco sauce, served with risotto cake and asparagus."  For dessert, we shared a Coppa Cioccolata which is described as "chocolate gelato and fresh raspberries with chocolate & raspberry sauces."\u000a\u000aThe food was excellent.  The cream sauce with my wife's chicken was very good, and she loved the touch of the sun-dried tomatoes in the sauce.  The chicken was moist and tender.  My chicken was also very good.  The provolone was quite stringy and made the dish very tasty!  The risotto cakes were something new for me and I'm so glad I got them.  I think I'll return and just get some risotto cakes they were that good.\u000a\u000aDessert was also excellent!  The gelato was dark chocolate and had a very rich flavor.  The fresh raspberries and the sauces just added to a good dessert and a perfect size for sharing.\u000a\u000aThe ambiance was outstanding!  Watching the ceiling lights change brightness and color to emulate sunrises and sunsets and seeing the small blue lights for stars while listening to the water at the fountain makes for a romantic and scenic setting.  It's so much fun to dine at a place like this in Las Vegas where we can watch the tourists as they stroll by and take photos of everything.  What a city!\u000a\u000aAs for service, it was first rate!  Our table was never unattended by someone.  When I put and empty packet of Sweet 'n Low on the table, it was removed almost immediately.  Cheyanne or one of the bussers kept our iced teas refilled.  She was a very pleasant young woman.  She boxed some leftovers and included a packet with plastic ware and a napkin.  \u000a\u000aI had promised Brandon, the general manager, at our Yelp event that I'd be back.  When I asked about him last night, Cheyanne gave him my message and he came to the table and chatted with us.  I also watched as he went to other tables to check on diners.  He's alert to what's going on and he's a very personable guy.  The staff and the food make this place a will return.  I am a big fan!!

VI have seen Manilow at Paris two times now, and I really enjoy the show.  This new show, compared to the one at the Las Vegas Hilton, is a much better show.  Much of the music is the same.  He sings his standards and usually throws in one or two different numbers with different show incarnations.\u000a\u000aWhat I like about the Paris show is the production.  There are several high definition screens that display works of art, pictures of New York City, and some psychedelic-like art at the end of the show.  The panels add a beauty and class to the show that raises it above what it was at the Hilton. \u000a\u000aThe 9 piece band and 4 back up singers are all very good, and the show moves along with a good pace.\u000a\u000aThe 3 friends of mine and I really enjoyed tonight's show.  I recommend it highly.\u000a\u000aPhotos are allowed during the show which is different from most shows.

VI rode my bike through this park today following the Bonanza Trail to the Angel Park Trail.  I have been in the park one other time, to attend a pro tennis match in the main court at the Darling Tennis Center on the west end of the park.\u000a\u000aThe park has 11 soccer fields and there were several games going on when I rode by.  I could see several tennis players in the side courts and you could hear the balls being whacked.\u000a\u000aThere are plenty of picnic shelters and children's play area on the north side of the park.\u000a\u000aThis is a really pleasant place to ride through if that's what you like doing.  I can see that it would be a great place for a family outing.

VFor years as a tourist and local, I've looked at the oyster bars at Coast properties and thought, "I have to try that sometime."  Last night sometime arrived.\u000a\u000aI got the crab pan roast.  It was nicely done with crab claw meat, carrots, peas, and bell pepper in a thick sauce.  I was surprised by the amount of rice in the bowl over which the crab was placed.  I experienced one piece of shell, but that was minor.  The roast was tasty.  Service was quick--I sat at the bar next to another local with whom I chatted.  She eats there regularly and the time quickly passed and I was digging into my large bowl of goodness.  I ordered iced tea and I was brought a refill without asking.  \u000a\u000aI was expecting the roast to have some kind of kick, but then, that's why they have Cholula, Tapatio, and Tabasco along the bar.  Spice it up to your heart's content - or not!\u000a\u000aI enjoyed the dinner here and it was filling!

VI am a big Beatles fan and I'm a fan of Love.  The show is very well done.  This music is exceptional.  The remastering of the music adds so much.\u000a\u000aI first saw this show in previews and there were changes made in the first months following the opening to tailor the show to fix some of the negatively received bits.  I think they've done that very well.  The one part that I thought was hysterical was not received well by early audiences.  I guess you had to have a sick sense of humor.\u000a\u000aThe acrobatics and dance movements of the crew is amazing!  I love the car, the telephone booths, and so many moments that I can't name them all.\u000a\u000aIn all, I've seen the show three times, and I have been enthralled each time.  There isn't much interaction with the audience before hand.  It seemed like that reached its height with Mystère and "O" and has been slowly left out of newer Cirque productions.\u000a\u000aIf you are a fan of good music and excellent acrobatics and dance, go see Love.  You won't be disappointed!

VI have now seen George Wallace's show 3 times.  Many of the jokes and routines are the same.  Much changes from night to night based on his banter with the audience.\u000a\u000aHe always asks where people are from and makes a comment about being there the day before.  It gets a lot of laughs after people realize what he's up to.\u000a\u000aThe jokes about people saying stupid things are reruns but they are always very funny.  I especially like his convenience store jokes.  They are so true.\u000a\u000aThere was something new last night.  He asked if there were any preachers in the audience.  Two people identified themselves as being clergy and they were asked to come to the foot of the stage.  Go see the show to see what happened.  Lesson to potential show goers -- never volunteer information unless you want to become part of the show.  \u000a\u000aThis is a very decent show and very entertaining.  Wallace has a lot of energy.  The show started at about 10:05 and he went to 11:40 without stopping.  You certainly get your money's worth.

VI saw Louie for the 4th time last night and I really like his shows.  I've seen Louie: LOL, Louie: Larger Than Life, and now his Big Baby Boomer.  Over the last couple of years, Louie has changed his show and he has become a bit quieter.\u000a\u000aThe showroom has removed a number of seats, so most of the seating is in the center only as opposed to being in three areas plus the booths.  Attendance last night was not good.  With an audience like that, Louie tried with his jokes.  Some went over well while others didn't.  He then started working some of the audience and he did this expertly.  He also commented along the lines of when your jokes are failing, you might as well do this.  It was great fun with mild kidding with the couple of audience members.\u000a\u000aLouie has a very pleasant demeanor and he is quite a funny man in his low key way.  He's not a yeller nor screamer like some comics.  He gets the job done with low key humor.  The ending last night was a favorite facial gesture he gets to remember the one time his mother swore.  I think I'll use it from now on.

VI had dinner here on 11 December 2009.  I had the Boiled Beef with Szechuan Sauce.  It was wonderful.  Finally, a Chinese restaurant that knows how to do hot/spicy food.\u000a\u000aI read previous reviews and I recommend doing what others have done--ladle some of the beef onto your rice, eat, and repeat.  When finished, you'll have a nice bowl of spicy "rice soup" that is a super way to finish a meal.\u000a\u000aService was good.  The young servers seemed surprised that a caucasian would like the spicy food so much.  I will return and try some of their other, more exotic dishes.\u000a\u000aThanks to fellow Yelpers for giving me a reason to stop here before going next door to see a play at the Las Vegas Little Theatre,

VReview for restaurant only:\u000a\u000aIn my quest to try different spots for breakfast, I've started hitting local golf clubs that are open to the public.  Bear's Best is only about 2 miles from where I live, so this was a no brainer for breakfast before going to the Great Las Vegas Santa Run 2011.\u000a\u000aI'd give this restaurant 3 stars, but a few things tipped the balance to 4.  The menu is small--5 items.  I ordered the breakfast burrito, a nice sized burrito with scrambled eggs, ham, peppers, and home fries.  It was served with fire roasted salsa that was tasty but mild.  They did have tabasco on the table, but that's not for me for a burrito.\u000a\u000aThe food was very hot, the service was very, very prompt, and the server was just a delight.  She had a pleasant attitude. I chuckled with her when the guy before me walked away with his coffee with shot of Bailey's Irish Cream and brandy.  The wind and cold wasn't going to bother this guy!\u000a\u000aI'll come back for lunch sometime when it's warm and I can enjoy the food and the view of Blue Diamond Hill from the patio.  Damn, I just wish they'd let me ride the cart path on my bike.  It's not too big of a thing to ask!  :-)

VI shop at a different Albertsons generally, but I do stop here often for the Starbuck's outlet.  This is also my Sunday  distance spot for riding my bike, and I stop for my Starbucks and to buy the LA TImes.  I enjoy the coffee on the large patio area, and then I ride home with the Times hanging from the handle bars.  \u000a\u000aIt wouldn't be Sunday without this stop!

VOn the recommendation of a friend, I stopped yesterday and bought two prime filets and two 1855 black angus NY Strip steaks.  I grilled one of each last night and they steaks were excellent.  I also bought two links of spinach and cheese chicken sausage.  They'll be on the grill tonight.\u000a\u000aThe woman staffing the tore was very pleasant. I like that I can get the kind of steak cut the way I want.  I took the time to check out some of their more exotic meats in the freezer and I'll be getting some elk steaks in the future.\u000a\u000aI'm glad I took the time to stop here and check it out.  It is so worth it!

VI have seen Gordie Brown more times than any other entertainer in Las Vegas and I really enjoy his show.  I first saw him in 2004 and through the years have gone to see the changes in impersonations.\u000a\u000aHe has changed his act some and he is depending less on George Bush and Bill Clinton for laughs but they're still in his act.  And, I'm sure they'll still be drawing laughs in the years to come.\u000a\u000aBrown has updated some of his material including an attempt to do some rap to appeal to a younger crowd.  The problem is, a younger crowd is generally not buying tickets for his show.   The show hits very much those of middle age and older (you define middle age--I won't.)  If you read the reviews on Yelp, people will often rate the show good or bad depending on their age.  That's not a bad thing--it's merely what people like.\u000a\u000aI'm sure I'll be heading back to see Gordie in another two years.  It was almost exactly two years since I saw him before last night and I enjoyed myself.  And, I still laughed at k-nock, k-nock!  If you don't understand that, go see his show!

VI had a gift card for Koi so I decided to use part of it last night for dinner before going to see Peepshow.\u000a\u000aFor starters, I ordered the seafood miso soup.  The menu says clams, shrimp, and bay scallops.  There was one clam which was very good.  The shrimp was fine and the bay scallops were good, too.\u000a\u000aFor the main course, I got the sesame encrusted lobster tail.  The plating was artfully done.  The lobster was OK.  I had two issues.  One, encrusted means one thing to me and another to Koi.  I imagined more sesame but there was merely a sprinkling.  Second, the lobster tail didn't have a very distinctive lobster flavor.  It was rather bland.  The kitchen helps you out by cutting under the meat and along the sides and then across the meat.  You're able to eat it easily without having the whole tail removed from its shell.  With the lobster, you get baby bok choy.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I chose the flourless molten chocolate cake.  It comes with some berries and vanilla ice cream with butterscotch sauce.  This was excellent!\u000a\u000aService was very good.  My iced tea glass was replaced with a fresh one as I neared the end of each one--no need to ask for a refill.  \u000a\u000aThis place just lacked the 4 star experience I'd hoped for.  It was the food, not the service that brings me to rate it as OK.  I still have money on the gift card, so I'll be back to try something else in the future.

VI had the $19 prix fixe lunch today (5/14/10).  It was excellent!  I started with the onion tart and salad.  Main course was the couscous.  For dessert, I had the George V, a dark chocolate pastry filled with vanilla and chocolate mousse, topped with peanuts and over a black sacher biscuit.  It was delightful.  \u000a\u000aYou can't go wrong with this lunch.  I really liked the small restaurant.

V3.5 stars\u000a\u000aI really thought this dinner would be special but it wasn't.  I was the first person in the restaurant at 5:30.  I was seated by a bus person at a corner table where I was content to be.  The waiter with the French accent suggested I might want a better spot, but I was happy where I was.  The restaurant is made up of small rooms with intimate seating and low lighting.  It would be a romantic place to go.\u000a\u000aI had a Groupon for $50 so I ordered off the à la carte menu.  I was brought  some slices of wonderful baguette with a small dish of butter.  Then came a basket, very large, of crudités.  Finally, a small plate with olives-both green and ripe.  The dijon dipping sauce for the vegetables was very tasty.  I only had a few pieces of zucchini so as not to eat too much before the meal.\u000a\u000aThe homemade terrine de foie gras was a bit of a disappointment.  I guess I was comparing to other foie gras I've eaten and this came up short.  I did like the presentation with the toast points, the separated dish with salt and pepper, the greens with some dressing, and the small amount of cranberry relish on the plate.\u000a\u000aNext came the filet au poivre.  It was a bit too done for me.  I asked for it rare and it was somewhat rare, but I should have ordered it black and blue.  That was my error, not theirs.  The cracked pepper was great and the peppercorn sauce was excellent!  The pommes frites were a bit hard although they weren't over-browned.  There was a small broiled tomato slice with the steak.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I pre-ordered the chocolate lava cake with the homemade vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.  I took the waiter's suggestion because I was torn between that and the Grand Marnier soufflé.  The dessert was fantastic.  The waiter broke the top of the cake like one would a soufflé.  Some of the molten chocolate came out and lathered the sides of the cake.  He then added a scoop of the ice cream and topped it with the whipped cream.\u000a\u000aSummary:  Although I was the first person there, it didn't seem like they were ready even though they opened a half hour before.  The bus person had to brew the iced tea which took awhile.  Since so many diners have wine, maybe this isn't a priority for them.  The bus person didn't bring sugar or artificial sweetener even though he asked me once if I wanted and I said yes.  10 minutes later, he realized he had forgotten and he asked me again.  It wasn't that busy.  \u000a\u000aWhile the food was good, i expected so much more for the hype about this place.  I'm glad I tried it, but I'm not sure I'd return.

VI stopped here tonight with a neighbor for dinner after seeing her husband at rehab.  We each had a Chicken Club Wrap.  I had mine with fries and Geri had hers with a salad.  They allow substitutes for the fries.  If you get fries, they have "endless fries."  You can keep getting another portion by asking.  Since the wrap and the fries I did get were sufficient, I didn't ask for more.  Our server did ask if I wanted more fries.\u000a\u000aService was prompt, the ambience was OK, and I enjoyed this first visit to Islands.  It's simply one more option for a quick meal in the Summerlin area.

VI think this was probably the longest 65 minutes I've spent any any show.  Bite has moved to the Plaza and I had a free ticket last night so why not?  Well the long 65 minutes would be why not.\u000a\u000aThe show has been around for many years at the Stratosphere before moving to the Plaza so it's not jumping on the vampire movie craze that seems to have gripped the younger people.  \u000a\u000aI think the biggest problem is there really is no cohesive story and the show's writers don't know what kind of show they want other than topless (sometimes) female vampires doing different dances in different costumes in different amounts of dress/undress.  There are a couple of small magic tricks done by one of the male vampires and there were some strong man lifts and balances à la Mystère and the guys were OK.  But these disjointed segments of magic, dancing, strong man routines point out the unfocused nature of the show.  The showroom at the Plaza, which I think is a great classing Las Vegas room, is not designed for the types of things they used to do at the Strat.  There used to be some acrobatics done with silks, but that has to be dropped in this showroom.\u000a\u000aThe music was something else.  There was some 80s rock music and mixed in were two selections from opera that had almost no reason for being where they were.  Most of the music is recorded, but some was live and the singer was not too bad.\u000a\u000aAn acquaintance was seated at the same table as I was and his reaction was much the same as mine.  OK, I don't need to see this one again.  How this show continues to survive is completely beyond me.  The applause last night was not too great.  I have a feeling the show will soon bite the dust.

VI went to see the show last night (1/10/10).  I have seen 3 other hypnotist shows, and I was leery about seeing another one, but I managed to score a comp.  Why not go? \u000a\u000aThe show was very, very funny and very entertaining!  I laughed and laughed--more than I do at most comedy club shows around Las Vegas.\u000a\u000aI have always thought some of the people were acting at hypnosis shows.  I can't say that about Cools.  No one could act that well!  It is a see once type of show.  I agree with robert m. that the all floor seating is a problem.  I was glad I had an almost direct view to the stage.  I was seated in the next to last row, but hey, the price was right!!

VThis is the second time we saw Vinnie Favorito.  He is exceedingly funny.  He's an equal opportunity insulter and he says what under normal circumstances would be simply outrageous and unacceptable.  \u000a\u000aHe picks on all races and ethnic backgrounds during his hour of asking questions and then making comments.  If you are squeamish about a lack of political correctness, this is not the show for you.  If you like a hearty laugh along with the people he's talking to in the audience, this is the show for you.\u000a\u000aI am sure that there's a pattern during every show - find a Mexican, a black, a gray hair, and an Asian.  Then go to work with them after finding out their names and what they do.  He's so very quick with his quips.  His mind must race all show long.\u000a\u000aIf you want a good laugh while in Las Vegas, go see Vinnie Favorito at the Flamingo.  You won't regret it.

VI tried Oyshi on 7/6/09 on the recommendation of a friend. Everything was great! I found my server to be very friendly. She was truly a delight and she was very helpful! I had the Hot Tamale, Love Affair, and Crazy Philly rolls. All were superb especially the Love Affair. While I had more, I won't bore with a complete list.\u000a\u000aI will come back for the all you can eat again. It was every bit as good as I was told when the place was recommended.

VI had a free ticket for a movie at the South Point so I went to see Super 8 today in their XD theatre.  It was great.  The screen is very large, IMAX-like, with superb sound!  \u000a\u000aBefore the show started, a man came through checking to see that everything was clean and in order, and he had a checklist he followed as he did his theatre checking.\u000a\u000aWhen the show was over, two workers were waiting to come in and clean the theatre.I was very  impressed with the whole operation.\u000a\u000aSeating was comfortable but the leg room was a little less than I had expected.  Also, the seats are of a vinyl quality which made them a little difficult on the legs because I was wearing shorts.\u000a\u000aSince it was a Tuesday, and the show has been out for awhile, there were all of 11 people in this very large theatre.  If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd go here more often.

VBúzios has been on my to try list for quite some time.  When I saw a Groupon for it, I bought one and planned to have dinner here on the night I was going to see Penn & Teller at the Rio.\u000a\u000aI had a reservation for 6:30 and I was promptly seated in an almost empty restaurant.  There was one table occupied and one person eating at the seafood bar.  I had looked at the menu online, but I took some time looking there, changing my mind, and then ordering.  I was brought a bread basket, served water, and brought an iced tea quickly.\u000a\u000aI ordered a jumbo lump crabmeat cocktail, the miso Chilean sea bass, and the 7 layer chocolate cake for dessert.  The lump crabmeat was the best part of the meal.  The crab was tasty and the cocktail sauce they brought had extra horseradish to mix in.  I really enjoyed this appetizer.\u000a\u000aThe sea bass was disappointing.  It was on the menu under their "House Signatures" section of the menu.  It's described as sea bass with a house made miso glaze.  What I got was more of a miso gravy than glaze and it wasn't appealing.  When I tasted it, I wished I had ordered the plain sea bass.  The sea bass was moist and very hot (temperature).  The entrée comes with two sides and I chose cole slaw and garlic fries.  The fires were good but they had absolutely no taste of garlic.  The cole slaw was OK.\u000a\u000aWhen it came to dessert, I had asked my server if the cobbler was warmed.  He said yes.  I asked him if it was already warm and he said no.  I ordered the cobbler and asked that it not be warmed.  About 3 minutes later, he came back and said they ran out of cobbler.  I opted for the 7 layer chocolate cake.  I wonder if they really were out or if the cobbler was indeed kept warm and he didn't want to tell me that.\u000a\u000aService was spotty during the night.  Empty Sweet 'n Low packets were not removed from the table until I put them in the empty crab cocktail glass.  Iced tea wasn't refilled as quickly as many restaurants of lesser cost, and the table was not properly bussed.  The waiter didn't remove the bread basket and bread plate before he brought the dessert.  After I had taken a few bites of the cake, a bus person came by and removed those items.\u000a\u000aAnd then there's the Groupon.  The fine print says not valid with any other..... including Total Rewards.  That means, they don't give you the TR pricing.  It's not that much of a loss to the customer and it shouldn't be that big of a deal for Búzios either.  $1 more for the appetizer, $3 more for the sea bass, and $1 more for dessert.  You got $5 more out of me for using a Groupon.  Was it worth it to you?  Also, the Groupon states that an 18% service fee (note they can't say gratuity anymore because of IRS rules) will be applied to the bill prior to discount.  I somewhat understand this, but my server got cheated a bit because I normally do 20%.  Not that much difference but hey, I'm getting back part of the TR pricing I couldn't have.  \u000a\u000aFinally, reservations were made through Open Table.  At any other restaurant, as soon as I check in, Open Table says I have 100 points.  As of this afternoon, my Open Table points are "pending".\u000a\u000aThis apparently is the way Búzios operates.  Don't be business friendly with the customer.  Instead, challenge them and nickel and dime them every step of the way.  Groupons normally are sold by new companies to drive traffic and make a name.  The other reason is to help failing places.  Since the Búzios Groupon is an ongoing seller, I can only imagine that they're struggling to stay alive.\u000a\u000aWhat a mistake it was to come here!

The selection was good, the store wasn't jam packed with shoppers, and check out was not a bring a cot and nap while you wait.\u000a\u000aI'll return given the pain free shopping I had yesterday!

VOne of the great things about living in Las Vegas is just dropping in at the Bellagio Conservatory to see the plantings and display.  It doesn't matter if I've seen this one already.  It's always worth a stop, especially in the morning when some of the tourists are still fighting their hangovers and don't want to leave their rooms.\u000a\u000aThis year, the summer show was scrapped from the lineup.  Instead, the spring show morphed into the summer display with a change out of the type of flowers in the display.  It's still quite lovely.\u000a\u000aIt's quite interesting to time a visit when they are doing the changeover from one season to the next.  You see the "shell" of the Conservatory and how they place the displays so they make up the finished product.\u000a\u000aAfter the Conservatory, it's always time for some gelato either from Jean Philippe or Cafe Gelato.  Enjoy this while you people watch.  Tourists can be so interesting and funny!

VI had a myVegas comp for the buffet and used it last night.  I was surprised by the get your own drinks, but that's OK with me.  I didn't have to wait for anyone other than myself.\u000a\u000aI started by doing a walk through of the entire area to see what they had.  I ended up starting with salads.  I had macaroni salad-pretty standard and OK.  The western salad was shredded lettuce with red bell pepper and fresh jalapeño rounds.  This salad had a nice kick and was quite good.  I also had some couscous which also was good.  I did find some bread sticks by the salad station.  In the regular roll area, they had standard large rolls.  They were out of butter packets so only small margarine containers were available.  The breadstick didn't need it.\u000a\u000aI then went to the carving area and he had a new piece of beef.  This is not prime rib.  It looked like it was a rectangle of beef and it looked well done.  When I asked the gentleman where had all the nice rare meat gone that had been there when I did my walk through, he cut the beef in half and gave me a nice slice from the less done inside.  I got a piece of bok choy, some hush puppies, and a macadamia crusted chicken breast with apricot.  There was no  macadamia nut flavor at all.  The apricot gave the chicken some taste rather than being plain chicken.\u000a\u000aI then went to the desserts.  They had a fairly nice selection of the small plastic cups that are appearing in buffets everywhere.  My first plate had a panna cotta with a lemon top filling with a fresh raspberry, flan with a fresh blackberry and some chopped nuts, and a small container of chocolate trifle.  The panna cotta and the chocolate trifle were great--the flan less so.\u000a\u000aSecond dessert plate had a macadamia nut cookie, a small pastry filled with vanilla cream and another fresh raspberry, and the star of the desserts, an Oreo cookie cheesecake.\u000a\u000aThe buffet was OK.  For the $22 they charge, you're not getting the kind of fare you'd get at the Bellagio or other property but they also charge $10 or more.  I wouldn't drive to the Strip to pay for this buffet.  We have a lot better choices in our locals casinos not on the Strip.  But for a comp, it was a nice dinner.  And I really did like the fact that I got more iced tea anytime I wanted without waiting.\u000a\u000aFinally, every time I left my table, it was bussed before I got back.  That's not something that happens at all buffets.  I saw several people leaving last night without leaving even a dollar for the bus person.  I know I did most of the work, but he cleaned my table before, during, and after my dinner there last night.  He and the other wait staff deserve a tip!

VI really like Town Square.  I'm normally there to visit the Apple Store or for some kind of event like today's Santa Run to benefit Opportunity Village. \u000a\u000aIt's fun to sit and watch people strolling and kids playing in the park area.  \u000a\u000aParking is quite easy in the garages or you can surface park in one of the lots.  The food offerings are excellent and the Rave Theatres in the back are quite nice.\u000a\u000aI guess I like Town Square because it's a nostalgic look back at what shopping used to be like before strip malls--when towns actually had squares and there were small stores along the streets.  Town Square does a nice job in trying to recreate that atmosphere.

VI stopped for breakfast today on a bike ride from Lake Mead Parkway.  I thought riding the 7.5 miles to get here would be a nice place to stop, have some coffee, and a bit of breakfast.\u000a\u000aGetting seated was terribly slow.  There was one older person to seat and take payment at the register so things were slow.  By the time I was seated, the line behind me was about 5 couples deep.  I had to wait even though I sat at the counter.\u000a\u000aThat being said, my server was prompt with the coffee and he took my order quickly, too.  I had a cheese and mushroom omelette, hash browns, and toast.  $8 + with tax.  \u000a\u000aThis is a fine place for breakfast, and I'd stop here again.

VI really like the Springs Preserve.  This review would have been 5 stars if the Preserve still had the "Untold Stories" series on the first Thursday of the month.  These programs about the history of Las Vegas were wonderful, but the Preserve decided to re-evaluate their educational offerings.\u000a\u000aI love the Origen Building with its movie "Miracle in the Mojave" about water and the lack thereof in the Las Vegas Valley.  It's a brief film, narrated by Martin Sheen, and it quite nicely relates how the area came to be what it is geologically.\u000a\u000aThe flash flood in the Origen is also fun to see.  When it's not too hot, I like to go in the back and see the animals in the fenced area or in the display domes.\u000a\u000aI need to go back and hike the trails again to see what has changed from when they opened.

VI periodically stop at Einstein Brothers to buy bagels.  I really like salt bagels but they don't make these.  They just have pretzel bagels with some salt on them.  I stopped to get 1/2 dozen bagels so I could have something different for breakfast.\u000a\u000aThe bagels are good, but I think they're more expensive that some other places.  Service here was prompt and friendly.

VI started a new December tradition this year--having breakfast on Christmas Day and New Year's Day somewhere on the Las Vegas Strip preferably with a patio and hopefully no wind.\u000a\u000aI've been going to try Morels during Restaurant Week but never got to it.  I called last week to check that the patio was open for breakfast and that it was heated.  The woman I spoke to said, "Oh yes!  It's very nice."\u000a\u000aI was there close to opening time this morning.  When I went in, I asked the host if the patio was open.  He said, "Yes, but it's cold out."  I replied that I knew and I had dressed warmly.  I was shown to a table facing TI.  During the 45 or so minutes I was there, I had no company on the patio and the heaters were not on nor were any turned on for my benefit.\u000a\u000aHaving read the Yelp reviews and the menu online, I think I knew when I went I would be ordering the mascarpone stuffed French toast.  I also got the Kenya AA Oaklands Estate coffee that was done in a French press.  I got a glass of tomato juice and some tabasco to make my spicy breakfast drink.\u000a\u000aThe French toast was excellent.  When I ordered, my server, Carlos, asked if I wanted the syrup on the side which was my choice.  The French toast is a nice sized round of tasty bread filled with mascarpone and topped with fresh strawberries, bananas, and a few raspberries.  The cinnamon on the toast and some crunchy sugar on the berries added to the fine flavor.  The syrup was good, but I could use it sparingly the French toast was so good.\u000a\u000aCarlos brought me a second pot of coffee and I enjoyed sitting there watching the workers do some painting of the walls.  I hadn't seen any graffiti from New Year's Eve partiers, but maybe they were just cleaning up some foot prints where people jumped the wall to get to the closed Boulevard.\u000a\u000aI would have given Morels four stars but for the heaters.  When you call ahead and get a yes answer and then it's not true and no one offered to light the one right behind me, it's a service let down for me.  Carlos was a fine server and we talked about where he had parked NYE so he could get to work and back to his car with the street closures.  He gave me some tips I'll put to use next year when I do go to the Boulevard or close instead of watching on TV.

VIt's been a couple of years since we've been here and we wanted to do something different.  Dinner comes with fideo soup, rice, beans, and choice of corn or flour tortillas.\u000a\u000aMy wife had the chicken Celestina, a chicken breast with black and green olives, and almond slices cooked in garlic, lime and wine.  I had the chicken Rebeca, also a chicken breast but with cooked with fresh cactus strips, onions, cilantro, and cubed tomatoes with a bit of chopped jalapeño.  \u000a\u000aWe both enjoyed our dishes.  I was surprised that my wife liked the almond in her dish.  She's generally been averse to such additions to food.  Imagine my surprise!  I enjoyed the cactus with my chicken.  Both dishes had good flavors of fresh ingredients.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, we had their chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream.  It was more than enough for two people. The cake was a round shaped and was filled with a liquid chocolate and was much like a lava cake.  The ice cream had caramel drizzled on top.\u000a\u000aI'm not sure why we don't come here more often.  It's close to home and it's very good.  Service was excellent!

VWhen I first moved to Las Vegas, I used to avoid his place when possible because the lines were so huge.  Today, I made a quick stop to drop of some mail, and I was surprised to see that there was almost no line even though people would be in the Christmas mailing rush.\u000a\u000aSince most post offices now have self serve package weighing a buying postage, the lines have shrunk.  Still, I'd rather print postage at home and avoid the PO altogether.

V*** Review is for Spring Restaurant Week 2014 menu ***\u000a\u000aTable 10 only offers a lunch option during Restaurant Week but this is a good way to try a place.  For the first course, I went with the chicken and Andouille sausage gumbo.  This is Emeril's place so why go with a salad.  The gumbo also had steamed rice in it and my server added freshly ground pepper to my liking.  When I first tasted the gumbo, I thought that it needed something more to kick it up a notch.  I almost asked for some hot sauce but I thought that might be like asking for a salt shaker at Joël Robuchon.  As I ate the gumbo, the spiciness started to kick in.  The spice was there.  It showed itself fully as you ate more of the gumbo.\u000a\u000aFor the main course, I chose the the pea tortellini.  This menu describes it as sweet pea tortellini with handmade pasta, pea shoots, Romano cheese, mascarpone and lemon oil.  It was really a flavorful dish and just the right amount for lunch considering dessert was yet to come.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, you can choose any of the desserts on the menu.  I went with the specialty of the house, the banana cream pie.  It was excellent.  A tall slice of goodness with layers of large, whole chucks of banana with seams of cream.  It's like a block wall of banana with cream holding the blocks in place.  It was excellent!\u000a\u000aService was good.  There weren't a whole lot of people here, but it appeared like one server was covering the lunch crowd except for the people sitting at the bar.\u000a\u000aA solid Restaurant Week selection!

VI went here for dinner this evening, and I ordered the Kitfo Special - #26 on the menu.  As with Teri, the waitress asked if I wanted it well.  I said, "No," very quickly, and she said, "You want it raw?"  My answer was a definite yes!!\u000a\u000aIt was superb.  They gave me a small container of extra spice, and I used a lot of it.  It was quite good!  The meat was almost shredded, and there must have been a pound of beef.  Along with it was collard greens and homemade cottage cheese.  This really is a dish to share because you eat so much injera to consume the dish, and I wasn't coming home after, so I couldn't get a box to go.\u000a\u000a I will be back to try the lamb tibs.  This is a great find, and thanks to you who have put your reviews here before!

VWhen I need to get my diet Arizona iced tea in cans, I head to a 99 Cent Only store as they're the only ones who stock this après hike treat.  As usual, there was a large quantity available and I bought 24 cans.\u000a\u000aCheck out was fast, the price was right, and in no time I was on my way with the goodies.  I even bought a bag of salad greens and a plastic box of cherry tomatoes each for a mere 99.99 cents, a savings over any store.\u000a\u000aWhile this isn't my grocery of choice, it's the special thing I can't get elsewhere that brings me back!

VThe show is fun to watch once or twice.  I stop in to watch it about once a year or so and I find it lots of fun.  It's always as much for me to watch the tourists and listen to them than it is watching the volcano show.\u000a\u000aThe remake that opened a few years ago improved some on the show.  There is much more fire now to simulate a volcanic eruption.\u000a\u000aThis is one of those free shows every tourist needs to do when in Las Vegas.  It's a great photo op, and it's an enjoyable show!

VThis is way out of the way for me, but I happened to be killing some time and I drove down Dean Martin Drive from Twain to Blue Diamond Highway.  Since I still had time left before I needed to pick up my "fare," I stopped in here for gas.\u000a\u000aThe only problem I had wasn't their fault.  The sun was so bright I couldn't see the numbers displayed on the screen.  I ended up pulling to a pump int he shade and everything was OK from then on.

VFour of us went here for dinner tonight with a $25 restaurant.com certificate.  Two people had fajitas (one chicken, one beef), my wife had Pollo Ranchero, and I had steak Tacos al Carbon.  We also had an order of table side made guacamole.\u000a\u000aEverything was very good and we all enjoyed our respective meals very much.  The guacamole was outstanding.  Service was very good.  The staff was quick to refill drinks, and we were quite pleased with our decision to eat here prior to seeing Louie Anderson in the Bonkerz Comedy Club.

VThis was the second time I've been to an In-N-Out restaurant and I was pleased with the burger.  I got a burger, protein style and an order of fries.\u000a\u000aThe burger was very juicy, and the sauce on the burger didn't overwhelm the flavor.  The fries were good.\u000a\u000aAlmost every review mentions how busy this location is and they are all correct.  We waited about 20 minutes to place and receive our order.  The parking lot was almost full near the restaurant although there's another lot north of the main one.  The interior was jammed with people.  A friend waited in line to place our order while I walked around trying to score a table.  It was almost like playing musical chairs and I finally sat at one two seater table before someone else.\u000a\u000aSInce I don't generally buy burgers out (I like them cooked rare and most places don't do this) I have less experience with burger joints. This would have been a 4 star review but for the wait and the quickness with which we had to eat or burger to get to our show on time.

VI wasn't necessarily a cupcake fan and couldn't understand the huge increase in popularity for cupcakes, but now I know why they're the "in" thing for many people.  Yesterday on the way back from hiking with Yelp friends at Mount Charleston, we did a quick off/on the freeway to go to Retro bakery.  I've seen the reviews, but since it's a drive from where I live, I never went here.  That will change.\u000a\u000aI bought a box of four, and it was difficult picking the flavors I wanted because they all looked so good.  I ended up with; 1) red carpet with an almond butter cream frosting on a red velvet like cake; 2) Coffee and doughnut with a frosting of sugar doughnut-like frosting and a dollop of coffee flavored frosting; 3) Cookies and cream; and 4) Chocolate fountain with chocolate cake and chocolate buttercream frosting and dipped in chocolate ganache.\u000a\u000aWe tried the Coffee and doughnut and the Chocolate fountain yesterday and will polish off the other two tonight.  I think some people might think the frosting is too sweet, but I'm such a sour person, sweet is always good!\u000a\u000aI forgot to add that the staff was very friendly and quite helpful!\u000a\u000aI'll be stopping in after a hike again because I want to get some of their large cookies.  They looked so good in the case.

VI have gone to many shows at the Onyx Theatre.  As the other reviewers have said, the theatre is a small, intimate one with seating for just over 100 people.  \u000a\u000aI often sit in the front row, so I'm close to the play and sometimes I've become a part of it.  Tonight, I saw the live "Rocky Horror Show" with some very talented performers with great voices.  The four piece band was excellent accompaniment and it was a well done show.  \u000a\u000aI'll be back in a few weeks to see the musical "I Do, I Do," a real change of pace from tonight.

VThis Starbuck's would get a 4 star rating except for its location.  It's tucked away in the corner of a shopping plaza.  There is a nice sitting area along Green Valley Parkway, but I wasn't interested in sitting today.  I wanted to get my drink and be gone.\u000a\u000aThe staff was quite pleasant and efficient.

VI go to Yogel's often.  The yogurt is always tasty, and they rotate flavors often.  They have started carrying one no sugar added flavor which is nice.  Nothing is nicer than to sit on the large patio on a summer night and enjoy your yogurt while you watch planes on their way to McCarran.  I love this place!

VI wanted to try Brand after reading the good reviews on Yelp.  The food and the service was good, but it didn't make it to four stars.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Brooklyn filet, a 12 ounce, bone-in filet.  I ordered it black and blue.  I opted for the loaded baked potato as my server suggested it was more of a single diner option for a side than some of the others which are almost large enough to be shared.  The baker had butter, sour cream, cheese, and bacon.  \u000a\u000aFor dessert, I got the banana s'mores, a unique dessert of a banana with with some chocolate and toasted miniature marshmallows on top of the baked banana.  With the banana came 3 dishes, one with some extra chocolate bits, one with vanilla ice cream, and one with a sauce of peanut butter with coconut.  There were also some graham crackers to dip or just eat with the other things.\u000a\u000aThe food was good.  The filet was grilled nicely and done the way I requested.  The dessert was quite creative and something you don't see anywhere else. \u000a\u000aService was excellent.  Iced tea was refilled promptly, my server came by several times to see if I needed anything, and they passed the dead sweetener packet test with flying colors!\u000a\u000aSo why 3 stars.  One, they had no bread service.  Really?  At these prices you can't do bread.  I also am not fond of the openness of the restaurant to the casino.  When I'm at a casino steakhouse, I want to be cut off from the sights and sounds of the casino.  Here, I had a view of several flat screens at the blackjack pits and i could see lots of flashing slot lights.  Finally, there really wasn't anything special about the food.  The s'mores dessert was special but the rest was OK.  Hence the 3 stars.  It's not a place to which I'd come back.

VI have to give this library a great rating, too!  This is very close to home and has a good collection.  The library system will send any book you order from the system here.\u000a\u000aI had to get a new card tonight because it had been so long since I last used it, they dropped me from the system.  Within a matter of minutes, I was once again a user in good standing.  If I wanted to wait, I could have placed a hold on the book I needed.  Instead, I drove to the Summerlin Library and used my renewed status to check out the book without waiting.\u000a\u000aCan you imagine a retired teacher who hasn't been to the library in over 2 years?  Shhhh!  Don't tell anyone!

VOur hiking group had lunch here on 19 November 2009 to celebrate one of our member's birthday. We had 2 orders of beef rolls, one of the green onion pancakes, 2 orders of XLB, some sizzling seafood over crispy rice, Mongolian beef, crispy stir fried beef, and an order of extra spicy stir fried chicken. There were 8 of us. The birthday girl was the only one who had been there before.\u000a\u000aThe only disappointment were the green onion pancakes. They were quite bland, and I looked for salt. No luck.\u000a\u000aThey made an impromptu dessert for the group of deep fried buns with white sugar and a bit of chocolate sauce as a birthday gift for our friend. \u000a\u000aI will be back with my wife. I was very impressed with the service and the XLB. I want to try some of their other things.

VChina Mama has gone downhill since the first time I went there.  We went for dinner before theatre tonight and it was somewhat of a letdown.  The star of the meal was the xiao long bao.  The dumplings were tasty, good pork filling, and the broth inside the dumpling was very good.\u000a\u000aI got the Chicken and Assorted Vegetables with Szechuan Hot Sauce In Pot.  It was a very large bowl.  The broth was good and it was nicely spiced.  My wife ordered sesame chicken.  This wasn't that good.  The chicken consisted of small nuggets for the most part coated with a sweet cause and topped with some sesame seeds.  I tried some and the chicken was very blah.\u000a\u000aI guess this will be the last I come to China Mama.

VThis was the second time I saw Jersey Boys and enjoyed it a lot!  I went to the early show tonight because an acquaintance, Travis Cloer, does the Frankie Valli part.\u000a\u000aThe show was as fresh and alive as the first time I saw it.  I love the music, the story, and reminds me of the songs I played often when I was younger.  The show is high energy, past paced, and very well written.\u000a\u000aThere is an 8 minute break just over an hour into the show which is a nice touch for Las Vegas shows.\u000a\u000aThe graphics that fly in and out are great.  The brass players in the band are especially strong!  \u000a\u000aThis is one Las Vegas show you should put on your short list if you haven't yet seen it!

VI stopped in here this morning because I love grits.  Usually I just have grits as a side when I'm at Denny's or get a small bowl at Red Rock's buffet but this is the real thing.  I got a grits bowl.  I chose the three slices of bacon and I got cheddar cheese on the top.  I asked for the egg sunny side up.  It also came with a choice of toast or biscuit and I got whole wheat toast.  \u000a\u000aI left the counter carrying my coffee cup and within a relatively short time, a young woman brought my breakfast to me.  Wow, was it good!  Break the yolk, and let it run into the grits along with the butter I had already put in.  Wonderful.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant is small--nine tables.  There was a couple with two small children at the other table--I hit a quiet morning--and they were visiting from California.  That's the kind of homey atmosphere the place has.\u000a\u000aAdam, the young man taking orders today, was a very pleasant guy! \u000a\u000aThis is stick to your ribs down home cooking.  What that means is that breakfast was heavy laden with carbs so I'll have to do extra at my gym workout this afternoon.  Oh the horror, but it was so worth it.\u000a\u000aThanks to Sylvia and Nelson Q. for their heads up on this great place.

VThis Apple Store gets highest ratings from me.  I have been here to purchase computers and I've been here for help and or repair.  I had an issue with software on my MacBook Pro.  I tried to get help through the Apple online discussion groups, but the advice didn't solve my problem.  I made an appointment with the Genius Bar for 3:30 yesterday afternoon.\u000a\u000aI arrived at 3:27 and was promptly checked in despite the store being very busy both with shoppers and people waiting for the Genius Bar.  At 3:50, I was called to the bar, and I explained my problem with iPhoto.  The genius asked a few questions, restarted the computer, had me log back into my account, and the problem was over.  He explained what probably happened, and how I know how to remedy the situation if this happens in the future.  I left the store at 3:57 with my laptop in normal working order!\u000a\u000aI have been very impressed by the staff here.  It seems like no question phases them at all.  That's why I have an iPhone, iMac, MacBook, and 2 iPods.  I am an Apple person, because their support and availability is outstanding!

VI have another 5 star experience with this store.  I had a problem with my Time Capsule.  I scheduled the appointment two days ago for this morning at 11:30.  A few minutes before the time, Goran came over and checked to see I was the person he was to help.\u000a\u000aWithin a few minutes, he had checked the soft reset I had done with my TC.  He entered some more information and I was up and running again in no time.\u000a\u000aI have paid a premium for owning Apple items but it has always been worth it in ease of use, magnificent design, and support like this!  Bravo!  Thanks, Goran!

VThis is absolutely one of those must visit places.  It's also a place you must visit more than once to explore.  \u000a\u000aI've been here before, but I never took the time to explore and see what really was here.  My curiosity was piqued when I rode my bike along the Flamingo Wash to the Las Vegas Wash on the other side of the Wetlands Park.  Then I knew I had to come back and explore further.\u000a\u000aOnce you get beyond the Duck Creek concrete trail, you arrive at the Dragonfly Divide.  It's from this trail at the Wetlands Park that you can walk over to the Las Vegas Wash east of the sewage treatment plant and see the water as it makes its way to Lake Mead.\u000a\u000aThe amount of water that leaves Las Vegas every day is incredible, and it comes through this area where it is cleansed more by the reeds, stones, and the open air.\u000a\u000aThe water fowl in various ponds are beautiful to see.  This is a truly fantastic place to be away from the world for awhile and be alone with the animals and plants.

VWe came here instead of waiting in the lines at the buffet or coffee shop.  Chips, salsa, and bean dip are standard.  The bean dip was a bit smoother a more moist than many places and it made it great for dipping.\u000a\u000aI had the carnitas and my wife had the chicken ranchero.  Both are served with refried or charro beans and Mexican rice.  This is simple Tex/Mex food and they do it well.\u000a\u000aOur server was very much on top of things.  When I asked for Cholula, he told me he'd bring me something.  He came from the kitchen with a cup of nicely hot salsa that is kept there and served if requested.  It could have been hotter, but it did the trick for my taste buds.\u000a\u000aWe've been here before and we'll be back.

VI come here once a year to see the Cactus Garden at night with the Christmas lights.  It is such a treat to see.  I also enjoy watching the chocolatiers at work if the factory is running.  Last night, it wasn't.  Last year when I stopped in, I saw them making some Valentine's Day boxes and it was quite interesting.  This is also a good place to take out of town visitors to see the gardens in the daytime even when not decorated. \u000a\u000aI am not a fan of the price of the chocolate.  I think it's way overpriced.  \u000a\u000aTip #1:  If you go to see the lights and you don't have children, go about 9 PM.  The gardens are open until 10.  At that time, most if not all the little ones have gone home, and you almost have the gardens to yourself.  It's heaven.\u000a\u000aTip #2:  On the way, point out Wayne Newton's house and look at the fin of his jet parked on the other side of the wall.  It looks like something out of a bad Jaws movie.

VThis is one of those great Las Vegas places for window shopping and people watching. I haven't bought anything here, but I've spent several hours exploring the shops.  Bauman Rare Books is one of those fantastic stores where you want to walk around with your hands tied behind your back because you don't want to touch anything and leave a print on anything.  What an interesting shop.\u000a\u000aI also window shop and the tie shop and I smile when I think that I know longer have to wear a tie unless i want to.  \u000a\u000aThose are just two of the neat places in the Shoppes at the Palazzo.  I sometimes wonder how some stay in business because they're almost hiding in plain sight, but many people don't know the extent of the shoppes nor the different hallways that take you to different shops on different floors.

VI went to the Lounge at the Palms to see Rick Faugno, who formerly played the part of Frankie Valli in Jersey Boys at the Venetian.  The lounge is a perfect, small venue for this kind of entertainment.  There were probably a hundred people there.\u000a\u000aIt's an intimate room.  I do have to agree with other comments about how close the seating is.  The cocktail waitress, a very slim, pretty thing, had a hard time navigating through the chair and table maze.  Faugno at one time, when he came into the audience, got himself blocked from returning to the stage until he figured an alternate route out of the maze.\u000a\u000aThe lighting and sound were done very well and enhanced the performance.\u000a\u000aI have one major complaint--the price of drinks.  I realize where I live and I know the Palms is a "hot spot" for the young things, but $4 for a bottle of water!  I should have gotten a free water from a waitress in the casino and given her a good tip.  It would have been 1/2+ less than what I paid in the showroom.  That's almost nightclub kind of pricing.  \u000a\u000aI'd come back to the Lounge given the entertainment was appealing to me.  But, I've learned a few things, and I'd make my visit a better experience!

VI had a $25 Groupon about to expire, so we stopped here for dinner on the way to Town Square.  I had the Choo-Chee shrimp spiciness 3 out of 5.  My wife had the Garlic Garlic stir fry with chicken, 0 spiciness.  We had an order of fried egg rolls for a starter.\u000a\u000aThe meal was excellent.  I could have ordered a level 4 spiciness, but now I have an idea of their index of heat.  Andrea was thrilled with the amount of garlic with her chicken and the rich brown sauce with the chicken.\u000a\u000aWe ended the meal splitting the molten chocolate cake which was warmed.\u000a\u000aI am really glad Groupon helped me find another good Thai restaurant and I know I'll be doing take out from here for the Garlic garlic chicken in the future.

V*** Review for Spring Restaurant Week 2014 menu ***\u000a\u000aThis would be a three star review if not for the outstanding service we received.  This was an afterthought when I was looking at the RW offerings.  I decided it was wife friendly (it's difficult to get her to try different things).  \u000a\u000aWe came here in the late afternoon.  I had checked the times online and the Tommy Bahama website said dinner was from 4 on.   We were there at 4:30 and got the lunch RW menu and were told that dinner service begins at 5 PM.  That's where our server, Naomi, showed us what the service would be like.  She went to the kitchen and then came back.  After collecting our lunch menus, she went to the stand and brought back the dinner menus.\u000a\u000aI started with the coconut shrimp with an Asian slaw.  The shrimp were resting on a mango-papaya chutney.  My wife had the classic Caesar--romaine leaves with Grana Padano cheese and garlic croutons.  Both were good starters.  My shrimp  had little coconut flavor.\u000a\u000aDuring our starters, Naomi brought some hot bread from the kitchen.  They serve the bread with a cinnamon butter which is quite good.  I thought it was odd that they had no bread plates.  I happened to have my starter plater so I could use that.\u000a\u000aFor the main courses, I got the pork loin and my wife got the parmesan crusted Sanibel chicken breast--a selection not shown on their online RW menu but a good choice.  Naomi asked how I liked the pork--medium and I said rare to medium-rare.  I didn't want the meat too dead.  It was cooked too much and it wasn't a bit juicy.  It was a huge loin--almost like they took a loin and cut it in half.  It was served with asparagus and 6 silver dollar size sweet potato pancakes.  The sides were very good!  My wife's chicken was good.  Her chicken came on a bed of garlic mashed and some broccolini.  \u000a\u000aFor dessert, I got the piña colada cake and my wife got the four layer triple chocolate cake.  Excellent and once again, a large portion.\u000a\u000aIced tea was refilled promptly without asking.  Naomi was always around without being intrusive and she had a sparkling personality!  She makes this a 4 star review.\u000a\u000a** I apologize for only having two photos.  I forgot to bring my Yelp camera and my phone went dead after just two.

VI've been wanting to try Simon and generally drive by without thinking about it.  Yesterday, I went for a late breakfast.  My first reaction to the Palms Place was that it's dark!!  I found the elevators and made it to the 6th floor where Simon is located.\u000a\u000aThere were two other parties in the restaurant and we all were seated in different sections so I had the main dining area to myself.  I asked to be seated along the windows to enjoy the view and watch the pool area.  Little did I know, there would be some crazy tourists who came out and got in the heated Jacuzzi.  He tried the main pool for about 15 seconds and then went back to the heated water.\u000a\u000aI was brought coffee quickly and it was refilled several times during my time there.  My server was Christy and she was great!  I ordered the peaches and cream pancakes.  They're three large pancakes with some peach compote and whipped cream on top.  Its' too bad they didn't have a short stack order because these cakes are large and filling.  I left half on my plate rather than stuff myself.\u000a\u000aBreakfast was fine and enjoyed the sunshine and the view of the pool.

VWe went to see the show tonight.  This was my second time seeing Fator and my wife's first.  We both enjoyed the show a lot!    Fator has improved his delivery and stage presence since I saw him a few years ago at the Hilton.  The 90 minutes go by so quickly.\u000a\u000aThe warm up DJ was a lot of fun, and his dancing is quite funny.  Fator's band is excellent and provides superb accompaniment for his singing.  \u000a\u000aThe staging is well done and the big screens would help someone who wasn't near the front.\u000a\u000aAll in all, this is a great show, lots of fun, smiles, and jokes.  Very enjoyable!

VThe Shimmer Showroom is home to several Hilton productions.  I came to see Gilbert Gottfried on his last night as part of the "Icons of Comedy" being staged in the theatre.\u000a\u000aThe room is a small venue with plenty of seats.  I was about the last person in line, and I wondered whether we'd all fit downstairs.  We did and there were seats left over.\u000a\u000aI've always found the staff to be very pleasant.  The usher took me the the third row center area and told me to take any seat I wanted.  \u000a\u000aIt was a good show and a nice venue.  My only problem with the place is the seats are placed awfully close to one another.  Luckily, last night I could leave a seat on either side of me empty, so I had plenty of room.

VI ate here 19 October 2009. I had the chicken wrapped in it skin, an order of pig cheek, and the house special home made tofu. The day's special was half cold tofu and half warm tofu. All was wonderful. What a cozy place with an absolutely wonderful staff. They truly made the dining experience special.

V3.5 stars\u000a\u000aThis buffet has been through more ups and downs over the years than the NY NY roller coaster.  We went tonight and it was one of the up times.  My review of the foods:\u000a\u000aPrime rib - excellent - very rare - it looked like they just walked the cow through the kitchen and then carved.\u000a\u000aChinese eggplant - really good\u000a\u000aTuna salad - very bland\u000a\u000aYellow curry chicken - very good curry flavor but no heat - on a spiciness scale of 1 - 10, this was a -2.\u000a\u000aCat fish strips - average - something from Mrs. Paul's kitchen\u000a\u000aSushi - the fish was so small and the rice was so plentiful, if you played a game of hide and seek, you'd never find the fish amidst the rice.\u000a\u000aShrimp and pork pot stickers - average\u000a\u000aDesserts - mini-Napoleon - wonderful, mini cream puff - average, sugar free carrot cake - top notch.\u000a\u000aWe'll return.  Of course we will!

VAgain, 3.5 stars.  (And I say that the same way Jay Rayner says the hoff in 3.5).  \u000a\u000aBasic, locals buffet.  The food was good.  The glazed carrots were a bit too sweet, but I made up for it by having sugar free desserts.  :)\u000a\u000aThe prime rib was excellent again, and I liked the catfish and chicken sausages.  The egg roll was very good.\u000a\u000aService was very quick and Rafael was quite nice.  The place was almost empty.  Wow, are they hurting for business.\u000a\u000aA good value considering we had two free buffets.\u000a\u000aPS:  I added some photos because  the poor little place had not yet had any posted so I had to take the camera and get some for Yelp.  Some people looked at me like I had two heads, but it's their problem.

VI'm really conflicted about this place.  The food was good, but not that much better than any other take out in my general area.  We ate in which also colors my review.\u000a\u000aThe first thing that struck me when we went in was how messy every table was.  At that point, I asked my wife if she wanted to do take out instead, but she said we'd wait.  A gentleman who just finished his complimentary egg drop soup while he was waiting for his takeout, got up from his table and offered it to us.  It was at this time that the woman showed up.  She cleaned off the table and we were seated by the door.\u000a\u000aFrom then, it was a bit of a wait for her to cover the few tables in the place, answer the phone, and give take out orders to people as they came in.  After a fair amount of time--nothing outrageous--she came to take our order.  My wife wanted the garlic chicken.  I wanted the pork with garlic sauce which was listed on the menu as hot and spicy.  She questioned each of us on what type of vegetables we liked.  I didn't understand this, but when I ordered, I guess she assumed we would be sharing and since my wife already had ordered a garlic dish, I wouldn't want the same.  Again, a discussion of what kind of vegetables I liked.  She then suggested I get one of two other pork dishes.  I ended up ordering the twice cooked pork.  I really didn't come for a discussion on vegetables as well intentioned as that might have been.\u000a\u000aWe got a complimentary cup of egg drop soup which was good.  My wife liked her chicken with garlic sauce and I liked my twice cooked pork, but it wasn't spicy.  And, during the meal, I couldn't help look at the table ahead and to my left where every dirty dish from every other table ended up for a temporary home, but they stayed there during the hour plus we were in the restaurant.  I realize it's a mom and pop operation but when there are only 4 tables, it becomes an issue.\u000a\u000aI liked the woman.  She was quite friendly and had a good sense of humor.  If I come back, it will be for takeout only and I'll call in advance.  I think I've sworn off Chinese food in the neighborhood.  I'll stick to Thai food and get Chinese in Chinatown.

VI stopped in yesterday looking to buy something sweet to take home.  I found it - their carrot cake cookie.  Wow, what a great dessert.  I need to learn to cut things in half and set aside some to enjoy later.\u000a\u000aAs it turned out, this was a non-vegan cookie, and that's fine with me.  The stop gave me a chance to scope out the place and know that I want to come back and try some more things.

VI stopped in for a quick treat.  This place would rate 5 stars if they had some interior seating.  Instead, unless you stand, the only seats are outside on the sidewalk in Town Square.  With the wind howling at 40+ miles an hour, I was lucky to be somewhat sheltered by the building.\u000a\u000aI tried some of their newer flavor - Devil's Food Cup Cake Batter.  It was one of the creamiest frozen yogurts I've had.  Rich, full flavor chocolate.  Wow!  What's not to like?  A little coconut and some chocolate pieces and I had the fuel needed to see me through the 3 hour movie awaiting me.

VI stopped here yesterday to get to specific items that are sold by Fresh & Easy--their peanut butter filled pretzels and the spicy cheese sticks.  These are snacks our hiking group likes and they're always stocked here. This isn't my go to food store, but there are some specialty items I like buying here.

VI did a kayaking trip with Evolution Expeditions in September 2008.  It was a super day.  Since they have their home in Summerlin, their first stop for pick up is at Red Rock Resort.  I drove there and parked in the garage.  They arrived right on time, and one person from the hotel went with me as the van took us to the Hacienda Hotel where the groups get their paperwork in order with the government person.  This is necessary because of the heightened security at the dam.\u000a\u000aFrom the Hacienda, we were driven to the launch area just south of Hoover Dam along the Colorado.  It was a wonderful morning with lots of sun and little wind.  \u000a\u000aThere are several stops as you make your way from hoover Dam to Willow Beach in Arizona--an 11 mile trip.  The first stop is at Sauna Cave, a long test boring done before the dam was constructed.  There is very warm water that steams up camera lenses quickly, and for some people, claustrophobia may be a problem.  Sauna Cave is only a 1/2 mile or so down the river.  \u000a\u000aThe next stop is lower Goldstrike Canyon.  There are several hot springs in the canyon and a few warm waterfalls.  There is one area where the water temperatures are about 110 degrees.  Goldstrike is only a few hundred yards south of Sauna Cave.  \u000a\u000aFrom here, you kayak 3+ miles to the Arizona Hot Springs, which is about 4 miles from the beginning of the trip.  Here you get a chance to climb up a new ladder that goes to the hot springs beyond this waterfall.  Since I got careless before arriving here, my camera got wet when I tipped my kayak getting out and I have no photos from here on except the ones when I hiked to the Hot Springs.\u000a\u000aAfter the springs, you travel 3 more miles and then stop for a lunch break.  After the lunch break, the trip continues downstream where you can see Emerald Cave and then the river gauging system before finishing the last two miles to Willow Beach.  The Evolution van will be waiting.  You just get out, go get a soda or snack, and they load the kayaks onto the trailer.  Then they drive you back to your hotel.\u000a\u000aThis was a super day.  It is a great way to spend a day enjoying the scenery near Las Vegas.  From the look of the photos already posted, I went the wrong day.  (Big sigh!)  :)

VI haven't been to this theatre for a long time because I have two others that are closer to me.  I came here last night to see the Royal Ballet's Sleeping Beauty.  This theatre shows many of the Opera in Theatre or Ballet in Theatre offerings.  They do not bring the Met in HD, so I go elsewhere.\u000a\u000aThe theatre was clean and comfortable.  This was a 7 PM screening and since it seems that many Las Vegans are out of town on end of summer vacations, there was no wait at the ticket booth.\u000a\u000aA pleasant place.  I'll be back as they continue to screen these special events and some art and foreign films you won't find elsewhere.

VFantastique!\u000a\u000aI have been planning to go to Robuchon for a long time but never went.  Last night before seeing MGM's Crazy Horse Paris before it closes, I decided to make it a grand evening of food and entertainment.\u000a\u000aThe meal.  I selected the 6 course meal.  For an amuse-bouche, they brought a bowl of avocado foam with grapefruit and apple.  Smoke was coming out from the sides of the bowl from a couple of pieces of dry ice concealed in the lower section.  The bowl was sitting on a plate that had apples all over it.  The smoking bowl and the apple plate went with the restaurant's fall theme.  It was very pleasing to the eye and to the palate.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0Hg#_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0Hg\u000a\u000aBefore the first course, the server came with the bread cart.  I chose a bacon bread and a basil roll.  He took them away to be warmed and while they were being warmed, he pulled a nice curl of butter from the large bell shaped mound of butter.  On this curl, he spooned some coarse sea salt.  Perfect!\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0Hg#cG0hupMF2hno9oNJFQzTFA\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0Hg#vhZqX8iJde17fytPkzjdYg\u000a\u000aThe first course was spiced lobster in a cold cauliflower soup with botargo shavings.  This was excellent.  The lobster and the cauliflower made a good combination.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0Hg#qEPSaCG4mph3gwtwMSCgkA\u000a\u000aSecond course was a pumpkin velouté with foie gras, ginger foam, and toasted seeds.  The pumpkin velouté was poured into the foam from a separate container by the server.  There were also small cubes of pumpkin for texture in the velouté.  Very tasty pumpkin flavor with the lovely ginger to add an extra layer of flavor.  The foie gras was superb!\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0Hg#Yoc7fLdK93DmTfocE3vS2g\u000a\u000aFor the third course, I went back to lobster.  I got the spiny lobster served with yucca root in a green curry with fresh coriander.  Another winner.  Very good.  \u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0Hg#vMMAmXsQT8J7zxTXCmYRqA\u000a\u000aFor the fourth course, I chose a special that wasn't on the menu.  They had lamb chops and lamb loin.  It was very flavorful.  With this course, they brought some pommes purée and a finger bowl with a slice of lemon and one rose petal.  After all, you have to clean your fingers after picking up the lamb chop to finish the meat from the bone.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#anOfKURZUpLKafsNDbh6ew\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#QtU_80wjNrJZwFrVkYQpOg\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#zFf11ODymwTGaz2wovhjiA\u000a\u000aThe 5th course was the cheese course.  By now, I was feeling full and I knew there were more good things to come.  I chose three cheeses--some bleu, a French hard cheese similar to manchego, and a soft sheep's milk cheese.  All three were good, but the bleu was outstanding!\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#1ZeLTWxdkqNNrSQ0cK09zw\u000a\u000aWith the cheese course, you were brought a raisin roll.  It really adds to the cheese flavors.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#zAdat0jo4ZV4Z5YH-fhq9Q\u000a\u000aFor the last course, dessert, I ordered the pistachio mousse glazed with chocolate ganache and raspberry gelée.  Heavenly, rich, dark chocolate!!\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#XqZUNyWMVX8_poZCZExiMw\u000a\u000aLast, the mignardises trolley was wheeled to the table. Wow.  Such a choice.  I took three, a dark chocolate demi-macaron, a vanilla macaron, and a small tartlet with raspberry and cream.  What a delightful way to end a meal and now I was very full.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#wf4xOVg4-mfqu0liI7xk6Q\u000a\u000aService was exemplary!  There wasn't one staff member who wasn't polite and who didn't have a smile.  The whole package--the food, the fall theme with the flowers of reds and oranges, the plates with apples and pumpkins, the service and the general ambience of this quiet, elegant restaurant--makes for a fine dining experience.  I'd love to go back and try the 14 course menu but I'm afraid I couldn't eat that much. \u000a\u000aThanks to my Yelp friends who encouraged me to go here and gave me pointers, especially Rod and Marcus!

VI agree with the other posters that this place is over-priced.  I stopped here today to get some low carb products that I don't order when it's hot as shipping to the desert during the summer is not smart.\u000a\u000aThe bars were priced better than they have been.  The young lady at the counter was quite nice, and the prices were there so I knew what I was paying.\u000a\u000aThis is my go to place when the heat prevents me from buying online and having it shipped in.

VI expected much more from this restaurant.  I met two relatives who were from out of town and were staying at Wynn.  I had the warm goat cheese salad.  It was good but small in size.  For the main course, I had Veal Picatta.  There were two small slices of very thin veal.  The sauce was a bit salty, something I never say - until now.  I got a side of crispy fried potatoes with truffle oil and parmesan cheese.  It turned out to be french fries with some oil and cheese sprinkled over the top.  The potatoes were $7.\u000a\u000aThe prices are too high even for a name restaurant in a property like Wynn.  For $59 before tip, I expect more food, better presentation, and the finest cooking.

V*** Review for Spring Restaurant week 2014 menu ***\u000a\u000aWhat a great way to end Restaurant Week!  I had a reservation and asked to be seated on the patio (the Terrace, the occupancy sign says).  The sun was in my face for about 15 minutes before going before going behind Treasure Island.  It was a great evening to sit out and enjoy the outstanding Las Vegas weather.\u000a\u000aI was seated a few seconds when my server, Casey, came and took my drink order.  My iced tea was delivered quickly.  A different server came to take my order.  There was no Restaurant Week menu sheet with my regular menu so she just told me some of the choices.  After making my choices, a runner came by with aluminum foil wrapped garlic bread with a dish of marinara on the side.  Super garlic bread and very good marinara!\u000a\u000aBack to ordering.  For course one, I went with crispy fried calamari.  It came with a side of the same tasty marinara as the garlic bread.  The serving size was huge.  This would definitely be an appetizer to share with one or two other people.  I sent almost half of it back so as not to fill up on calamari but I could have finished the plate.  Lightly breaded and fried lightly, it was very good!\u000a\u000aI chose the penne alla vodka for course two.  It was a good sized serving and it was very good.  I slowly ate the penne enjoying each bite and forcing myself to have more garlic bread.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I opted for the raspberry cheesecake.  The cheesecake was lightly flavored with raspberry--just barely noticeable.  The top was crisp from lightly torching the top like you would a crème brûlée.  There were several black cherries on the plate that was a good accompaniment for the cheesecake.\u000a\u000aService was excellent.  Casey came by often and topped off my iced tea, dishes were removed promptly by bus people, and my check was taken for payment by someone who had not been at my table at all.  It was a case of everyone watching how all the guests were doing.

VI've been to Seasons several times and it's OK.  They generally have something that grabs my attention and there's something that wants me to take away a star.  When we ate here Sunday, that stayed as usual.  \u000a\u000aThe grilled vegetables were very good.  I always like their roasted garlic pieces, but this night, the roast beef was cooked until the cow could walk no more.  It was deep, deep brown.  Overcooked completely!\u000a\u000aThe spicy tofu in the Asian section was very good and the deserts rounded out the evening on the plus side.  I had some peach ice cream and a piece of carrot cake.  A nice way to end a meal.\u000a\u000aThe service was very good.  There weren't very many people in the restaurant Sunday night so the servers were stretched to the limit.  I'll come back here and I'll find something quite good again and something that I avoid or isn't quite as good.  The place has lost some of the luster it had when it first opened.

VWe got a mailer for one free night.  We decided to take them up on the offer.  The hotel us quite pleasant with tastefully done rooms.  We had a lovely room on the 4th floor overlooking the roof of the casino, but I could see Black Mountain in Henderson quite well.  What more do I want from a free room?\u000a\u000aWe had requested one king, but we ended with 2 doubles instead.  No problem.  The room is a good size.  There is a refrigerator, but there is no sneaky honors bar which is great!  They do offer wifi, but it is not free.  There's a $12.99 charge per day.  I checked the website before we went, and I saw that wifi was available in all rooms.  The key word - available.  But, there's no resort fee so it's almost a wash.\u000a\u000aThere's a nice large table/desk with reading lamp.  There's also a place to plug a Cat 5 cable.  I didn't try it to see if I could have internet access without the fee.  It's better being able to sit in bed while reading reviews on Yelp done by friends.\u000a\u000aThere's a bar in the rooms that extends into the room by the sink.  It would be convenient if you were having a party or guests for drinks.  You could drown your sorrows after another UNLV loss nearby.  There was an abundance of very hot water and the tub/shower combo was very large.  It delivers.\u000a\u000aI liked the place and I liked our 1 night stay.

VI have seen over 10 shows in the Colosseum.  I really like this venue.  The only thing that keeps it from getting the 5th star is the absolute ridiculous prices of their drinks.  \u000a\u000aThe staff is very good at assisting the 4,000 people a night that come for shows.  The process of leaving is very smooth.  Last night, I went to see Rod Stewart.  The show ended at 9:30.  I was back to my house just before 10 PM, a drive of about 10 miles.  Their knowing how to get people out of the theatre is impressive.\u000a\u000aThe theatre is quite nice.  The sound system is first rate.  But other than the performers themselves, the star of the evening is the LED screen behind the performer.  Stewart made good use of its capabilities.  Elton John on the other hand didn't use it much depending instead on stage props and signs.\u000a\u000aI was even at the Colosseum for a lecture by former President Bill Clinton.  It was a wonderful place for such a mundane thing as that.

VI met several friends for a casual lunch.  Feast would be more like it.  The Yelp friend who organized the lunch had pre-ordered what we were getting.  We had a table reserved in the back of this somewhat small mom and pop Italian restaurant.\u000a\u000aFirst, drinks were brought quickly when we ordered and refills were constant throughout our two hour lunch.  And then the food started coming.  First up was some bread--classic Italian bread and mini garlic knots.  Very tasty.  Maybe a little more garlic is needed for my taste but good nonetheless.\u000a\u000aNext up were some starter dishes.  We got two orders of what they call Lasagna Explosions and 2 orders of Rice Balls Montesano.  There were eight of us and the plates were such that there were 8 rice balls so everyone could have a try and 12 lasagna explosions.  The rice balls were breaded and deep fried with sauce and cheese.  The lasagna explosions consisted of rolled lasagna, breaded and deep fried and served with sauce.  The sauce was very good and it wasn't sweet.  They had the good sense to hold back on the sugar.\u000a\u000aThen came the second stage, the pizzas.  We were brought three different pizzas, a white pizza, a Sicilian fresca (Margarita), and a regular cheese pizza.  I had a piece of the white pizza and one piece of the Sicilian fresca.  My favorite was the Sicilian fresca.  Very tasty and thick crust the way I like pizza.  And you could have guessed it by now, each pizza was cut into eight slices so we all could have a slice of each.\u000a\u000aThe next course was for the serious eating.  We got two orders of sausage and meatballs, two orders of seafood in garlic cream over linguini, two orders of eggplant Parmigiano with ziti, and an order of tripe.  The first two dishes had their meat sauce and were quite good.  The seafood consisted of shrimp, mussels, calamari, and conch over fettuccine in the garlic cream sauce.  I could have had a bit more garlic in the cream sauce.  \u000a\u000aThen came dessert.  We got an order of Zeppole and we were each brought a small plate with a cookie, a cannoli, and their three color cookie.  Desserts were very good.  By now, no one wanted to move we had eaten so much.\u000a\u000aService throughout the meal was excellent.  As I said before, drinks were refilled quickly, plates were cleared, dishes being brought to the table were explained, and the two members of the staff that kept us happy were excellent.  One was Toniann, and I apologize I don't know the name of the other.  The were plenty of smiles and good humor from the ladies and at the end of the meal, they boxed leftovers in separate boxes, marking each so we could bring something home.  My wife had leftover ziti and eggplant and she was quite happy.  I didn't have to cook except to press a few buttons on the microwave.  \u000a\u000aReally nice lunch with some great company and very good food!

VI stopped here yesterday to use a Groupon that was expiring soon.  The restaurant is a small area but quite cozy and pleasant.  \u000a\u000aInstead of chips and salsa, they bring you a nice basket of fried tortillas and bean dip with a small bowl of a little spicy salsa.  You break the tortillas as you want and dip.  \u000a\u000aI ordered the soup of the day which was chicken tortilla soup.  It was a tomato based soup with lots of cheese and real chicken with nice tortilla strips.  It was a thicker soup-quite flavorful and something I'd get again.  A bowl of this soup in the winter would be great!\u000a\u000aFor my main course, I got the Chicken Sarandeado, a grilled chicken breast with their "special spices."  With the platter came rice, pico, some guacamole, and refried beans.  This was another tasty dish for Super Mex.  \u000a\u000aFor dessert, I got the fried ice cream.  It didn't appear as if this ice cream had ever been near a fryer but it was good.  It was simply a ball of vanilla ice cream that had been rolled in a small amount of coating and then frozen.  It was placed in a sweetened tortilla basket and decorated with whipped cream, and some strawberry and chocolate syrup.  Mind you, it was a decadent ending to my meal, but it was not fried as far as I could tell.\u000a\u000aI was tempted to give the place 4 stars but I had one BIG hangup with the service.  For the most part, it was very good.  However, I had just started to eat my soup when a server appeared with my main course and set it down.  Why do you do this?  It seems to happen more in Tex-Mex places than anywhere else.  Cabo at Red Rock was notorious for this.  Can't they do courses like a normal restaurant?

VI went to Ovation to see the musical "Rent."  The venue was really good for this kind of show.  The semi-circular seating with a fairly good size stage.  It was a perfect spot for staging a musical like rent with a small band but a large cast.

VI really give this place 4.5 stars.  After the UYE at the Fremont Street Flightlines, I stopped at the Mix Zone Cafe to give the place a try.  It has such good buzz on Yelp, so why not?  I got the 3 color curry with chicken, of course, and it was quite good.  Their spiciness is on a scale of 1 to 4.  I chose 3 and it could have been a bit hotter so the 4 would have been OK.\u000a\u000aService was prompt, and my server was a delightful woman who was very proud of Mix's Yelp certificate.  I decided not to eat all the curry but to take some home for lunch.  She packed the in a small container and also put a container of rice so I had some rice for my leftovers.  Then she stapled the bag shut so it was easy to carry.  \u000a\u000aI then went to the bathroom to get the requisite photos of the wall art.  She chuckled and told me that one of the people from the shop thought it should be removed, but they decided to leave it as it is.  It's funny!  I love the eclectic nature of their bathroom.  Too bad Mix Zone is not closer to Summerlin.

VI stopped here because I was told they have the best French macarons in Las Vegas.  The woman pointed me to the coconut macaroons.  When I explained what I wanted, she said, "Oh, we don't have them anymore.  That was the only thing we don't make.  We got them from someone else."  \u000a\u000aShe then got on the phone to someone who told her they would be getting a delivery during this week.  I guess I'm not coming back.  Why guess when they'll have something when I can just buy it elsewhere.\u000a\u000aI did buy a cannoli for $4.  It's a bit pricey but it was larger than the miniature ones you see at casino buffets.  It tasted good.  I don't think I'll be a return visitor to BonJour with the other options in Las Vegas.

VI was to the library for a roundtable discussion so I can't review the books nor the study areas.  What I can say is that it is a beautiful building, unlike any library I've ever been in.  I noticed on the way in that the dedication plaque read 2001 so it's somewhat new.\u000a\u000aI knew I was going to the Goldfield Room on the 3rd floor.  I saw the stairs on entering, and I made my way to the 3rd floor.  I studied the map and then saw a sign with an arrow showing visitors where the roundtable was being held.\u000a\u000aThe roundtable was sponsored by the UNLV Special Collections Division.  This division collects and preserves the history of Southern Nevada and especially Las Vegas.  The moderator of the event was Dr. David Schwartz, the Director of the Center For Gaming Research at UNLV.  The Center is part of the UNLV Special Collections Division.\u000a\u000aThe room was large, bright, and the sound system for the discussion was excellent.  What a super place for an event like this.  I hope to go back to the library some day when I have nothing planned and just walk around and browse.

VWe went here last night, something we do about twice a year.  I've generally been pleased with the food I get and that stayed the same last night. \u000a\u000aI started with a cup of the broccoli and cheese soup.  It was very thick and very tasty.\u000a\u000aFor the main course, I had their new Sizzling Cajun Steak and Shrimp.  It was a 7 ounce steak topped with blackened shrimp and Cajun gumbo.  The rub on the steak gave it some zing and the gumbo had some spiciness too.  The shrimp were not blackened, but they were good.  As for the gumbo, it was very tasty but I would have liked to have more than one piece of okra.\u000a\u000aService was very good.  Arnold, our server, was quick and coming to the table to take our order, and he was on top of iced tea refills.  \u000a\u000aMy only complaint was when the music was turned on, it was terribly loud, making a conversation impossible.  I had to almost yell to be heard just across the table.

VTwo of us did the flights on October 5, 2008, not too long after the attraction opened.  It was wonderful.  I have a great fear of heights.  I knew what to expect long before I went on the ride.  I have hiked twice to the top of Red Mountain, the site of the first, and steepest, flight.  I saw this thing as it was being built, and I had no idea what it was.  After finding out, I needed to take the plunge.\u000a\u000aIt was fantastic.  I enjoy every bit of it!  The staff was wonderful.  Except for a few moments of terror before I started, the height thing disappeared.  Two seconds down the first flight, I was hooked!\u000a\u000a\u000aThis is a class operation and tons of fun!!

VAfter seeing the reviews from some good Yelp friends, I knew I had to stop and try Zaytoon.  My friends are right.  This place is great!\u000a\u000aI've only had Persian food once, in Los Angeles, so I'm still learning.  After studying the menu, I went with their KGB sandwich--Koobideh Kabob that's served on their fresh baked bread and served with some sliced onion, plenty of basil greens, a roasted tomato, and a grilled jalapeño.  The beef was excellent.  The juices soaked the bread that covered the entire plate.  I got an iced tea with my dinner.\u000a\u000aService was excellent.  An older man waited on me originally and then was replaced by a younger man--the owner, I believe.  Iced tea was refilled twice with no need to ask for a refill.  The server checked back to make sure everything was OK.\u000a\u000aSince I'm such a babe in the woods with this cuisine, I asked the owner if there was a correct way to eat the food.  He said what I had done was exactly the way he does it.  Let the juices soak the bread and enjoy all the richness of the dish.\u000a\u000aI left without checking out the store section.  When I got home I saw Tony's photo of the ice cream and I wanted to kick myself.  However, with how good this meal was, I'll be a regular.  I have to try some different dishes and enjoy some dessert.

VI was at Town Square and I decided to get some things at this Whole Foods.  It may be my imagination, but the store seemed larger and better stocked than the one I normally go to on West Charleston.\u000a\u000aTheir meat section was very good.  On the other hand, I thought the cheese area had less of a choice than what I'm used to.  I did get some steaks and some vegetables.\u000a\u000aCheckout was quick.  The 10 items or less line was non-existent and I was out of the store quickly.  I'm not sure if I'll be back.  Shopping 10 miles from home when it's not necessary isn't what I do.

VThe Hilton keeps sending me coupons fro a free large coffee at Fortuna, so who am I to not accept?  I wouldn't go out of my way to get coffee here, but I was at the Hilton to get tickets for a show so I got my free drink.\u000a\u000aThey serve brewed Starbuck's coffee.  I got a large iced coffee, and like always, it was bold and very tasty.  I have to stay clear of the desserts in their case. They are so enticing!\u000a\u000aThis is a great stop if you're at or near the Hilton.

VI came here for our Yelp Book Club gathering.  I got an unsweetened black iced tea that was very good.\u000a\u000aThe place is quite nice with several large arm chairs, tables, and a good place for our small group to have our gathering.\u000a\u000aWhat other coffee shop gives you the chance to see Wayne Newton's plane parked in his back yard (well the tail fin and the top of the fuselage).  It reminds me of Jaws!

VI tried Bosa 1 tonight (5/12/10) and it was everything other Yelpers have said.  Thanks for the recommendation.  I had the combination (#9) platter with BBQ short ribs.  The whole meal was super!  I was the only customer in the place at 4:30 PM, but I felt like I would have been treated as well if the small restaurant had been packed.\u000a\u000aThe server, a man, explained everything to me, and he made suggestions as it was my first time there.  It definitely is not my last.\u000a\u000aBTW, he said their new schedule would be to close early on Thursday and remain open on Fridays.  This starts soon.\u000a\u000aThanks Misti!

VI do not go to Fresh and Easy very much.  The stores just aren't appealing to me except for a couple of items--generally snacks.  They have peanut butter filled salted pretzel nubs, some good salted kettle chips, and very decent trail mix for hiking.\u000a\u000aThat's about it for me.  I was going by here yesterday and thought it would be a quick and easy stop and it was.  Since I have no preconceived notion where things should be, I just walk around like a zombie with a purpose to find what I want.\u000a\u000aCheckout was quick--I only had two items, and then I went across the street to Albertsons where I did a bit more serious shopping.

VI am not experienced with BBQ so take that into account when you read this review.  I came here yesterday for take out.  I got two dinner combos--a Georgia chopped pork with the sides of Wilbur beans and garlic red skin mashed potatoes.  The other combo was a Texas beef brisket with sides of potato salad and Dave's cheesy mac and cheese.  Both came with a corn  bread muffin.\u000a\u000aWe enjoyed the dinner, perhaps because it was a different kind of meal for us.  It was quick.  I didn't call the order in but went there and ordered at their To Go section.  The wait was about 5 minutes.  Customer service was very good and I was soon on my way.\u000a\u000aThe only thing I regret is all the plastic used for take out.  Some recyclable, some not.  I think another time, I'd just go and eat there rather than bring home so much that will end in the landfill.\u000a\u000aI'll be back but I need to try some of the other BBQ places in town including one recommended highly by Nelson Q.  He never steers me wrong.

VI've been here several times but never reviewed REI.  I stopped in yesterday to get a new holder for my GPS unit.  I also wanted to look for some new hiking pants and shorts.  \u000a\u000aI found both quickly.  Service was very good.  I find REI to be pricey but I had a rebate coupon to use so that cushioned the bow.\u000a\u000aThey have a very large inventory of almost everything you'd need for the outdoors.

VWow!  What a great meal! The waiter comes to your table with a bread basket with several doughnut hole shaped buns.  They are Brazilian cheese buns dusted with parmesan cheese.  There were excellent!\u000a\u000aI started with the salad bar and took items sparingly.  I tried the cold, sliced portabello muchrooms, one tomato caprese, asparagus risotto, two small artichoke heart halves, and two large shrimps and a piece of fish from their hot seafood mixture.  This was the extent of my salad bar foray as I didn't want to fill up on salad.  It would be a great dinner in itself.\u000a\u000aI turned the coaster to the green side meaning bring on the meat.  Before they started that, a waiter brought three dishes to the table - one with 3 fried plantains, another with mashed potatoes, and a third with green beans with garlic.  These were my vegetables to go with my meat.  A lot of food to accompany a lot of food.\u000a\u000aI didn't try all the meats as I was filling up before they had a chance to bring everything to my table.  I liked the small sausage, the first meat I tasted and it was excellent.  Beautiful seasoning.  Then I had two thin slices of rare prime rib which was excellent also.  I had both the chicken breast wrapped in bacon and the tenderloin wrapped in bacon.  Both were very good.  The seasonings were perfect.  I am a salt user extraordinaire, but I salted nothing except the mashed potatoes and green beans.  I had the garlic picanha (top sirloin) and it was superb!!  I also had one slice of beef rib which is sliced from a rack of rib (large--not baby back) and served on a separate small plate. \u000a\u000aSince there were only two tables occupied in the restaurant, there weren't several guys walking around distributing meat like rodizio restaurants.  Two guys were tasked with the serving.  I didn't get the pork loin and I forgot Tony's mentioning of chicken hearts--damn, damn, damn.  Well, something to look forward to next time.\u000a\u000aAfter all this, I did hold back so I could try some dessert.  I had a slice of peanut butter, chocolate chip cheesecake.  Oh yeah--great!\u000a\u000aService was impecable.  My iced tea was refilled often, staff was always around to answer questions or see if you needed something.  I was greeted at the door by a delightful young lady and she also bid me a kind, smiling farewell!\u000a\u000aThe place is very nicely done.  I love the wine rack that goes almost to the ceiling.  I could see the super ladder inside to extend and reach the highest shelves.\u000a\u000aThis is a great deal with a Groupon.  The Groupon was $21.  The regular price for the rodizio is $42.95.  I'm not sure I'd be back for the full price, but the Groupon certainly makes it a great deal.  Come on Groupon--let's get anohter Via Brasil.  And you know, I'll probably go back and pay the full price if one of my friends from out of town who loves rodizio comes to Las Vegas.  We'll go together!

VI went here last night to see the Shakespeare play Twelfth  Night.  The ticket for the show allowed free admission to the museum.  Some of the things were interesting, but I didn't have a lot of time.  What I did see was OK, but there was nothing earth shattering.  I really agree with Julie S.' review.  She nails it well.

VI stopped here for breakfast to try a different kind of spot.  The grill is located near the entrance to the Canyon Ranch Spa at the Palazzo Hotel.  It's on the third floor and you have to take one of the hotel room elevators beyond the security key check stand.\u000a\u000aFor most of the 45 minutes I was here, I was the only customer.  There was a couple with bathrobes finishing some coffee who then went off to the spa.  It was like having a small, private dining room.  The staff was excellent.  I think they would have given great service even if many or most of the tables had been occupied.\u000a\u000aI had looked at the menu online and decided I'd ask about the daily frittata.  It was spinach with feta cheese.  I like that, but it's nothing special.  I ordered what I'd planned before I went, the Rum-flavored French toast with banana and pineapple served with maple syrup.  The French toast had no rum flavor at all which is good!  It was a simple two pieces of grilled bread - not egg battered and fried - with toppings of sliced banana on one and chopped fresh pineapple on the other.  It was so good that I only used a small amount of maple syrup because I didn't want it to overwhelm the fruit.  Served with the French toast was a small container of fresh fruit.\u000a\u000aThis grill is designed to serve healthy or more healthy food.  There's nutrition information on the menu for most items.  \u000a\u000aCoffee was brought quickly and refilled often.\u000a\u000aThis really was a pleasant breakfast and something off the beaten path right on the Strip.

VI have a like/don't like relationship with this Borders.  I have gone there 3 times after the gym to buy the LA Times, only to find them not opened as long as 10 minutes past opening time.  Twice it was blamed on the computer (gee, I hate that excuse!) and once it was because there was an alarm problem.  \u000a\u000aAfter the 3rd time, I swore I'd never go back.  But, today, there I was in my finest gym wear, and I was eager to buy the Times.  No dice!  They didn't get any today.  I have to cut them slack, though.  It seems as though there were no LA Times anywhere in Summerlin this morning.  \u000a\u000aOK, Borders I'll give you one more try for the Times, but only when I've exhausted other suppliers - like Albertsons.  I do like shopping for books here and coming later in the day when I know they'll be open.

VSnaps was fine for breakfast.  I have been here two or three times for dinner, but I didn't review at that time.\u000a\u000aToday, I had the Build Your Own omelet with spinach, mushrooms, and jack cheese.  Tomato slices instead of potatoes and rye toast.  Price was $5.99.  \u000a\u000aService was very good.  The toast wasn't buttered much in the kitchen and she brought extra butter quickly.\u000a\u000aI like this coffee shop.

VI ate here for the 3rd time last night.  The meal was OK--not great, not terrible, but OK!  Service was OK, too, even a bit on the slow side.\u000a\u000aI ordered the liver and onions and my wife had a ham and cheese sandwich.  Both were prepared well, the portion size was average, and the food was prepared well.  Our drinks were gotten fairly quickly and he came by to refill my iced tea when the glass was 1/2 full.\u000a\u000aI probably would stop here when I was at the South Point again.  It is not a place I would go to just for the food and the experience.

VThey made the two drinks for us quickly and perfectly.  There was no line which was quite surprising.  I was amazed when I saw how easy it was to saunter up, order my drink, and be on my way to my Los Angeles Times.\u000a\u000aI like this outlet in the A gates at McCarran.

VWe got a mass mailing a couple of months ago for Aranya and decided to try the place yesterday.  I ordered take out over the phone.  The order was taken quickly but I was surprised that I was never asked for a name nor a phone number.  Not a good way of doing business.\u000a\u000aWe got an order of Thai egg rolls, an order of Garlic with Black Pepper sauce (extra garlic requested), and an order of Red Curry (Gang Dang) chicken.  My wife thought the chicken was OK but not as described.  The menu notes that it's topped with roasted garlic Thai style but it wasn't.  It wasn't topped with the roasted garlic like every other Thai restaurant from which we've gotten garlic pepper chicken.\u000a\u000aMy red curry with chicken was flavorful.  Their spiciness is done on a 1-4 scale.  I ordered a 3 and it had a nice spice to it.  I also received a small container of ground red pepper to add more spice if I wanted.  I appreciate it when Thai restaurants do this.  The egg rolls were a but greasy something I haven't experienced before when getting them from other places.\u000a\u000aOverall, things were OK, but I don't think I'll be going back.  There are way too many other choices that offer better food at a comparable or lesser price.

VToday was a multiple stop day and I included breakfast on the list of things I had to do.  I've been going to try Mr. Mama's for several months and today was it.\u000a\u000aAs soon as I entered, a server told me to sit anywhere I was comfortable.  That's what they said to everyone entering the restaurant and it's really a nice way of saying, "Come on in.  You're welcome here.  make yourself comfortable."\u000a\u000aI had coffee quickly and the server gave me the password for the wifi which was quite zippy.  I like when it works the way it should.  I ordered the Cali omelette which is Cheddar Jack Cheese, Sausage, Pico de Gallo, Salsa, Sour Cream, Topped with Avocado.  With it came hash brown potatoes and two slices of swirled rye toast.  The menu says all omelettes are made with 4 eggs. \u000a\u000aThe breakfast was really very good.  My coffee was refilled and I had a good time watching the cooks do their thing behind the counter.  They do a fair amount of take out and it was interesting to watch them get the boxes and bags ready.\u000a\u000aMr. Mama's is in the commercial area in the Valley View/Decatur area and there are a number of car repair places there.\u000a\u000aBesides the good taste of the food, the thing I most take away from my visit is the genial nature of the staff.  You are welcome there and they let you know your business is appreciated.  Thank you Mr. Mama!

VThis is a review for the Tiffany Showroom and the new show "Yesterday - A Tribute to the Beatles."  The showroom is quite nice.  There are three main levels.  The top level has individual chairs and some small round tables.  The next level down has banquettes and chairs.  Finally, the floor level has two rows of banquettes and some small table seating.\u000a\u000aThe stage is a good size, and the sound and lighting for tonight's show was excellent.  This tribute show has been well planned.\u000a\u000aReview for the show itself: the guys have good voices and play wonderfully.  They are best when they sing with some harmony.  A few times when one of the guys was singing alone, the sound was not the Beatles but the individual.  When singing in unison, they sounded much closer to the Beatles.\u000a\u000aThe show was almost exactly one hour in length. I wish I could give 3.5 stars because 3 is a bit low but 4 would be too high.

VI had planned to go here many times, but I never got around to it.  Today, I changed that.  As mentioned by other reviewers, the free tour starts at 10:30 AM daily.  That's when the work crew have their lunch break, and the tour leader can talk and describe things without noise from manufacturing.\u000a\u000aThe tour is interesting even for someone like me who is not into auto racing nor do I know much about cars.  I do love to learn, and this was another chance to learn about something which I know little about.\u000a\u000aI enjoyed the stories about Carroll Shelby and other ones the tour leader told.  he had a lot of information and was quite genial.  I'm really glad I finally did this.

VI used to go here often but with better choices available, I haven't been there recently.  We went here this evening.  The food is OK.  There are no real standouts.  Like other buffets, the variety of food has been cut back.  This was very noticeable at the salad bar.  Much of it was ice with many fewer bowls spread over the area.\u000a\u000aI was going to get some jambalaya as I had in the past, but it looked liked there were cubes of processed ham instead of the sausage they used to have.  I skipped this dish.  I did get some salt and pepper fried oysters.  They were very tasty, but the breading was quite think and soft--a problem with some buffet food items.\u000a\u000aThey did have some nice vegetables--cauliflower in a cheese sauce (a little watery) and brussel sprouts with pieces of cooked bacon.  \u000a\u000aA summary would be that the buffet is OK.  The food is very standard cafeteria type with nothing really outstanding.  I think the lunch buffet is a better value.

VI have eaten here so many times I couldn't count them all.  Let's limit my review to last Sunday and this Sunday.  Last week, I had the prime rib, extra rare, and it was red.  A little too done, but I could live with red.\u000a\u000aTonight I had the California Cobb salad.  Nice mix of the usual suspects that make up the Cobb.  \u000a\u000aIt had been awhile since I had been here prior to last Sunday.  They have redone part of the interior to break up the large expanse of tables.  Now, they have several quad booths in the main eating area.  The booths have for separate seating areas for up to 4 people - perhaps more.  It breaks up the room and gives you and sense of privacy instead of the large open area.\u000a\u000aI have to agree with some of Kyle's comments about service.  Service has been spotty depending on the server one gets.  We had Pat, a lovely, petite Asian woman who is a competent person.  Service from other servers has been slow, and the bus staff must be the most recent dropouts from the Clark County School District.  I think our bus person tonight was such a non-entity.  I wonder how long he'll last.\u000a\u000aI will eb back.  The prices are good, and the food is good.

VThe Clark County Museum is a great place to see the houses of yesterday from the Basic Magnesium home of Henderson to the other homes of the era.  Looking inside and seeing the furniture and the ways our lives have changed is quite interesting.  Heritage Street is a time capsule of how we lived in the Las Vegas Valley.\u000a\u000aMake sure you spend time looking at the main museum items too.  Much of this was owned by Anna Parks who was the owner of many of the items that are on display.  Her collection of "stuff" from the area is marvelous and her collection of Indian baskets is superb!\u000a\u000aEnjoy the County museum.  It's a bit of a drive from the western part of the Valley, but it's well worth it.  While at the museum gift shop, look for a book called "Asphalt Memories" by the museum director Mark Hall-Patton.  It's a small paperback book that tells you how many of the streets in the Valley got named.  If you're a Las Vegas history nut, this is just the book for you.\u000aIn fact, this brief visit of mine to the museum was to pick up a copy of the book to give to a friend.

VThis was our second stop at their Suncoast location.  The food was good - the service was not.  We waited at the door for quite awhile before we were seated.   I almost answered the ringing phone for them.  By the time the guy did get to it, the people had hung up.  Maybe they thought they were closed.  I wouldn't sit in the bar area again.  Too loud!  Live and learn!

VWe gave the place another try tonight because of two promotions at this location.  It was a complete reversal of the last less than delightful visit.  \u000a\u000aWe were seated in the restaurant area which was much quieter than the bar area, and I could watch the damn Patriots throw the game away to the Jersey Giants.  Oh well, that's not why we were here.\u000a\u000aThis location is doing an "Eat Like a High Roller" promotion through the end of December.  It's $10 off when you spend $25 or more.  That's a good discount.  I ordered their steak and lobster promotion.  I got a 6 ounce sirloin done rare the way I requested, two sides, and a cup of clam chowder.  The steak and lobster is $13.99 and the soup added for $1.99.  That's a great value and everything was very good!\u000a\u000aMy wife ordered their sizzling chicken and cheese with a double side of broccoli.  She brought one of the chicken breasts home and she enjoyed her meal.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I got a slice of red velvet cake with vanilla ice cream.  Total for the two of us after the $10 off was $35.  That included two iced teas.\u000a\u000aOur server was Olivia and she was a gem.  Delightful young lady with a great personality and good service.  I'll ask for her another time when we're there.  I am a fan!

V**** 3.5 stars ****\u000a\u000aWe had a Restaurant.com certificate for what is now called Alexis Gardens and used it tonight before a show.  Our server, Brenda, was excellent!   My wife is a fussy eater.  She wanted a chicken dish and the Chicken Oscar seemed what she wanted except the "Oscar" part.  Brenda made sure that the "Oscar" part, the lump crabmeat and the bernaise sauce were put in separate cups so I could have them and my wife had a plain chicken breast with extra grilled asparagus.  I ordered the ribeye steak which came with mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.\u000a\u000aThe steak was cooked black and blue as I requested and my side of crabmeat was delicious.  The bernaise sauce was a bit salty so I only used a small amount.  For dessert, I hade a piece of carrot cake which was standard, but good.\u000a\u000aI would give this restaurant four full stars except for the lack of menu selection.  The menu is quite limited.  Therefore, I deducted the 1/2 star from 4.  \u000a\u000aAgain, service was outstanding and the food was very good!

VNon hotel guest review:\u000a\u000aI love Aria for its class, it's shape, the public art that is scattered throughout, for the large upstairs walkways and restaurants.  There is so much that I admire about the place.  \u000a\u000aThe Lumia Fountain in the porte cochere is a spectacular thing to see even in daylight.  The wood paneling at the concierge was recycled from the old Boardwalk Hotel that was on this site, an idea I think was superb.\u000a\u000aThe Elvis Theatre on the second floor has some interesting art across from the entrance, and there's more near the buffet.\u000a\u000aNo review would be complete without mentioning the Holzer art in the North Valet pickup area.  It's stunning to see, especially at night.  I've been surprised that a Las Vegas casino would be so forward looking as to install this art.\u000a\u000aThe property appeals to me a lot in many ways.

VI have visited the Mandarin Oriental twice--after it first opened and two days ago.  I have not been a guest at the hotel.  I simply went as a local "tourist" who wanted to see the public art in the ground floor lobby and the 23rd floor Sky Lobby. \u000a\u000aEveryone at the hotel both times was extremely courteous and helpful.  You can tell that guest service is number one priority at this property.  The first time I was there, I asked the woman at the door if it was OK to go to the Sky Lobby to view the art and she said, "Of course, go right ahead!"  \u000a\u000aThe hotel's public areas are very classy.  The decor is quite nice.  Riding to the 23rd floor Sky Lobby in an elevator with a bench seat brought a smile to my face.\u000a\u000aYesterday I came back to the Mandarin Oriental to have breakfast in the MOzen Bistro on the 3rd floor.  Again, all staff were extremely pleasant and helpful.  I also went up to the Sky Lobby to get that wonderful view of this section of the Las Vegas Strip and part of CityCenter.\u000a\u000aOne of these days I'll spend a night here.

V4.5 stars\u000a\u000aToday was the first time I bought poke at a store.  Until now, I only had poke when I ate out.  All three of the varieties I bought - wasabi ahi poke, garlic style shrimp poke, and kimchee style poke were excellent!  What a great dinner!!\u000a\u000aThe staff was very, very pleasant and the young woman who got my order gave me a garlic shrimp to try.  It convinced me to split my 1/2 pound shrimp order into two types.\u000a\u000aThe price is very reasonable.  Now if it wasn't so far from where I live, I'd stop more often.  Ever think of opening a Summerlin Poke Express?

VAnother joy of living in Las Vegas is the ability to see the fountains any day.  I am never on Las Vegas Boulevard that I don't put the window down to hear the music and get a quick look at the fountains.  Sometimes, I play tour leader and station myself along the sidewalk by the fountains to take photos of couples who want to be in a photo together.\u000a\u000aThere's something soothing and very pleasant about the fountains.  The idea for this display was fantastic!  What a lovely way to welcome someone to the property.\u000a\u000aIf you visit in the mornings, you can generally see the raft with fountain crew going about tending to the jets and lights.  The raft comes out of an area under Olives Restaurant that's referred to as the Bat Cave.  These men and women tend to the fountain and make sure it's in great shape for the daily shows.\u000a\u000a5 stars always for this grand Las Vegas experience.

VI've been to this buffet three or four times.  I think it is very good.  Some of the outstanding dishes from tonight:  green curry with chicken with a good spiciness--probably a 5 or 6 out of 10 at most Thai restaurants; black bean Asian eggplant with tofu; and some bamboo mahi mahi--the fish being tasty and juicy for a buffet setting.  Disappointments were the teriyaki chicken (too sweet) and the artisan breads.  The breads have never been outstanding, but they seem to be closer to regular sliced bread than artisan.\u000a\u000aDesserts as always were good.  I think the cannoli are the best of any buffet in town.  I wasn't fond of the pecan pie, but the creme brulee is outstanding.  \u000a\u000aService was top notch.  The server brought fresh glasses of iced tea before I was finished with one, and he brought coffee with dessert.  50% off for people 50 and older on Wednesday makes this a super value.

VReview for casino only:\u000a\u000aFirst, parking in the east garage is very convenient to the entrance and the buffet.\u000a\u000aThe casino has wide aisles and is laid out nicely.  There is a good mix of machines.\u000a\u000aSince this is on the other side of town, I'm not a regular her, but it is a very  nice property.

VWe stopped here for breakfast yesterday.  It's a standard Denny's.  Service was good, my Southwest skillet was good, the coffee was off.  It was strong and bitter.  I like strong but not the bitter.\u000a\u000aThe location was a Coco's for several years before becoming a Denny's.  Besides being America's diner, I think they are America's senior dining spot.  The music is definitely 60s which I like.\u000a\u000aI will be back to Denny's from time to time, but they seem stuck in their rut although they're always trying with new foods and other items.  The place is OK.

VI've been here for two mini-shows with the performers at the front of their small stage in front of the piano.  Both times I sat at the bar with my diet Coke.\u000a\u000aI like the place, but since I'm not a drinker, I can't rate the place like others can.  It's a fine venue for the reason I've been there, but it's not a destination place for me.

VI just got home from seeing the show tonight (1/22/2010). I really love this show.  There were a few glitches (minor).  The music was fantastic.  I love the way the women blended with Elvis' voice.  \u000a\u000aMy favorite numbers were Love Me Tender, Jailhouse Rock, and Viva Las Vegas.  All of it is wonderful, and the finale was quite good.  Most of the audience rose at the end for a standing ovation, including me, and I'm not a standing ovation kind of person.\u000a\u000aI have seen all the Cirque shows in Las Vegas and most of them  multiple times.  This is a unique addition to their lineup.  I will be back to see this again in a few months.\u000a\u000aViva Las Vegas and Viva Elvis!!!!\u000a\u000aEdit:  I need to add that there are less acrobatics in this show than the other Cirque shows.  There is a good amount of dance, and there are some acrobatics when going with the music or in enriching the understanding of Elvis' life, although I'm afraid some people won't get some of the acrobatic work, especially near the beginning.

VOK, so I saw this show again on July 12th.  What can I say?  The show is very good, it has great music, it's a fine tribute to Elvis, and there are some good acrobatics in the show, too!  \u000a\u000aI saw the show with a group of Yelpies.  Since I was the most senior Yelpie there who lived and remembers the years when Elvis was performing, I was anxious to gauge the group's reaction to different segments of the show.\u000a\u000aMost appeared to like what I do, but perhaps with a bit less enthusiasm than me.  Sure this isn't your traditional Cirque show, but what is?  Every Cirque show, and I've seen them all more than once (well I'd never put myself though Believe a second time), is different.  Each has its own blend of dance, music, and acrobatics.  As Cirque has matured in Las Vegas, it has placed a bit less emphasis on the circus like part of Cirque to the artistic, musical, dance part of Cirque.  That's neither good nor bad--it's change.\u000a\u000aThe one lame part of this show is the aerial pas de deux used as a scene changer.  I have thought this was out of place from show one, but if they leave it in, that's OK too.\u000a\u000aAny time you have a group of performers dressed smartly and signing Viva Las Vegas, you've got me hooked.

VI went here for lunch with a friend from Chicago after the backstage tour of Jubilee!  Everything was very good.  We shared a Margherita pizza with sun dried tomatoes and Italian sausage, and we each had a Frozen Hot Chocolate for dessert.  \u000a\u000aThe place was quite busy, and our 25 minute wait promised when I left my name with the hostess turned into a 10 minute wait.  We were seated indoors on the 100+ degree day.  It was quite a fun place.\u000a\u000aI want to come back and try one of their salads and maybe their deep fried Oreo cookie sundae.

VI got a chance to do this adventure two years ago.  It was a hoot.  I went with three people from Wisconsin who were enjoying Las Vegas and it was fun being the only local on the adventure.\u000a\u000aOur driver, Max, took us to several store front in a nearby shopping plaza where we found clues and collected things that earned us prizes at the end.  Sometimes it entailed crawling on the floor to look at bottom shelves.  Other times, we had to be alert to find hidden doors and secret passages.\u000a\u000aThe staging was cleverly done!  We were on the adventure for 2 1/2 hours.  When the evening was over, we are agreed about how much fun we had.  I also felt like I got to be friends with the out of towners.\u000a\u000aIf you can get a Groupon or a discounted ticket at one of the Tix4Tonite booths, don't pass this up.  It's very enjoyable.

VI stopped here to get a gift card for a friend.  They had them at the register, were quick to get one for me, and I was on my way in a short time.  Now, I have to go back to 168 and check out their goods as my friend really enjoys shopping there.  I'll update my review after that visit.

VAfter my thrilling airplane ride with the nearby Sky Combat Aces, I stopped at the Henderson Executive Terminal to treat myself to breakfast at the Landings, the second floor restaurant in the terminal.\u000a\u000aI walked up the stairs, turned left, and there it was a few steps in front of me.  It was about 11 AM, and it was not at all busy.  The waitress told me to sit anywhere I wanted and since the patio was open, I went outside and sat there.\u000a\u000aThe menu is extensive for breakfast.  I opted for the day's special, Eggs Benedict.  You have a choice of home fries or hash browns.  I opted for the home fries.\u000a\u000aCoffee was brought soon after I sat down and I was asked if I wanted something to drink.  It was refilled quickly, too!\u000a\u000aThe Benedict was good except the eggs were a bit on the hard cooked side rather than soft cooked.  The Hollandaise was probably purchased rather than made on premises, but it had a good flavor.\u000a\u000aService was excellent!  Denise was my server and she was a cheerful server who was very capable.  \u000a\u000aSitting outside and having breakfast with a view of Las Vegas to my left and the Henderson Executive Airport and the McCullough Range straight ahead made a great breakfast stop!

VI had a Groupon for Bally's Steakhouse and decided to use it last night before going to a play at UNLV.  It was a very good dining experience.\u000a\u000aI was brought the bread basket shortly after getting my iced tea delivered.  The selection was nice.  I only had one multi-grain roll because I wasn't there to fill up on bread.\u000a\u000aFor starters, I got the onion soup.  It was a hearty beef stock with just the right amount of cheese on top.  I didn't have to have to break my way through a cheese avalanche to get to the soup.\u000a\u000aFor the main course, I got the 12 ounce filet and I had them Oscar it.  That adds lump crabmeat and asparagus to the steak.  When served, the waiter brought a small sauce boat of Bérnaise that he ladled over the crab.  There was a small grilled whole tomato and a yellow pepper on the plate.  I got a twice baked potato as a side.  The steak was cooked black and blue as I ordered and it had a good flavor.\u000a\u000aLast, dessert.  I ordered their signature banana cream pie.  It was very good.  Instead of a graham cracker crust, they used chopped peanuts for the crust and there are a few peanuts dropped onto the whipped cream that topped the pie.  \u000a\u000aService was good.  Iced tea was refilled without asking.  My one test of service was a fail.  After I out the artificial sweetener in my iced tea, I always twist the small paper packet and leave it on the table.  Good service always notices this and removes the empty packet.  Last night, the packet was left there three times.  It's an obvious thing to remove it but they just didn't.\u000a\u000aI enjoyed the hour and a half I spent here.  I wasn't rushed, the food was good, and it's a classic steakhouse with striped wall paper, wood railings, and brass lights.  Dark and cozy is also a good description.  It got quite noisy when two large groups came in, but once they started getting some food, they quieted down.

VMeeting friends here for dinner tonight, two had blintzes, one had the veal shank special, and I had the Cuban sandwich.  I haven't been here in over a year and nothing has changed--including the menu.  \u000a\u000aMy Cuban sandwich was good, and it came with fries (my choice).  Service was good and I really have no complaints.  There's simply nothing compelling about eating here that makes me think, "Hey, I think I'll go to the Rampart and eat at the Promenade Café.

VI have eaten in once and I had take out again tonight - about the 6th time I've had Thai food from here.  It is wonderful!  I really like the place, but since it's so close to my house and my wife doesn't do Thai, I get her Chinese on West Charleston and then bop over here to get my dinner for home.\u000a\u000aI have been through all of their curries.  I usually get an 8 spiciness and I could go higher.  Next time, I'll do 9 for a try.\u000a\u000aI really enjoyed the one time I ate in.  The restaurant is very nice.

VI had read the good reviews on Yelp but I'm rarely in the area except to pass through.  Yesterday, I stopped for breakfast one block away and I decided to get some pastries to bring home.\u000a\u000aI got something that would stay in the car while I was biking and hiking.  There was so much to choose from.  I got a bag of Christmas butter cookies and a poppy seed strudel.  Poppy seed rolls was one thing my mother-in-law always served at Christmas so this was an easy pick,\u000a\u000aThe cookies are great and the strudel is very good.  The pastry around the poppy seed is so tasty and it just cracks away.  My wife thinks it's too sweet.  I think it's very good.\u000a\u000aI will make a point to make the detour here another time.  I need to try some more of their goodies!

VI like Crystals a lot as a place to go to see high end stores with few shoppers.  I like the layout and the attention to design that was put into building this place.\u000a\u000aIt is, however, not a place I would go to shop.  I like it for the exhibits they periodically have and for just looking at the few people one generally sees there.\u000a\u000aPerhaps when the economy comes back, the place will have more zing.  Still, I like the space and I hope it does well!

VI was at Parma once before to enjoy one of Nelson Q.'s UYE with Chef Marc.  This time my wife and I came after a dance program for an early dinner.  In fact, we arrived just before 5 PM as they were setting things up for the evening's dinner service.  Tracy, our server, seated us and then went to get menus, dishes, and silverware.  While he was gone, Chef Marc came over and discussed the offerings for the night's menu.\u000a\u000aBy the time Tracy came back with the menus, I already knew what I was having but my wife needed time to decide.  We ordered a house salad to share.  The salad had an oil and vinegar dressing and it had a dollop of fresh ricotta to enjoy. I got the salmon special which was a beautiful piece of salmon seasoned beautifully and cooked perfectly.  The salmon was on a bed of garlic spinach and some homemade pappardelle dyed with cuttlefish ink.  Excellent pasta, too.  My wife got chicken marsala that came with a side of rigatoni with red sauce.  She enjoyed it and I tasted the sauce and it was quite flavorful\u000a\u000aFor desert, I asked Tracy about the size of the chocolate mousse cake and he said it was large and easily shared.  I was somewhat crestfallen because I wanted to enjoy one of the wonderful cannoli I had when I was here for the UYE.  I told Tracy I'd order some cannoli to take home if the cake didn't fill me up.  When he brought our cake, there was one of their small versions of cannoli as a complimentary treat--proof that you can have your cake and cannoli, too!  It was very much appreciated!\u000a\u000aTracy was an excellent server.  Chef Marc is passionate about his food and he's a joy to talk to.  I'm looking forward to our next UYE here so I can have another of his 5 course special meals he designs for the Yelp group.

VMy sweet tooth was acting up today and I decided to stop at Sugars.  It's about a mile from home - almost too convenient.  I got two cupcakes, the Red Velvet and the Carrot cake.  The icing ratio on the Red Velvet was fine, and the icing was tasty.  \u000a\u000aOn the other hand, the Carrot cake with cream cheese frosting and filling was quite sweet.  Mind you, my sweet tooth didn't care, but it could have been toned down a bit.  The cream cheese filling was so heavy the cupcake was split in half and I couldn't pick it up without it breaking into two pieces.\u000a\u000aThe cupcakes were baked correctly and they were moist.  Except for the filling of the carrot cake cupcake, everything was fine. I think they're a bit pricey at $2.50 each for a rather small cupcake.  I won't be here often, but maybe now and then for a fix will be fine.

VI used to stop at the Roma Deli on Spring Mountain Road but I was usually going west and getting across the lanes there was a pain depending on the time of day.  Then Roma Deli II opened not far from home and wow, I never stopped in the years it's been there.\u000a\u000aI needed some good grated cheese for something I was making and decided the time was right.  I stopped in yesterday and got a pound of pecorino romano.  I also got a block of romano for snacking on while watching TV.  The cheese is excellent.  Very flavorful and with that great salty cheese taste.\u000a\u000aI was disappointed in the selection.  The deli area is much smaller than the original.  I was hoping I could get some peppers stuffed with prosciutto wrapped cheese.  Not at this location.  I guess I need to try another Italian deli and see if I can find a better selection.

VI was on my way home a little after midnight and I wanted a cold drink.  This McDonald's is easy to get to.  The drive through had three cars in front of me but before long, I had my diet Coke ordered and I was soon at the window picking it up.\u000a\u000aI generally don't stop in this neighborhood because there are others closer to home, but this was perfect last night.  A good stop with a pleasant and quick staff.

VI have been wanting to see this show for some time.  This would be the final act in seeing all the topless shows in Las Vegas.  Finishing this task, though a chore, would be my crowning achievement.  Enter a friend who offered to give me two tickets!  Yes, the price is right and I'm set to go.  My wife is not a late show person, so I met a fellow Yelpie, Tony T, at the Peepshow Theatre at Planet Hollywood last night.\u000a\u000aI was not disappointed.  The premise of the show is a bit weak.  I guess with a show like this, I really didn't plan on going for the story line, so this wasn't too much of a drawback.  Holly Madison is gorgeous.  Her role is limited to brief appearances to move the story along.  In the last scene, we get to see the real Madison and it's worth the wait. \u000a\u000aThe music is quite good.  There are some very good singers on that stage.  The "Feelin' Good" number is very well done!  The scene with Timber is excellent.  His strength is amazing.  \u000a\u000aFinally, the one scene that was the best for the night was the giant milk bath.  The three ladies in the vat were quite good.  This part of the show was quite clever and it was staged beautifully.  It brought a big smile to my face.  Got milk?\u000a\u000aI'd go again to see this show.  The ladies are quite pretty and the vibe of the place is so Las Vegas.\u000a\u000aEdit:  After reading Tony T's review, I remembered I wanted to mention being totally blinded near the beginning of the show when the dancers stand in front of a huge Peepshow lighted display that is so bright you are literally blinded for a second.  Then the dancers become dark figures in the bright light.

VI had dinner here tonight.  It was my first visit.  I had the Lamb Saag and an order of Garlic Naan.  I really enjoyed my meal.  I asked for it to be spicy.  It was a little mild for me, but it was still very good.  I'll be back to try the lunch buffet to get a mix of their food.

VThis is another great restaurant in Aria.  I have been wanting to try this for two years and I finally went tonight.  I got the 5 course Signature Tasting Menu and it was great excellent!!\u000a\u000aThe bread basket had a pretzel roll, lavosh, and two pieces of Bon Breads batards.  Nice basket selection.\u000a\u000aCoure 1 - Almas Ara Caviar served on a bed of lemon gelée with some crème fraiche and a sprig of dill.  The gelée filled a hollowed out lemon and the caviar and other things were placed on top of the gelée,\u000a\u000aCoure 2 - Bacon wrapped shrimp with papaya mustard and cilantro.  \u000a\u000aCourse 3 - Chilean Sea Bass with a miso foam with Yuzu.  \u000a\u000aCourse 4 - 6 ounce Wagyu filet served on a small bed of spinach and with two rounds of parmesan squash.\u000a\u000aCourse 5 - Desert was the JG Candy bar.  The candy bar was a mixture of chocolate crunch with caramel peanuts, some candied popcorn, peanut butter, white chocolate, and an oval of whipped cream.\u000a\u000aComments:  I was impressed by the flavor profiles developed in each of the dishes.  The mixture of lemon, dill and caviar was unique and very fresh tasting.  The bacon gave the shrimp and amazing taste and the papaya mustard added an additional layer of flavor.  The spiciness of the foam with the sea bass was another wonderful flavor pairing.  The Wagyu beef was so tender it almost fell apart on its own yet it was cooked black and blue as I asked.  Finally the candy bar had so many flavors and textures and it was really a playful finishing course for this grand meal.\u000a\u000aI did not get the dipping sauces with my steak, but I didn't request them and I didn't care if I had them or not.  I'm normally a steak purist and like steak as it is without anything but salt.\u000a\u000aThe staff was amazing.  I was served by Team 1.  I had prompt, always attentive service without being annoying.  My iced tea glass was not refilled.  When I neared the end of a glass, a server came by with a fresh glass of iced tea and took the old one.  I didn't need to request a refill--it was just done.  The main server always returned after I had a short time with each course to check if everything was satisfactory.  This is amazing service and the team concept worked just the way they planned.\u000a\u000aI liked the room a lot.  It's modern, dimly lit but with small spot lights that light each table so you have a super combination of dim lighting but enough light I didn't need the flash when I took my photos.  I also liked the fact that the bar area with its TV was segregated from the dining areas by a sheer curtain that blocked the bar atmosphere which is just fine with me.\u000a\u000a** Begin Rant:  Guys, this is not a restaurant to wear t-shirts even if they are for Azuza Pacific U.  Dress up a little, please!  And for two other guys, wearing a ball cap at any restaurant during dinner is NEVER correct.  Show some class.  John Deere no less.  ** End Rant.\u000a\u000aJean Georges is a restaurant to which I'll return.  Truly 5 stars!

VI went to Sirio earlier this week and was very pleased with the meal.  I had reservations and I was asked if I wanted to eat in their café area or the more formal dining room.  I chose the dining room, and I'm glad I did because I really liked the room.\u000a\u000aMy server brought the menu, noted the specials of the day, then went to the à la carte selections, and finally showed me the two tasting menus on the last page.  He recommended the 4 course if I wanted a tasting menu as there were choices for each course.  I opted for no choice--the 5 course selection--because I liked the different things that were offered, choice or no choice.\u000a\u000aThey brought out some bread--normal Italian bread and Focaccia.  The waiter poured the EVOO into a small dish and then added balsamic vinegar.  Several times during the meal I was asked if I wanted more.  They were very attentive.\u000a\u000aDescriptions are from Sirio's online menu:\u000a\u000aCourse 1:  Appetizer--Crispy langoustine tails in Kataifi crust, white balsamic syrup, and sweet pea-mint sauce.  The langoustine was excellent and the pea-mint sauce was very tasty.  The stringy top was a bit difficult to eat and I had much of it on my placemat.  You just can't take me anywhere.\u000a\u000aCourse 2:  Pasta--Asparagus ravioli, parmesan sauce, early summer truffles.  The server put extra grated cheese on my dish as desired.  The ravioli was excellent and the parmesan sauce was delicious.\u000a\u000aCourse 3: Fish Entrée--Roasted halibut fillet with spotted prawn, sautéed fava beans and morel mushrooms, and sweet onion purée.  Another winner.  My server asked me if I wanted parmesan on this, and I had some sprinkled on.  The fava beans and the morels just gave the dish an extra flavor and texture that made everything stand out.\u000a\u000aCourse 4:  Meat Entrée--Roasted Wagyu beef flat iron steak stuffed with Swiss chard and spinach, roasted new potatoes, garlic demi glacé.  Excellent!  The beef was superb and the Swiss chard added a nice flavor.\u000a\u000aCourse 5:  Dessert--Sautéed balsamic strawberries, lemon Zeppole and pistachio gelato.  There were some glazed walnut pieces and some extra chopped pistachios sprinkled on the strawberries.  This was excellent, too!\u000a\u000aService was top notch from the time I walked in until I left.  Someone was always stopping by to see if everything was OK or if I wanted something without being bothersome.  Fresh iced tea glasses were brought and the almost empty ones whisked away.\u000a\u000aThe one server took me to see the private dining room you can book for a group dinner.  It's a beautiful room.  Now, if I can only get Yelp to host a dinner there, we're set!\u000a\u000aOverall, this was an excellent choice and a very good, memorable meal.

VI went to American Fish tonight for their pre-theatre prix fixe menu.  It was one of the best meals I have had here.  Everything about dinner was simply amazing!\u000a\u000aIt started with the service.  I had a 5 PM reservation.  The hostess asked me if I was going to the Elvis show.  When I explained I had a show at an art gallery and after would be going to Las Vegas Little Theatre for a play, she seemed interested but I took that as just being welcoming.  In fact, she relayed my plans to my waiter without me knowing.  After ordering, he mentioned that he was aware that I had a few places to go, and did I want them to keep an eye on the clock for me so I didn't have to be concerned.  Score many service points there.\u000a\u000aTaking my order, the waiter answered the questions I had, and when I asked for his opinions on some things I was contemplating ordering, he was professional, friendly, and thorough.  More service points.\u000a\u000aAfter ordering, while the restaurant was still quiet, my waiter escorted me to the glass windows that separate the kitchen from the dining room and explained the four cooking areas and the kinds of cooking sone in each--sea salt baked, open grill, pan searing, and sous-vide.  He also explained their use of apricot would for fuel and taste addition to the food.  Score many more points here.  I must mention what fun I had watching the chefs work behind the glass.  It was quite a show.  I also have a long explanation as to why they use apricot wood.\u000a\u000aI started with Michael Mina's signature first course of Tuna Tartare on a small bed of arugula with pine nuts and a quail egg.  It was excellent.  The bread had been brought out by now, and I had two pieces of grill toasted ciabatta and one corn muffin.  Along with the bread was a small plate with butter and a container of garlic and rosemary flavored olive oil.  Wow, was everything good!\u000a\u000aThe main course was sea salt-baked Branzino with a few green beans, crispy fried polenta, some minted peas, and some pearl onions.  The fish and the accompaniments continued the winning streak of the meal.  Everything was superb!\u000a\u000aThe dessert course was Valrhona chocolate custard with red velvet cake, sweetened pecans, and some cocoa nib ice cream.  The custard was so smooth and delightful.  It was heavenly!\u000a\u000aEverything about tonight's meal was excellent - the service, the food, and the room.  I really enjoyed this experience so very much.  I will be coming back.  And, I had lots of time to get to the art gallery near the Mandarin Oriental and to Las Vegas Little Theatre for the play.  A super night!

VAugust C and I met for dinner here last night, and we had a thoroughly enjoyable meal.  We each ordered the four course Chef's Signature menu.  Sage is in the Aria Hotel and Casino in City Center at the end of the entrance near the registration area for the hotel.\u000a\u000aWe started with an amuse-bouche.  I have forgotten the ingredients but it was a good way to get us ready for our fine meal. \u000a\u000aFor the first course, we got the same thing - Wagyu Beef Tartare prepared with crushed caper aioli, a poached egg, and some crispy chocolate pieces like small potato chip slices with a chocolate flavor.  The texture of the Wagyu was excellent.  The starter came with bread pieces to eat with the Waygu or spread the Wagyu on.  Very interesting and tasty dish.\u000a\u000aFor the second course, we each got the Lobster ravioli.  It had a lemon and olive puree, some corn pieces, mascarpone, and fresh mint.  This course was very tasty.  The mint gave the dish a good counterpoint to the olive oil and lemon puree.\u000a\u000aFor the third course, I got the Iberico pork loin done with bacon, braised shoulder cannelloni, and tomato.  August got the Snake River Farms New York steak strip with marrow, potatoes and fried Maitake mushrooms.  We enjoyed our respective main courses.  \u000a\u000aFor the last course, August got the Sweet Corn Panna Cotta and I got the Chocolate S'mores.  The panna cotta had marinated apricot, caramel Ice Cream, and a popcorn tuile.  My S'mores consisted of a milk chocolate brownie, some smoked marshmallow laid out lengthwise over the brownie, a a Greek yogurt sorbet.  There was a piece of graham cracker cookie next to the brownie/marshmallow piece and some chocolate swirls.   It was very tasty, but I thought it could use a little bit more marshmallow.\u000a\u000aDinner ended with a small cup of hot chocolate with a shot of espresso.  A super way to end a good meal.\u000a\u000aService was excellent.  The restaurant is quite beautiful.  This is a place to which I would return.  It was a nice dinner and lots of pleasant conversation.  This will also teach our wives a lesson or two about leaving us in Las Vegas while they're off visiting family.

VAlmost two years after my first visit to Sage, I made a return visit to have the Iron Chef America menu that Chef Shawn McClain's made and served the judges on last week's (9/5/12) Iron Chef America.  Chef McClain challenged Iron Chef Forgione and McClain won handily.  They are serving the menu this week only at Sage--tomorrow being the last day.  I really like this restaurant--the food, the décor, and the general ambiance.  Onto the meal.\u000a\u000aI'm glad Chef McClain does not shy away from salt.  There's soft butter served with a small container of sea salt.  Several of the dishes had a salt flavor that enhanced the food.  My server and I spoke about this for a bit and he agreed with me about using salt. \u000a\u000aCourse 1: Dinner started with whelk toast with a tropical sangrita.  The sangrita was flavored with padron pepper. ginger, and lime.  There was a nice kick from the padron pepper.  Very refreshing beginning.  The whelk toast was very good.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog#E6mV80XbGYsn1m4UlhTzjg\u000a\u000aCourse 2:  This was sashimi of Hawaiian nairagi.  The nairagi was in small roll like curves and had some sea salt crystals on the outside.  The sashimi was on coconut purée with shaved hearts of palm, and togarashi cured pineapple.  The pepper flavor with the coconut and pineapple was fantastic!  \u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog#HaXdWtg8SkxXD1ewW5REjA\u000a\u000aCourse 3:  Whelk ceviche with green zebra tomatoes, avocado espuma, and green mango.  What a complex mix of flavors.  Everything went well together and the whelk and tomatoes were wonderful!\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog#SizPEw_4IWsPxinOsrf02Q\u000a\u000aCourse 4:  Lemongrass coconut soup.  There was a tempura fried prawn on the soup, the "noodles" were made of young coconut, and it was given an extra flavor kick with Thai basil.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog#kZjlT7E5fkJuDLo-nGK_-g\u000a\u000aCourse 5:  Braised pork belly.  This was served with sweet coconut rice, thin slices Iberico ham with glazed pineapple.  There was a peppery flavor to the pork belly and it was such a great counterpoint to the pineapple's sweetness.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog#EVSglQBj0DdpcRCVHaofMQ\u000a\u000aDessert:  Creamy white chocolate with coconut.  This was a white chocolate soup.  The white chocolate was in a small pitcher and the server poured the liquid chocolate over the rum-compressed pineapple and sweet tapioca that were in the bowl.  There was also a serving of mango sorbet.  The tapioca was cooked to perfection, the white chocolate was addicting and the pineapple was great!\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog#FXHKG6FMdEU6pvNAjeLJ_Q\u000a\u000aLastly, at the end of meals at Sage, the server brings a small container of hot chocolate that has both banana and caramel mixed in.  What a delightful reverse amuse-blouche with which to end your meal.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog#yPSJUmfus3MsIpUvR9TYpg\u000a\u000aService was exemplary as I knew it would be.  When my iced tea glass was low, a server brought me another glass.  No asking, no waiting--just excellent service.  My head server was James and we chatted about the contest and how everyone had kept the results secret for almost a year since the show was taped.  James was excellent!  I hope he's working when I'm there again.  What a treat to live in a city to have such fine chefs as Shawn McClain!\u000a\u000aAnother pleasant meal at Sage.  And, I will be back for another one--soon I hope.

VI was at the Aria buffet in its first incarnation and I liked it a lot.  I was surprised when some trashed it so much, so I was glad when MGM Resorts announced they were closing the buffet and re-doing it.  Yesterday I had the chance to try it since the redo.\u000a\u000aIt's basically the same place with a few modest changes and perhaps the addition of a few stations.  First the good--the prime rib was cooked nicely with it being a nice red rare.  The vegetable korma in the Tandoori section was quite good.  The chicken tikka masala was OK, but it needed more spice.  The seafood gumbo was quite nice.  I wish I had noticed the basmati rice in the tandoori section first.  I would have put some rice in the bowl and then added the gumbo.  The cheese bar was very nice with some dried fruit with the cheese.  The desserts were outstanding!!\u000a\u000aA few lesser dishes.  The bao sandwich was not good at all.  The lovely steamed roll had dried hard from sitting warming for however long it was there.  The pork in the bun was kind of bland making this a fail choice.  There were some different bread selections but not a wide range to choose from.  The chicken satay was merely OK.  The peanut sauce was way too runny and didn't have a lot of flavor.  When you're paying $36.74 for dinner buffet, the shrimp should be PEELED.  I didn't have any because this is an onerous task for me.\u000a\u000aNow the desserts.  While there was nothing exotic or earth shaking, they had some very nice small desserts.  I'm a sucker for meringue cookies and they had a fruit flavored one.  It was delightful!  I also had two of their mini whoopie cookies--one a snowball (chocolate cake with coconut) and one made from red velvet.  The cream filling was very good.  The gelato selection is good and I had the Oreo gelato.  Nice and creamy.\u000a\u000aThis isn't a buffet to which I'd likely return.  For the price, there are better buffets on the Strip with some very good selections.  Also for the price, I think I'd pay a little more and eat at one of Aria's fine selection of restaurants!

VReview is for Spring Restaurant Week 2012 menu:\u000a\u000aCourse 1:  Chicken satay with peanut sauce and cucumber salad.  The chicken was good, but I thought the peanut sauce could have been richer.  \u000a\u000aCourse 2:  Tom Yum mushroom soup.  Very flavorful and very spicy just the way I ordered.  I almost made myself cry!\u000a\u000aCourse 3:  Pad Thai Ghoong.  Stir fried rice noodles with prawns, bean sprouts, and and a small mound of chopped peanuts.  Very good Pad Thai.  \u000a\u000aCourse 4:  Bua Loi:  This is a dessert of warm, sweetened coconut soup with small rice flour dumplings.  Very, very good and a reason to go back for dessert alone.\u000a\u000aI really like the decor of Lemongrass.  The food was excellent--4 star quality.  I dropped the rating down 1 star because of service.  The meal was rushed.  When I was merely halfway through my soup, the server brought my Pad Thai.  Later, before I finished that main course, the server brought my dessert and when putting it down said, "What good timing!  You're almost done."\u000a\u000aNo, it wasn't good timing.  There should be some time between courses.  It wasn't just me.  I saw an adjoining table where their main courses were brought before they were half done with their soup.  Also, the presentation of the soup with a sloppy spill isn't what I'd expect from a restaurant in Aria.  \u000a\u000aI would come back for dessert alone.  The Bua Loi is fantastic.  Look for a photo someone has posted and you can see the small dumplings.

VThe Comedy Club now bills itself as "Sandy Hackett presents the Riviera COmedy Club."  I went last night and Hackett started the comedy after having just finished his 1st floor gig with the Rat Pack Show he runs.\u000a\u000aThis club closed for a short time, but is now up and running again.  Judging by the turnout last night and the talent of the comedians, the club should be OK as long as tourist numbers keep rising.\u000a\u000aI'll go back and see another show.  It was quite good!  And last night was only the 3rd night since the club was reopened.

V*** Review is for Spring Restaurant Week 2014 menu ***\u000a\u000aThis was a late addition to my Restaurant Week lineup.  I'm so glad I made the change.  I was warmly greeted at reception and asked to wait until one of the people who seat you arrived.  A short time later, I was taken to my table through what appeared to be a maze of small hallways and dining spaces.  I was seated at a table in a section near the bar that was L shaped.\u000a\u000aSoon, the server, Carmen, arrived and she asked me about drinks.  I ordered an iced tea and that was brought quickly with a small container of simple syrup.  I had studied the menu online and I knew what I wanted except for the main course.  I asked Carmen for her advice.\u000a\u000aFor the first course, I went with the stir fried spicy quail with fresh lily bulb.  The dish was prepared with Chinese 5 spice and chili sauce.  It had a really nice tang but it was not overpowering, just very good!  There were two legs and 2 wings--a very ample serving for a starter.\u000a\u000aFor the main course, I went with the stir fried venison with spicy yellow bean sauce.  There were three thin slices of venison in a great spicy sauce.  With the venison, I was served two sides--a small container of fried pak choi with garlic and a small bowl of vegetable fried rice.  Carmen brought me a knife and fork for this course knowing it would be easier to deal with the meat.  I had requested wooden chopsticks (they don't have them) because I am very poor at using plastic chopsticks.  Things slip off plastic chopsticks very easily even when I'm just looking at them.  I'll have to bring in my own wooden ones or my screw together metal chopsticks that were a gift.  Again, the dish was spicy but it was not overpowering spicy.  It was quite enjoyable.\u000a\u000aThere is no choice for dessert.  You get a passion fruit panna cotta with, as the menu says, citrus supremes, guava gelato, and blood orange sorbet.  Carmen had me listen to a crackling sound when she first brought the dessert.  She wouldn't tell me what it was but said I should try it and we'd talk about it when I was done.  I had two things in mind for what it was.  I was correct with the second idea.  They put some pop rocks on the panna cotta to make a bit of a texture play.  The panna cotta was very good.\u000a\u000aTo sum up, the food really is the "dog's bollocks!" (Thanks R).  Portion size was just right and they downsized the sides because I was dining alone.  The room is delightful--not one large room but made up of many smaller areas.  The restaurant really isn't all they big in the great scheme of things.  Service was excellent.\u000a\u000aBefore bringing the bill, Carmen brought me a coupon good for $50 on my next visit as long as it's used before April 10.  She said, "It's like having your dinner tonight for $.14."  I will be back and use the coupon.  I have to do the sea bass which she said was their most popular dish and is excellent.  \u000a\u000aOne short aside:  I can hike in the desert where there's no trail.  Leaving last night without an escort, I ended up almost in the kitchen.  Then I realized I had almost made a complete trek around the outside ring of the place.  I did make it to the door and was somewhat embarrassed getting lost in the small space.  It's a like a maze!\u000a\u000aI'm glad that Restaurant Week gives me the chance to try some new places that I normally wouldn't.

VI really like this buffet, but I don't take advantage of their offerings to get the most out of it.  There's a baked potato area with lots of fixings so you can make your own loaded potato.  I generally don't eat potatoes, so I've passed on this each time although I salivate when going by.\u000a\u000aThe Italian area has a cook to order section with ingredients such as shrimp, spinach, mushrooms, onions, peppers, etc.  I generally don't eat pasta, so I pass on this, too!  See a trend!\u000a\u000aI do eat their loin of pork, the pepper chicken in the Asian section was great yesterday, and the pot stickers were good.  They have pork nuggets so you can put on your own sweet and sour sauce or Orange sauce which are in containers.\u000a\u000aThe one disappointment was they didn't have these melt away confectioner sugar coated cookies yesterday.  I really love those little critters.  There's nothing to them, and they almost melt in your mouth.  It's such a simple little cookie, but a dessert I look forward to getting.  They didn't have any yesterday!\u000a\u000aI'll return.  One of these days one of the bakers is going to be mine!

VI wanted a light dinner so I went to China One and got some Corn egg drop soup.  It was quite a lot--a portion two people could easily share.\u000a\u000aI did take out and of course they were quick as the soup is one of the standards that are always ready.\u000a\u000aI'll be back to try some of their entrées, perhaps even try one of the lunch specials that my fellow Yelpers recommend.

VI saw Lion King for the 2nd time in Las Vegas tonight.  It was a KNPR benefit and the seat was good at a great price--all to benefit KNPR.  \u000a\u000aI remember being wowed by this show when I first saw it on Broadway.  I am delighted that the Las Vegas production is the same as the original without being dumbed down for visitors who need to get back to the tables or to their drinking.  Having an intermission is such a great theatre tradition and intact for this show.\u000a\u000aThe costumes, acting, singing, and musicians are fantastic.  The placement of some percussion players on both side walls gave a stereo affect several times.\u000a\u000aI didn't give the show 5 stars because I think there are sections that could be tightened up to move the story along.  This is a problem with the script, not the Las Vegas production.\u000a\u000aI'll see the show again before it ends its Las Vegas run.

VTropical Smoothie Café has some tasty smoothies.  I especially like their Sunrise Sunset smoothie which is quite refreshing!  Made with Splenda, the calories are limited and make the drink a nice treat.\u000a\u000aI've stopped here before to get a wrap and a salad and the staff was efficient and friendly.  Since there's are two TS outlets nearer to my home, this outlet would be my pick if I wanted to stop for a late night smoothie.

VI stopped here on the way home from a lecture at UNLV and I'm glad I did.  They are nearing the end of a promotion with some special flavors, and I was really pleased with the choices available.\u000a\u000aI had some toasted coconut which was OK.  The best one was the black sesame vanilla which they say is from Japan.  The flavors available represent many countries around the world and I need to get back before the promotion ends.\u000a\u000aThe shop was very clean, there was plenty of seating, and the staff was quick and polite.  Parking this evening was great!  I am a fan!

VI had a great meal here tonight.  My rating would have been 5 stars if the dishes had not come out almost concurrently.  Next time, I'll order one tapas at a time and have more time to enjoy the experience.\u000a\u000aI had the bacon wrapped dates, the veggie empanadas, and the chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms.  For dessert, I splurged ands went with the dessert platter.  Wow.  Great!\u000a\u000aI'll be back.

VA couple of Yelp friends recommended this place and then a Groupon popped up one day.  Bingo!  The Groupon was expiring soon, so I went tonight.  I'm so glad I did!\u000a\u000aFor a starter, I got a small (8 oz.) clam chowder which is done New England style.  It was excellent and it was served mouth burning hot!!  I had a bottle of hot sauce on my table I'd asked for.  The cook asked me how I liked his chowder (Joe, perhaps?) and he asked if I used the hot sauce in the chowder.  I had not, but i saved enough to give the chowder a good shot of the hot sauce.  It is great!  Next time - hot sauce in the chowder from the get go!\u000a\u000aI had the large (12) fried clams.  With it I got the seasoned fries (included with the meal) and cole slaw.  Two hush puppies come with this meal, too!  I got a small iced tea.  Refills allowed. \u000a\u000aYou order at a counter and then the staff brings your food to you.  The seasoned fries were very good.  I found myself using hot sauce more than the tartar sauce for my clams.  I agree with Candace that there's too much mayo and not enough acidity to balance the mayo.\u000a\u000aThis is a nice place to stop for a different dinner.  I'm not sure I'd make the trip there often, but it's a good alternative.\u000a\u000aNote on the photo of the soup.  All I had was my iPhone and I was too close.  It's way better than photo would indicate!

VI left the Hilton late last night and I was really thirsty.  This was an easy in/out option for me from Sahara.  I did the drive through and was on my way with a Diet Coke in about 2 minutes.\u000a\u000aThis is one of the remaining early style McDonald's outlets and there's a classic Chevrolet parallel to the drive through where you can take photos.\u000a\u000aLooking through the windows, I could see the interior is also the classic design.  I'll have to go back and sit inside.  Do I see a Shamrock shake in my near future?

VI went to U-Swirl last night to use a couponI had.  I had a mixture of red velvet and pumpkin (I know, the flavors don't work together, but I kept them separated pretty well in the cup).  What didn't taste as good were the blueberries on the red velvet.  That was an error.\u000a\u000aI was pleased with my selection and with the service.  The ambiance is OK.  With the cold temperatures, it wasn't a night for enjoying sitting on the patio, so I got into one of their barstools and sat at a high table.\u000a\u000aIt was very quiet.  Two women finished their purchase and took their yogurt to go.  A father and daughter came in later.  I left while they were still filling their cups.\u000a\u000aThere was a nice selection of flavors, two of which were sugar free if that's important for you.  The toppings are standard.  The store was clean and there is a lot of paces to sit.\u000a\u000aOne thing I found funny was a sign announcing 24 hour video surveillance.  The end tag was "Please no photographs."  Is there some evil Yelper somewhere who is going to "case the joint" buy looking at Yelp photos so they can rob the place?  It just seemed odd!

VOne of the coldest nights of the winter and I decide to stop for yogurt.  What was I thinking?\u000a\u000aIt turned out to be a great idea.  The yogurt is very flavorful.  I had some cookies and cream and some taro.  The taro was exceptional.  I really enjoyed it.\u000a\u000aSince it was so cold and near closing time, I had the place to myself.  How convenient.  I'll come back when I don't eat so quickly so I prevent the staff from closing if they need to.  I'll also be back when it's warmer.  This is some of the best frozen yogurt I've had!\u000a\u000aBTW, it's no longer 30 cents per ounce.  It's something like 37 cents.

VI can't give MOzen Bistro anything less than 5 stars.  I came for breakfast today and I was so glad I did.  MOzen is on the 3rd floor of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in CityCenter.  The view of the Veer Towers and Crystals is excellent, but I didn't come for that.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Nantucket Eggs--Grilled jumbo lump crab cakes, poached eggs, baby spinach and hollandaise sauce (from their menu).  I also got a nice round of cubed breakfast potatoes topped with two asparagus spears and two grilled tomato wedges.  I also ordered pork sausage links as a side.  The crab in the crab cakes was excellent and the poached eggs were done the way I like them.  Everything was very tasty.\u000a\u000aI can't review MOzen without mentioning the excellent service I received.  My server, Alejandro, let me know this would take a bit longer to prepare and asked if that was all right.  During the wait, the manager came by and introduced himself.  He learned I was a local and seemed pleased to have a local visiting the restaurant. He brought me the dinner menu and invited me to return for some Asian fusion dishes.  He also offered to bring me a newspaper to read while I waited.\u000a\u000aAlejandro was equally gracious and on the ball.  He refilled my coffee several times, came by to see if everything was prepared right, and saw to it that I received excellent service.\u000a\u000aThe place is pricey, but it was well worth it and I knew the prices before going there.   I will be back to have dinner.  This was an excellent breakfast experience!

VWe have been going to try this place for years and never got around to it.  Friday night, we had a show on Fremont Street, so this was now on our list.\u000a\u000aI had prime rib, done rare as I ordered, and my wife had a filet, done medium rare as she ordered.  She had a salad for an appetizer and I had clam chowder.  The chowder was good and I ate half of Andrea's salad.  With dinner, we got an order of steamed asparagus with hollandaise and shared.  Everything was well prepared and excellent.  Service was prompt.\u000a\u000aThe ubiquitous flat panel screens are here, too, but instead of the omnipresent sports on TV, they had a DVD loop with scenes of various places in Italy--from Rome to Venice and other destinations.  The HD quality of the video was superb, and it was quite relaxing.\u000a\u000aWe will return to The Flame.

VNamaste - Hello, I've been waiting quite awhile to meet you.  I came today to try your lunch buffet, and it's every bit as good as others have commented!\u000a\u000aI ate mostly vegetarian dishes because they were so good and they came first on the buffet.  There wasn't much room for anything else.  Well yes there was, but the vegetarian selections were excellent!\u000a\u000aFor plate one, I had some Saag Paneer, Dal Maknni, Butter chicken and another chicken whose name I can't remember. (Note to self - bring a notepad).  The spiciness of the first two dishes--the vegetarian ones--was simply superb!  The spices were not overpowering but were just right.  There was also a little bite which is always welcome.\u000a\u000aFor plate two, I had some Aloo Korma, Fried cabbage, Eggplant Bartha, and some more Dal Maknni.  Again, the flavors were outstanding.\u000a\u000aPlate three - I tried three of their chutneys - tamarind, coconut, and mint.  They were all good, but the tamarind was my favorite.  I used them as a condiment on my naan.  While it was not needed--the naan was excellent--I did want to try the chutneys alone and this was the bets option for me.\u000a\u000aMy last dish was a small bowl of mango custard that was a perfect ending to the meal.  \u000a\u000aService was right on.  Dishes were removed, iced tea refilled, and the waiter checked on me often to see if there was anything I needed. The hostess was a simply lovely woman who was very friendly.  She had to leave while I was eating to run an errand, and she came over and thanked me for coming by and asked me to return. Top notch customer interaction!\u000a\u000aI will be back!  Now I need to nap!\u000a\u000aAgain, hello Namaste!

VWow, what a store.  All the other reviews are so much better than I could write.  Suffice it to say, looking around in here is like being a kid again.  Bins of candy--much of it different taffy flavors--are along the walls and there are sodas that you never heard of and some you haven't seen since you were a kid.  As Candace says, "Nostalgic sugar rushes here we come!"\u000a\u000aAfter coming to a store like Rocket Fizz, I looked at a lot of things, but I kept looking until I found their fairly large selection of sugar free sodas.  I bought three different kinds and a packet of sugar free Pop Rocks.  How's that for being a kid?\u000a\u000aThis is really a fun place and one at which I'll stop from time to time to try something a little different, a little weird even!

VI saw the show for the second time tonight, and it is simply wonderful!  What a talented group of guys from Australia who do, extraordinarily well,  the Motown hits I grew up with!  They sing, dance (not too bad for white guys), and they have an excellent stage presence.  The lighting adds a lot to the overall quality of the show.  I have to mention also how good their band is.    \u000a\u000aI will see this show again and anyone in Las Vegas would not be disappointed if they got tickets to this show!

VI have been driving past Greenland Supermarket during all those months (years) that it was being renovated from the previous occupant and was always going to stop after it really opened.  Today I took the time to stop and I did a lot of looking.\u000a\u000aNow I know where to go for fresh or frozen fish whether common or exotic.  The marinated meats looked great.  There were so many varieties of kimchi I'm going to need help from some fellow Yelpers before I buy.\u000a\u000aThe whole place was really well stocked with Asian foods of all kinds.  I really enjoyed the stop.

VI have seen this show two times.  The first time I saw it, I found myself fighting sleep, a fight I lost for a few moments a couple of times.  I decided to go back last night and give Caliendo a second chance.  \u000a\u000aThe show is OK.  I really enjoyed the band before Caliendo was introduced.  They played a Beatles, a KISS, a Neil Diamond, and Jesse's girl and it was quite a lot of fun especially watching and listening to different audience members and how they reacted to the songs.\u000a\u000aCaliendo came out and started with his impressions.  He certainly does Bush and Clinton well, but he has yet to do Obama well.  I think he drives his impression of Charles Barkley into the ground by overdoing it.  It's just trbl, trbl, trbl!\u000a\u000aThe most enjoyable part of the show for me is his bit lying on the floor.  His hand gestures are funny, and this was the best part for me!\u000a\u000aI think the show is worth seeing especially if you get reduced price tickets at one of the ticket booths.

VAfter our Hot N Juicy UYE, most of the group headed here for dessert and was it a trip worth taking.  I had just bookmarked the new business--yesterday was their second day open--when Shirley and Teri decided we'd go here after the UYE if we weren't too full.\u000a\u000aWe picked out what we wanted and took it to a large dining room type table with some fresh flowers for their grand opening.  I got a macaron that was filled with gif and goat cheese.  What a wonderful combination!  Light crisp outside shell and a smooth interior.  I also got a box of 6 macarons to bring home--maple bacon, s'mores, pumpkin, and Nutella.  I can't remember the other two but they look great and based on the one I ate last night, they will be good!!  The macarons are about 3 inches in diameter--more like the ones at Bouchon than other bakeries that sell them.\u000a\u000aWhile we were having our treats and chatting at the table, the owner came around with a sample of their rich hot chocolate.  It was very good.\u000a\u000aFor those who have been to a movie or were out shopping, this is a nice place to stop and unwind a bit.  Order some wine and have a sweet.  The interior is very pleasant and the staff is great!  Considering this was their second day open, they did a great job when the seven of us descended on the place.  They're open late on Friday and Saturday.\u000a\u000aTo the owner--after you've got everything in order there, open another location on the west side of town.  Then I'd see you more often.

VI stopped here last night on the way out of Red Rock Casino and bought a few bagels to bring home.  I had one this morning - salt - my favorite.  It was very good.  The place is a bit pricey with the bagels being $1 each, but you're paying for the location and the convenience.\u000a\u000aIf you were playing in the Sports Book, I could see where you might want to go here for a quick sandwich to eat while you watched the game or race.

VI wanted to try something different for breakfast after an appointment and before I went to give blood.  I've been meaning to try the TPC Grille for awhile but it never comes to mind when I'm out and about.  Today was different.  The other TPC course in our area is a private course, so this is where I headed today.\u000a\u000aI got the Southwestern Eggs Benedict which according to the menu consists of roasted corn cakes, chorizo, fried eggs, chile cheddar cheese, pico, green onion, avocado, and breakfast potatoes.  In today's case, it was missing pico and avocado, but it was very good nonetheless.  I really enjoyed the flavor of the corn cakes and I liked the different take on Eggs Benedict by going with the corn cakes instead of an English muffin.  The corn cakes were very tasty!\u000a\u000aService was excellent. I sat at the bar and Theresa was the server.  She was a very pleasant woman and very efficient.  It was nice chatting with her about breakfast places and it was so nice looking out the windows at the view of the mountains on the west side of town.\u000a\u000aThe dining room is relatively small, but they have a nice outdoor seating area.  I'll have to come back when I can sit on the patio.  Right now, it's just too cold.  This was a very pleasant experience and I'm glad I came here.

VAfter taking 3 friends to see Sandy Hackett's Rat Pack Show at the Sahara, I passed on the chance to have them buy a buffet dinner at Paris Las Vegas.  Instead, I was off to Lola's in search of some Cajun cuisine and I got it!\u000a\u000aI started out with the craw puppies, followed this with the bronzed cat fish with smoked gouda grits and andouille sausage,.  Finally, I had bread pudding for dessert.\u000a\u000aEverything was excellent.  Service was a delight, the restaurant is small and quite comfortable, and the food was delicious.  I saved some of my garlic bread to soak up the spicy juices left in the bowl after I finished the cat fish and grits.  I thought it would be unseemly to lick the bowl clean.\u000a\u000aLola came to the table and introduced herself.  She was wearing a Saints blouse.  She's quite a lovely woman.\u000a\u000aI will be back!

VMy wife and I came here to use a Groupon we purchased.  We used to come here periodically but haven't been back in years with the proliferation of new restaurants in the area. \u000a\u000aWe were brought iced tea quickly and a basket with some corn muffins and butter.  Our server, Desiree, took our order promptly.  I got a cup of baked potato soup with bacon and chive topping.  It had a lot of cheese mixed in and it was excellent.  It didn't help with my cold much but it was worth the try!\u000a\u000aFor our mains, we each got the 6 ounce filet served with large potato wedges and a ramekin with creamed spinach and some browned cheese on top.  The seasonings on the potato wedges and the steaks were very tasty and the steaks were good like we ordered.  \u000a\u000aWe had the smaller steaks so there was room for dessert.  We should have shared.  They were very large.  My wife got the brownie with ice cream and I got the pecan and chocolate pie.  Both were very good.\u000a\u000aA few things about the service.  Evidently there's only one person serving at the time we were there and we waited several minutes for someone to come to seat us.  Later, Desiree had to take care of all the tables and our wait for things was longer than need be.  \u000a\u000aA very pleasant meal in nice surroundings.

VWe met friends here for dinner tonight and had a great meal.  On my first pass, I got some stir fried bok choy, a selection of grilled, cold vegetables, blackened catfish, and a piece of garlic-parmesan bread.  All were quite good!\u000a\u000aFore the second pass, I had Mongolian grilled assorted seafood with snow peas, garlic, chili paste, fresh chopped garlic, mushrooms, and baby corn.  I got it done with the garlic, chili sauce and it was excellent with a good amount of spiciness.  It could have had a bit more zing!\u000a\u000aDessert was a strawberry milkshake and a piece of chocolate cake.\u000a\u000aI really like this buffet as a change.  They have dishes here that aren't served at Red Rock, so it's a treat to make the trek to Henderson now and then to eat here.  Besides, our friends had coupons for four free buffets, so the price was excellent!

VChart House was never on my radar.  I used Yelp to find a place to have dinner before the book club meeting and up popped Chart House.  It turns out that I've walked by it a number of times and never knew it was a restaurant.  I only thought it was a bar/lounge.  But, behind that large fish tank is another side and that's where the restaurant is.\u000a\u000aI was seated promptly right along the glass of the fish tank.  It's a great place to sit because you are almost constantly watching the fish swim when you're not eating--eating seafood even.  I wonder if anyone would like an enclosed, sealed calf range in a steak house.  \u000a\u000aMy server was Haley and she was good.  She took my order after answering a few questions.  I was brought my iced tea (blackberry, bottled Republic of Tea) and a runner brought some bread and butter.  The bread was OK.  The rye roll was good.  It was brought warm.  The flat bread, soda wafers were quite dry and not as good.\u000a\u000aFor a started, I ordered the ménage soup.  It's a trio of small cups of their three soups--lobster bisque, gazpacho, and clam chowder.  The gazpacho was hands down the best.  The clam chowder was good.  The lobster bisque was average.\u000a\u000aFor the main course, I got their spicy yellowfin ahi served with a ginger soy sauce and wasabi cream and accompanied by wasabi mashed potatoes.  The ahi was cooked very rare--just seared and off the grill.  It was excellent and the wasabi sauce was very good.  The wasabi mashed potatoes were also very good.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I had ordered the hot chocolate lava cake.  The menu states to leave 30 minutes prep time for specialty desserts and when I was ordering dinner in the beginning, Haley asked me about this.  I ordered the cake then so there'd be plenty of time to make it at the correct time during my meal.\u000a\u000aThe cake was excellent.  Chocolate goodness topped with Heath bar crunch and vanilla ice cream.\u000a\u000aThe meal and service were very good and the fish tank is lots of fun.  It was a hoot watching the people watch the fish.  The tank is 75,000 gallons and has dozens of fish.  Haley told me that a diver is in the tank daily for cleaning and feeding.  The only drawback was that I was at the first table in from the lounge and some of the happy hour people were quite loud when they got some alcohol in them.

VI was a bit disappointed with this first try of Seranno's tapas restaurant in Aria although the food was very good.  It was the service that was somewhat off.  I decided before I went to try the signature tasting menu--four courses with choices in each section.  \u000a\u000aFirst course was a choice of a salad or Castilian soup.  I ordered the soup.  My server came back in a short time to tell me they no longer have that soup, and she showed me a menu from which I could choose from three different dishes.  I opted for the Lobster gazpacho.  The server then said, "You know that's cold, don't you?"  Do I look that much like a rube? (that's rhetorical!)  The gazpacho was excellent.  Great tomato flavor and there were several pieces of tasty lobster.\u000a\u000aCourse two was the creamy risotto with wild mushrooms and manchego cheese.  The risotto was very flavorful and very enjoyable!\u000a\u000aFor the third course, I chose the Crispy chicken breast roulada with sautéed potatoes, pork chorizo, and roasted red pepper.  Very tasty!\u000a\u000aFinally, I was allowed to order anything off their dessert menu rather than choose from the two choices on the tasting menu.  I chose the molten chocolate cake, with orange jelly and blood orange sorbet.  I didn't taste any orange jelly.  The sorbet was sitting on top of some chopped mango.  The cake and the sorbet were very tasty.  It's nice they allow you to choose any dessert because they're all the same price.\u000a\u000aAs for the service, aside from the question about gazpacho mentioned above, I was enjoying the risotto and was not yet finished with it when the server brought the chicken roulada and placed it along side the risotto.  It's not like the place was crowded and they were moving the guests out quickly.  Shouldn't a server check before they bring out a dish like this?  My iced tea was not refilled until it was time to order dessert.  It should have been much sooner.  I wonder why a tapas place like this bothers with a tasting menu. \u000a\u000aThe dinner was good but it wasn't something that caused me to think that I had to return to this restaurant.  There are too many other places.

VI had 2 dips of cinnamon frozen yogurt.  It was excellent.  As others have mentioned, it's a bit pricey here.  I marked the place down because of the lack of value and the area where you eat.  Since the store is so small, the only tables are in the Miracle Mile Shops hallway, narrow in this section, and there are people walking by constantly.  Not even good people watching.\u000a\u000aIf I go back, I'll take the yogurt into the casino and sit at a machine where there's more room.

VI stopped in today to try some gelato.  I had the peach which was quite good.  I also bought 5 assorted macarons and brought home to enjoy the next few days.  I wonder if they'll last a few days or not.  \u000a\u000aYong, the young man who waited on me, was excellent.  I really enjoyed my stop.  I wish it wasn't so far from the Aria garage here, but it's worth the walk.\u000a\u000aNevada residents get a discount.  Show your ID.

VI came for happy hour pricing last night and was not disappointed.  The prices are higher than their online menu. The steaks are $4 or $5 more.  I got the Kansas City ribeye and it was $14.50, half of the regular $29.  With you dinner comes one side and I got the creamed corn with japaeño.  The steak was cooked perfectly--black and blue as I ordered.  The creamed corn was excellent with the tang of the jalapeño.  I got an iced tea for drink.  Finally, I had a slice of Red Velvet cake for dessert.\u000a\u000aI came early and was the only person there when I arrived around 5:30.  As others have stated, the place is quite dark and it takes a time to adjust from the bright sunshine to the darkened interior.\u000a\u000athe hostess let me pick where I wanted to sit.  Ronnie was my server, and he was attentive.  Iced tea refills came without asking and he checked back periodically.\u000a\u000aI had a show to go to at 7 in North Las Vegas, and this was a perfect time to arrive and enjoy the Happy Hour pricing and have a good dinner before hopping on the freeway for the short drive north.\u000a\u000aI'll be back!

VI've been to this iconic sign on one occasion although I've driven by a lot of times.  This is one of my "must dos" when I have friends in town.  Betty Willis did us all a great big favor in designing such a wonderful sign that has come to represent Las Vegas anywhere you are in the world.\u000a\u000aThe parking spaces in the median that opened in the last two years make a visit by tourists and locals alike an easy stop.  Access to the lot is from the southbound lanes of Las Vegas Boulevard.  There's no need to try to cross the Boulevard to get a photo op.\u000a\u000aI won't upload any of my photos as the ones here do a great job!

VBonkerz is a good comedy club.  I have been coming here for several years since it transitioned into a comedy club first as the LA Comedy Club.\u000a\u000aWe came last night to see Louie Anderson in his Louie LOL show.  He's quite good.\u000a\u000aAs for the other comics, I find it's hit or miss.  I have been here sometimes when I've laughed a lot, and there have been some night when two attempts at jokes seemed like an hour.  It's quite interesting to see how comics deal with a small audience of mostly seniors who are locals.\u000a\u000aDo a little research with their schedule when you pick a night to go.

VI have been going to Insurgo productions for a couple of years, and I was excited to see them get their own theatre in Sahara Commercial Center.  Since its opening several months ago, improvements have been made, and the theatre has gotten better.\u000a\u000aLast night, I attended Rossum's Universal Robots by Karel Capek.  This is very well done by a terrific cast.  It will be playing until July 10th, so you only have a short time if you want to see the show, too!\u000a\u000aCheck out their website.  There is something playing there almost every weekend.

VI really like Canal Street.  As tourists, we went here many times.  As residents, we've only been here once in the last 11 years.  It was time to go back and see if it was as good as always and it was.\u000a\u000aThe bread basket consisted of a couple of pieces of tasty lavash and two rolls, one a walnut and raisin and the other I don't know because I didn't want to fill up on bread.  The butter comes with a piece of processed cheese spread with grapes and cranberries.  Very tasty!\u000a\u000aI started with a house salad that comes with all entrées.  It's built almost like a small Cobb salad with greens in the middle and small mounds of diced tomato, bleu cheese, candied walnuts, hearts of palm, cucumber, and hard boiled egg around the perimeter.  I got bleu cheese dressing and the salad was very good.\u000a\u000aMy main course was the 8 ounce filet done black and blue.  With the steak came some summer vegetables cooked very little.  They were crispy and they were good!  I ordered a salted baked potato as a side.  My steak was done perfectly and the baked potato with that rich salt was very, very good.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I got the Canal Street bread pudding with blueberries and a Bourbon whiskey vanilla sauce.  The bread pudding was different.   Not only was there the vanilla sauce, but the bread had a distinct chocolate infusion and there was chocolate sauce along with the vanilla.  Excellent.\u000a\u000aService was very good.  Iced tea was refilled without asking, finished dishes were removed promptly, and there was adequate time between courses to relax and enjoy the surroundings.  I wasn't rushed nor was service slow.\u000a\u000aI like the room.  It has a New Orleans theme with one side being a mural.  In about an hour's time, the lights on the mural slowly dim and the fluorescent paint starts to glow with the blue lights and it looks like the lights in the mansion along the river or on the paddle wheel boat were turned on.  Then the lights slowly pick up and eventually it's daytime again.  I've always liked that ambiance and it was there again last night.

VReview for Restaurant Week Fall 2012 menu only:\u000a\u000aI went to Mastros tonight for the first time and I convinced my wife to try Restaurant Week, too!  We were very pleased with the meal.\u000a\u000aWe got a nice bread basket with several types of bread.  I really liked the pretzel rolls with salt.  There were five choices in the basket.\u000a\u000aCourse 1:  We each got a salad--my wife's was a Caesar and mine was their spicy mambo salad.  They were both the same greens but my dressing was made with some wasabi, hence the spicy.  Both salads had a good amount of freshly grated cheese on them and they were very tasty.\u000a\u000aCourse 2:  I ordered the Scottish salmon and Andrea got the 8 ounce filet cooked medium.  I had several preparations from which to choose for the salmon and I chose the blackened option.  The salmon was delicious.  The filet was very good, too.  \u000a\u000aWith their Restaurant Week menu, diners can choose two sides.  We each ordered garlic mashed potatoes.  My wife ordered the creamed spinach and I got the creamed corn.  The sides were huge.  Since we each ordered the mashed potatoes, we got a regular portion which is their standard size for sides.  The corn and spinach were smaller versions.  All three were very good.  I needed salt, but then anything needs salt.  Samantha started us out by giving each of us some of the sides so we each could try everything.\u000a\u000aCourse 3:  For dessert, Andrea got the chocolate layer cake and I got the Key lime pie.  ALong with the desserts, we were brought a large bowl of freshly made whopped cream--lightly sweetened.  The chocolate cake was huge.  My Key lime pie was more a normal size.  Both were outstanding!!\u000a\u000aWe ate in the Tree House overlooking the shops at Crystals.  Service was superb!  Our server, Samantha, was excellent.  The staff cleared tables promptly, cleaned the table cloth between (not that I'm a slob or anything), our iced teas were refilled often, and the pace of the meal was perfect!  \u000a\u000aI am so glad Mastros participated in Restaurant Week.  It gave me a chance to try it and I will be back.  What a fantastic start to RW Fall 2012.

VWhat's to say about a post office.  I had to mail a package and I dropped it off here directly.  I printed the postage at home, so it was simply a matter of getting my package into the box at the PO so it went out as soon as possible.\u000a\u000aThere is ample parking.  Sometimes the line inside can be awful.

VReview for building only:  I did not stay at the Cosmopolitan.  I made a walking tour of the casino, restaurant, and ballroom areas yesterday.  I was really impressed with the design and the ease of getting around.  For a property on such a narrow strip of land, it really seems gigantic when you start exploring the areas where you can sit and relax, enjoy some art, and maybe do some Yelp reviews to catch up.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant area is very compact.  I was very impressed with almost everything I saw.  Now I have to go back and start trying some of the restaurants.\u000a\u000aI am so pleased that this new place finally opened and that it was designed with a lot of thought!

VMy wife had an appointment yesterday with Dr. Wint.  He was very competent, thorough, and understanding.  The staff were all pleasant and I understand their need to be.  It does get a bit overdone in my perspective.\u000a\u000aThe naming of the Tranquility Room was something I couldn't fathom.  It didn't make me anymore tranquil especially with the 24 hour news channel they had on the TV.

VThis location was the only one that had in stock medication prescribed for my wife.  It's not my customary CVS, but I was really pleased by the wide aisles and the larger interior of the store.  It was not nearly as cramped with stock as other CVS stores I've been in.\u000a\u000aThe pharmacist was quick and I was on my way in no time.  A good location, but a very quiet one.

VI went to Three Square last night for the Roasting Las Vegas fund raising event.  The title of the program was "Roasting Las Vegas: The Critics can DISH it out, but can they take it?"  As it turns out, they can and it was a lot of fun!\u000a\u000aWhen I arrived at Three Square, my first time there, I was taken back by the huge size of the buildings where canned food is stored for distribution, other food is prepared for delivery to kitchens for serving those in need, and all the other space needed for helping to feed the hungry in Las Vegas.  The numbers are staggering but the one that hit me the most was that they serve one in four children in Las Vegas.  That's a staggering number of kids who depend on Three Square to augment or provide their food needs.\u000a\u000aThe three reviewers being roasted were Max Jacobson, Al Mancini, and John Curtas. Their reviews appear in the local free papers and they are known to the foodie community in Las Vegas.  This was a chance for the chefs to fight back, so to speak, and roast these critics for what they've said in their past reviews.  Chefs there to roast were Todd Harrington (executive chef of Central by Michel Richard in Caesars), Stephen Hopcraft (executive chef of STK in the Cosmopolitan and former Top Chef contestant), Gary LaMorte (corporate chef for the Michael Mina Group), Vic Vegas (executive chef of Vic's Restaurant in Henderson and former Next Food Network Star contestant), Carla Pellegrino (executive chef of Bratalian Neapolitan Cantina in Town Square and former Top Chef contestant), and Beni Valasquez (exceutive chef at the Bar + Bistro in the Arts District). Also roasting was Theresa Woo of the family that owns Fu in the Hard Rock Hotel).\u000a\u000aIt was a fun evening with a lot of laughs, some good food, and good beer and wine or so my table mates told me.  I managed to get a table near the front and next to the three tables where the chefs and their friends sat.  What a great way to help Three Square and get to see and hear the chefs we know and the critics we read.\u000a\u000aNow it's time for me to volunteer some time at Three Square and help out with their amazing work on behalf of the people in need in Las Vegas and Southern Nevada.  Next up for fundraising is Dish 2013 on September 26th at the Palms Hotel and Casino.  Join me there!

VI came here to try some bagels after my hiking at Red Rock Canyon.  I will edit my review after I've actually eaten one of them if it warrants an up or down change in stars.\u000a\u000aThe man behind the counter was polite and quick to do my order.  He laughed when I pointed out that cinnamon raisin bagels aren't really bagels but merely dry doughnuts.  I have to find a nearby bagel shop that stocks salt bagels.\u000a\u000aThis is an easy in and out for me and it's only about a mile from home.

VI wanted to update my review.  The bagels I bought were OK, but when they come frozen to be baked locally, it's not a good sign. \u000a\u000aI won't be stopping for bagels.  If I go here, I'll go for what DD made their name for - the doughnuts!

VThanks to Nelson Q., I tried Boba City today on the way home from the Mirage.  Wow, it's as good as he says.  I had the Taro milk tea with boba and it was wonderfully tasty.  I had enough left when I got home that my wife got to try some and she liked it, too!\u000a\u000aI wanted to slap the woman in front of me upside the head.  She bought the last pastries, so I have to make another stop.  Oh well, maybe that's reason to forgive her for being a hog and buying the last ELEVEN of them!  Couldn't she share one?\u000a\u000aI think I'll make a small detour at Rainbow when I'm traveling Flamingo and make some more stops at Boba City.\u000a\u000aProps to Nelson for his review which let me know about this fine place!

VI made a return visit today to try one more thing Nelson Q suggested - Avocado smoothie with boba.  Wow, this is great!  Who would have thought that avocado could taste this good blended and with boba?\u000a\u000aSince it was Monday, they had no pastries.  They don't make them and bring them out until the afternoon.  Looks like I'll have to make ANOTHER detour on Rainbow to try the pastries later this week!\u000a\u000aAs an added bonus, he gave me a sample of mango smoothie with my avocado.  Now I know what I'm getting later this week!

VI stopped today and finally got my Delimanjoo pastries - a small box of 24 miniature, custard filled delights.  I also got a chai milk tea with boba.  It was great!  When my wife asked for a taste, she said, :I want one of those."  Oh well, I'll just have to stop again!\u000a\u000aThe owners here are super friendly.  It's been two months since I was here and he remembered that I wanted the pastries.  I watched as the machine filled the small molds and he removed them with his tongs at the end of the baking.\u000a\u000aI'll be back.  This place is great.\u000a\u000aThanks, Nelson!

I had no pastry, but they had a nice selection.\u000a\u000aThis is out of my way for stopping more often, but if I'm in the neighborhood, I certainly wouldn't drive by without stopping in.

VI was in this area of town on the way from hiking at Mount Charleston and I stopped to get a new [pair of hiking boots (you always need an extra pair on hand!)\u000a\u000aThey had the brand and model I like--even though Hi-Tec has discontinued the model.  I got it on sale plus a discount for it being a display piece!  Boy, I'm glad I stopped!\u000a\u000aI have found the staff to be very pleasant and helpful.  It's a good Big 5.

VI had to waste an hour while my wife was at a doctor's appointment nearby, so I came here and did some shopping and then went to their Starbucks.  Shopping was a breeze, I did the self checkout and the barista at Starbuck's was pleasant and quick.\u000a\u000aThey don't have their wifi working yet.  It shows up as existing, but devices don't yet connect to it. It seems as though Albertsons is making wifi available in all stores where there's a Starbucks.  That's a great convenience.

VI have stopped at this Starbucks several times when I've been in this area.  It's not too far from the 15 for a fairly quick off and back on.  \u000a\u000aThe outlet is a regular Starbucks box with the normal pastries and the normal interior.  \u000a\u000aThe staff today was quite competent.  We had leisurely drinks before going to a show at CSN Cheyenne Campus.

VThis is the drug store we go to.  They have a good supply of various items, but their prices are way over what can be had at Target or Wally World.  We go here mainly for the pharmacy.  Prescriptions are ordered online and pick up is generally quick.\u000a\u000aIt's near home, there are several Starbucks nearby, the gym isn't too far away.  Parking can be an issue and getting in and out is almost bumper cars at times.

VMundo would rate a full 5 stars but I am subtracting a half star for the poor music and the high volume even at 5 PM when there were no young things there who wanted to listen to techno music done loud.\u000a\u000aOther than that, I really enjoyed going here tonight.  It is pricey, but I knew that going in and we had a $25 Restaurant.com certificate.\u000a\u000aWe were brought the chips and salsa and we ordered the guacamole.  The salsa and guacamole were great!  The waiter gave us plenty of time to study the menu.  When we were not yet decided, we asked him over to answer some of our questions. Based on his full knowledge of the menu items and their manner of cooking, we ordered.  My wife got the pollo rostisado with a side of spinach with garlic and onions.  The side came with her meal.  Since she's such a gringa, she had them make the spinach without the jalapeños (what a shame!).  Her chicken came with a great seasoning and she got the tamarind chile glaze in a side dish.  Together, the seasoning and the tamarind glaze were superb!\u000a\u000aI ordered the sea scallops with diablo spiced rice, ripe mango relish, and an avocado leaf crust on the scallops.  This was another winner with great seasoning - spicy on the scallops and good zing with the rice.  I ordered a side of Mexican style street corn with chile arbol, cotija cheese, with citrus and cilantro.  The corn was very good and it also had good spiciness.\u000a\u000aI decided to go for dessert, too.  I ordered the churros.  They serve them with caramel inside and some caramel drizzled over them.  There's a small bowl of Mexican chocolate for dipping the churros or spooning on and a small dip of vanilla ice cream.  It was a perfect end to this dinner.\u000a\u000aI really like Mundo.  I like the interior with its light wall and the chain lamps hanging from the ceiling.  It really was an enjoyable evening.  Service was prompt, friendly, and knowledgeable.  I know I'll be back!

VI started going to this branch of Labcorp after a really bad experience with another well known lab chain in Las Vegas.  I like the fact that I can make an appointment and be called in front of people who didn't.  It's available to all, but few use the appointment option.\u000a\u000aThe staff here has always been friendly and competent.  There is plenty of parking in front and in back of the medical building in which the lab is located.  The lab is on the second floor of the building.\u000a\u000aMy only problem was the building staff don't unlock the front and back doors until some time after 7:30 even though the lab opens at 7.  You have to wait until someone comes out before you can get in.  This caused me to wonder how the first clients ever get into the building.  This is not a Labcorp problem.  Rather, it lies with the management of the building.

VI have gone to this store for different reasons, but it's generally been to get a new phone.  Since I am now an iPhone user, this store is less relevant.  I came to get a SIMM card to use in a modem for 3G internet access when away from home.\u000a\u000aIt seems like no one at AT*&T knows anything about prepaid wireless.  That includes the store and the 800 support number.  \u000a\u000aThe people that work here have always been helpful as they were today, but they can't give me advice about something for which they've never been trained.

VI just got in from visiting a neighbor who's in the nursing facility section of Las Ventanas.  His wife took me on a tour of the whole facility and it is quite nice.  The dining room looks like something in a fine restaurant.  Looking at the menu for tonight's dinner and tomorrow's Father's Day brunch made me almost ask if I could stay and try the place out.  No, not really.\u000a\u000aThere's a snack area, and the exercise facility was well stocked.\u000a\u000aI talked with a friend who lives here.  He and his wife happened to be in the pool.  It's small but very nice and meets the needs of the residents.\u000a\u000aIf you have to live in a facility for older persons with health needs this would be a good choice if it fit your budget.  It certainly is beautiful.

VI went here today and found cargo shorts like I was looking for.  The store didn't have very many shoppers and it was easy to look for what I wanted, find that indeed they did have what I wanted, try it on, and then check out all within 15 minutes of entering the store.\u000a\u000aSince there were so few shoppers, parking was a breeze and I was near the one entrance.  The store is undergoing some renovation.  There are several areas blocked off with plastic walls and they're doing work inside.  I'll have to come back and see the improvements.\u000a\u000aI've been to this JCP before and it's very convenient to where I live.  I'll be back.

VI bank with Wells Fargo, so any branch is fine with me.  This one happens to have converted to the check scanning deposits without an envelope and that's quite convenient!\u000a\u000aI had to stop a second time because the armored truck person was emptying the ATM machines.  Do they have to close everything outside when they're doing this?  You definitely lost a star when I had to come back to make the deposit.

I had another stop to make in Village Square this afternoon, so I killed to birds with one stone.\u000a\u000aI quickly found what I needed, paid, and was out the door in less than three minutes.  That's good for me.

VI've been here several times for a quick car wash.  Exact amount needed as no change is given.  You have the option of a $6, $7 or $10 wash so make sure you have a $5 and a $1 or two if you want longer drying time.\u000a\u000aThe place is completely automated and usually very quick.  I'm quite pleased with the quality of the wash and it's convenient.

VI stop here periodically when I need something I forgot somewhere else or couldn't find.  I find their prices to be high compared to other chains unless you happen to hit a sale for the item you want.\u000a\u000aThe store always seems a bit cluttered and even messy.  There is often stock in plastic boxes on the floor waiting to be shelved.  It's just not a pleasant place.

VI have been to this location twice in the last two weeks.  The first time was to have a package I had to sign for redirected from my house to this office.  It was easy to set up online and all I needed to do was show photo ID and I got the package.  I found out I could have something delivered securely here and I won't miss the driver at the house.  This was good to know as I had a box stolen from outside my door.\u000a\u000aToday, I dropped off a prepaid Fedex box returning my old laptop to a recycler who does business with Apple Computer.  I got a receipt and can track the package.\u000a\u000aSince this office is only a few miles from home, the security and convenience it provides is great.  The people are very friendly and helpful also!

VI haven't spent a lot of time at the museum displays.  Rather, I often to to the Barrick for the UNLV Forum lecture series.\u000a\u000aThe museum is small as others have pointed out, but it's exhibits are wonderful.  I love the little sand digging option for youngsters to enjoy and learn while digging in sand.\u000a\u000aThere's a new exhibit starting in two days called "Visions of Peru."  I'll have to stop in and see it.\u000a\u000aThe curators have a sense of community and humor.  Here's a quote about an upcoming event:\u000a\u000aMarch 14, 2011 - March 18, 2011\u000aLocation: Marjorie Barrick Museum\u000aPlants Vacation @ the Museum during Spring Break\u000a\u000aThe Museum invites you to give your houseplant a vacation during Sping Break for a cultural retreat for plants. Throughout the week participants plants will be housed in the light flooded lobby, and presented with a series of musical events for plants.\u000aThe drop off date will be March 14, and the pick-up will be on March 18. Please e-mail barrick.museum@unlv.edu with the subject line 'PLANT VACATION' to tell us if you are interested in giving your plant a vacation.

VI came here to give it a try and chose the 3 course Prix fixe menu which consists of an appetizer, a main course, and a dessert.  I was surprised by how small the restaurant was inside.  There's more seating in the hallway that leads to the rear tower of the Tropicana Hotel.  I decided to eat inside because there had been a whole lot of people rolling suitcases down that hall and I wanted a little more quiet. The restaurant inside is almost all white.\u000a\u000aThe bread basket was brought quickly.  A couple of things here.  The bread was very dry, stale even, and the mixture of olive oil and balsamic vinegar is just the wrong shape for this dipping sauce.  There's way too much olive oil and the balsamic just sits at the bottom.  The basket had a piece of lavash, some focaccia, a roll, and a slated bread stick.  The star of that basket was the salted bread stick.\u000a\u000aFor a main course, I got the linguini with Manilla clams in a white wine sauce.  There were 10 clams arranged around the pasta.  This was excellent.  I wanted to drink the sauce left, but I used some of the bread to soak up the white wine sauce and I finished it that way.  For those who don't like salty foods, I could taste a fair amount of salt in the sauce.  I love salt so this was a good thing.  Others need to be warned about that.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I got the tiramisu.  This was a very large piece of tiramisu different from what I've generally had, but it was very tasty.  On top was a lot of cocoa powder which set off the sweetness beneath.\u000a\u000aThe prix fixe menu gives you coffee or tea and a glass of house wine.  I got iced tea and instead of wine, I had a cup of coffee with dessert.  At most places, that would cause fits and an extra charge.  Here it was just fine!\u000a\u000aI was going to give Bacio 3.5 stars, but shortly after I was seated, Chef Pellegrino had a meltdown with one of her staff--enough so that most people in the restaurant looked where she was and watched and listened.  She was giving grief to one of her bus people for wasting bread.  The meltdown ended with her saying, "That costs money."  She walked out of the restaurant for a few moments and then came back.  The show was worth an extra 1/2 star.  Brava!  The service by all the staff was superb!\u000a\u000aI do have one complaint.  The French term for your kind of menu, Chef Pellegrino, is Prix fixe as you well know.  Please don't be lazy and spell it prefix like many people do who have no clue as to the origin of the term.  I know it sounds like prefix but don't succumb to dumbing down your own menu because people don't know.\u000a\u000aChef Pellegrino is very talented.  She was working in the kitchen all the time I was there.  Obviously she cares.  I am sure I'll make a return visit!

VAfter an 8 mile bike ride along the Flamingo Wash, I used Yelp to find the nearest Starbucks and this was it.  I don't generally do drive throughs so I parked in their small lot and went inside the store.\u000a\u000aI ordered my drink, it was ready quickly, and I enjoyed part of it while checking my email on their free wifi.  \u000a\u000aThe staff was very pleasant and on the ball.  I can't say I'll be stopping here often, but it fit my needs yesterday!

VThe Spazmatics are a good group that play a variety of songs some that I knew.  They started playing around 10:30 and ended their first set about 11:50.  Shortly after that, I left and made my way home.\u000a\u000aThe following the band has makes the evening a lot of fun, too!  There were a number of people dancing in the area in front of the stage where the Las Vegas showroom style tables and chairs had been removed to make room.\u000a\u000aWe had a group reservation so we were seated in the two large booths stage right.  We also got two drink tickets with the admission.\u000a\u000aThe guys in the band are very active as they play and sing, moving about the stage and engaging the audience.  Many in the audience dressed in 80s style clothes to celebrate the Spazmatics genre.\u000a\u000aThe only suggestion has nothing to do with the group.  Getting seated for this even by the South Point showroom staff was slow.  When you have VIP tickets, you'd think you'd be in early.  You'd be wrong.  All the general admission were in before us.\u000a\u000aI don't think I'd go back and see them again and I certainly wouldn't wait to the early hours of Sunday for their second set.  They are worth seeing once.

VI don't drink.  I needed a gift to bring to a host of a party to which I'm going.  What better than wine?\u000a\u000aWhat do you do when you don't know anything about wine and you don't want to buy "Two buck Chuck?"  Go to Total Wine and be overwhelmed by the massive inventory.\u000a\u000aRead the descriptions, pick a reasonably priced wine, and quickly pay at the register and voila, you have your gift.\u000a\u000aIt would be a much better experience if I knew what the hell I was doing!

I stopped here for a quick ice cream last night and I was immediately impressed with the newness and nice design of the place.\u000a\u000aThe staff took my order quickly, and I was on my way to a table very quickly.  The tables were clean and the restaurant was clean.  I was really impressed!\u000a\u000aThey have free wifi which is a nice bonus.  If I need at break some day and I'm in the area, I'll definitely stop again.

VI have to give US Airways 3 stars for this trip.  On some others, it would have been a negative rating.\u000a\u000aThe two flights--one from Las Vegas to Philadelphia and the other from Philadelphia to Wilkes-Barre--Scranton were both on time.\u000a\u000aService was pleasant.  We flew first class on the LAS to PHL leg and that certainly makes a big difference.  Lunch was actually quite good and the chocolate cake dessert was rich and tasty.\u000a\u000aOK, US Airways, keep the rating going with my return flight--I dare you!

VI stopped yesterday to buy some bagels in my quest for better ones than I get at the big chain.  I had a salt bagel this morning, and it was quite good.  \u000a\u000aI really look forward to going back and having some lunch.  Levy's appears like it will be my stop for bagels more often.

V3.5 stars\u000a\u000aI'm not sure I  agree with the Esquire Magazine comment that Du-Pars makes the best pancakes in the country,  They are good.  They are fluffy.  So were my mother's.  I guess I'm not a plain pancake person.  When I have pancakes for breakfast, I want something more exotic--banana and macadamia nut, red velvet, cookie crumb, or something even crazier.  Maybe I just grew out of liking plain pancakes.  These are good, but so are many others.\u000a\u000aI think I'd like to try Du-Pars for a lunch of some kind.  I like the feel of the room.  Our server was quite good today.  She made sure we had refills of coffee.

VI went to the Slider Truck by Cox Communication near Rancho today.  I had the Pulled Porkie and it was excellent.  They sold out of sweet potato fries, so I had to settle for regular, which are excellent.\u000a\u000aI'd like to give real stars in the heads of some people who came with orders for large numbers of sliders.  It made the wait quite long, and being about 100 degrees outside, it was a tad uncomfortable with just one small tree with shade.  I will find this truck again and go earlier.  Perhaps I'll find it far away from another office building.  \u000a\u000aThe good thing about this was that I initially heard of where the truck would be from a Nevada State Museum Facebook post.  I had my sandwich and did as they suggested.  I went to museum after lunch.

V******* 3.5 stars *******\u000a\u000aI stopped here last night with a coupon from the parent company Lettuce Entertain You.  I sat on the patio.  It was very pleasant with all the LP heaters around and it was fun watching the tourists walking on the Strip.\u000a\u000aI started with a bowl of tortilla soup.  It was quite good and the service was different.  The bowl was placed on the table.  In it were tortilla strips, avocado cubes, some cilantro, queso fresco, and some pasilla chilis.  The server then poured the soup from a pitcher over the "dry" ingredients in the bowl.  The soup had a very nice flavor and was a good start to the meal.\u000a\u000aThe main dish was the carne asada tacos.  The server had asked how I wanted the steak cooked and it came out rare as ordered.  There were rice, beans, and the steak slices with 5 small soft tacos standing in a metal container.  The beef was good, but the rice and beans were a little bland.  Nothing a little Tapatio couldn't help!  \u000a\u000aFor dessert, I got the chocolate layer cake.  It was a circular chocolate layer cake coated in chocolate with some freshly made whipped cream.  Excellent!  You can tell from my photo that I didn't care for it at all.  I almost asked for a clean straw so I could snort the remaining crumbs.\u000a\u000aSummary:  The meal was good but it is pricey and not somewhere I'd go without some coupon.  I give it an extra 1/2 star because my server, Tiffany, was absolutely top notch.  Pleasant, friendly, and attentive are good descriptors.  After eating 4 times in the last two weeks at Lettuce Entertain You restaurants in Las Vegas, she was the only person who asked if I was a member of their frequent diners' club.  I was not but I am now thanks to her.  Her level of service kicks my rating up.

VI stopped here last night for a quick treat on my way home.  I was pleased to see they were open to 11 PM on a weekday night and I made it with plenty of time.\u000a\u000aThere was an excellent selection of flavors and toppings.  I chose some red velvet and Reese's peanut butter.  I wasn't owed by the red velvet.  I think I'm over that fad of mine.  I did love the peanut butter.  I added a few toppings and I had a nice snack.\u000a\u000aI ate inside.  It was late and it was cold!  I'll be back.  This is an easy stop when coming from the Strip back home.

VThis should be on everyone's to do list.  It is a fun couple of hours sailing across the Ivanpah Dry Lake near Primm, Nevada.  I went in a group with 2 other sailors and it was a lot of fun!  \u000a\u000aThe owner of the firm, Pete, drove us to Primm, put together the land cruisers, and gave us instructions on how to use the steering and the rope to guide our movements across the desert.\u000a\u000aAfter that, we were free to zoom over the dry lake and have fun, and that's just what the three of us did.  It was great!\u000a\u000aPete had an insulated cooler with lots of cold water.  He had extra sunscreen for anyone who needed it, and he had snacks for après sailing.\u000a\u000aHere is some video of one of the people on our outing.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy3vOa8ud_k\u000a\u000aPut this on your To Do list for Las Vegas!  You'll love it!  If your spouse likes to shop, drive to Primm, let them spend several hours at the outlet mall, and you go over and join Pete.  That would be a win/win situation for many!

VWe met at the park to carpool to the Desert Tortoise Conservation Center.  I wasn't there long, but it was long enough to know that I wanted to come back and walk to the top of the hill that overlooks the Las Vegas Valley.\u000a\u000aThe facilities looked like they were well taken care of and the children's area had a stage coach that the kids were playing in and having a great time.  There are a lot of sidewalks through the area and it seems a great place to walk or jog.

VI had an extended bike ride this Sunday morning, so I decided to add breakfast into my morning ride.  I've been in the plaza several times when I was picking up Thai food nearby, but I never never stopped here.  Sunday, they open a 8 and I was there at 8:10.  A little warmer and I could have eaten outside, but it is December!\u000a\u000aMisty was my server and she was a gem!  Very pleasant smile, lots of helpful information, lots of coffee refills.  \u000a\u000aI ordered the Red Rock Bene which the menu describes as layers of Focaccia bread, bacon, fresh spinach, poached eggs, and homemade Hollandaise.  It's not "layers" of Focaccia.  Rather, there are two very large cuts of Focaccia each about two and a half to three inches tall.  I'm guessing those are the cliffs at Red Rock.  The rest was the standard Benedict except for the bacon.  The breakfast comes with choice of home fries or breakfast potatoes and if you get breakfast potatoes, you can get them plain or with fried onion and peppers.  There's a small charge for the onions and peppers, something I didn't see on the menu.\u000a\u000aThe Bene was OK.  There's simply too much bread. I ate one slab and halfway through that, I moved the other poached egg and spinach onto the half eaten cliff.  The breakfast potatoes were seasoned well and the onion and peppers were very good.  Worth the up charge.  Other than too much bread, my one complaint would be that the eggs were poached too long.  They were not runny when pierced but were semi hard yolks.  \u000a\u000aNote:  Saturday and Sunday are the only days they sell the two kinds of Benedicts.\u000a\u000aI really liked the inside.  The 60s, tie dyed things, peace symbols, and the music being played that I grew up with made for humming along with the sound track.  It was OK.  There was only one couple besides me in the place and they were at the other end so no one needed to go running out!\u000a\u000aThe sign of Lucille Ball and Vitametavegamin sealed the deal for me.  A place that would have this sign is A-OK in my book!  Check out Elvis.  He's in the bathroom.

VI was going to downtown Las Vegas last night for a show, so I decided to stop for dinner at the Bar + Bistro.  I made one error in that it was First Friday in the Arts District and the restaurant has an abbreviated menu for that evening.\u000a\u000aI went with two of their tapas plates and a dessert.  I started with their roasted tomate soup.  It was excellent.  The second dish was their 5 cheese mac and cheese a combination of smoked gouda, sharp cheddar, fontina, Manchego, roasted tomato, piquillo peppers, and parmesan crisp.  The pasta was gigli.  The mac and cheese was very tasty, too!\u000a\u000aI rounded out my dinner with a warm chocolate ganache cake.  It, too, was excellent.  It was served with a small scoop of sorbet and it was a perfect ending.\u000a\u000aAll things considered, I'd rather have come here on a night when I could have ordered from the full menu, but I had the chance to taste some of their good cuisine.  I think it's a bit pricey for what you get.  I enjoyed the decor a lot.  The tables shaped like artists' palettes with a metal well in many.  One thing that got me several times was the thought that I had dripped something onto the table.  When I looked, it was merely some spattered paint when they were decorating the tables.  Every time I looked down, it was a "gotcha."

V4.5 stars\u000a\u000aThis review is for the Restaurant Week 2011 Breakfast.\u000a\u000aThis was my first visit to DW Bistro.  I've been going to try it but never thought about going there when I was thinking of a different place.  Restaurant Week 2011 gave me a great reason to go.\u000a\u000aThe breakfast menu (good only Saturday and Sunday) had 3 courses.  The first two courses had three choices each and the third course - dessert - no choice but you didn't need any choice.  More on that later.\u000a\u000aFor my first course, I chose the DW oatmeal with toasted coconut and cream.  There were fresh berries including blueberries, red and yellow raspberries, blackberries, and some currants.  The toasted coconut added a texture and flavor that made this a great dish.  4/5 rating.\u000a\u000aFor the second course, I asked the advice of my server and I went with the crab cake Eggs Benedict with spicy Hollandaise and breakfast potatoes.  The crab in the cake was excellent.  The spicy Hollandaise was great, and the house potatoes had a zing that made them very tasty when compared with the normal fried breakfast potatoes.  5/5 rating.\u000a\u000aDessert course -- talk about decadent!  As I said, there was no choice for the dessert course because it was a sampler of four of DW's desserts.  They were: Red Velvet cake, whipped peanut butter pie, lemon-lime pudding with one blueberry (neat presentation for this), and Jamaican black bottom banana cream pie.  5/5 rating.\u000a\u000aService:  My server was Maggie and I never had to sing "Wake Up Maggie May."  She was on top of everything including getting me a clean saucer and a clean up from some spilled coffee--without me asking.  She also recommended the crab Benedict because it's not available all the time but my other choice is on the regular menu.  That's what a good server does and Maggie was superb!\u000a\u000aA few little minuses - the oatmeal could have been served a bit hotter; what ever happened to spoons in restaurants in Las Vegas?  Do we have a severe spoon shortage of which I'm unaware.  I didn't get one with my coffee, but I didn't need one as I drink it black.  She only knew I didn't need cream.  What about sweetener?; and, the noise level was a bit high for so few people there.  There is little wall covering to absorb the sounds.  It wasn't bothersome, but it was noticeable.\u000a\u000aNow that I've been here, I know I'll be back for dinner and another breakfast to try the jerk pork hash.

VI've been to the showroom for three shows.  Tonight I was there to see Davy Jones of the Monkees.  I really like this showroom.  It's a very comfortable place with good sight lines from anywhere in the showroom.  \u000a\u000aPrices are on three levels and they are relatively inexpensive.  There are three types of seating at each price level - classic long tables seating eight or ten people, half on each side, booths, and round tables that seat 4 people.  Even from the cheapest seats in the rear of the theatre, the distance to the stage is not great so sitting in the cheapest seats is OK.  Also, there are two large screens, one on each side of the stage, so you can have a close up view of the performer.\u000a\u000aOne nice touch is that there are bathrooms in the showroom.  You don't have people coming in and out with casino noise coming into the room.  Also, there's a bar in the theatre in addition to waitress service.\u000a\u000aIt's a very nice venue!

VMy experience with Soyo was disappointing.  I ordered two items from the tapas section of the menu--chicken gizzards with garlic and onion and son doo boo.  The chicken gizzards were good, chewy but that's the nature of the meat.  The son doo boo is supposed to be in beef broth.  The water the two pieces of tofu rested in shouldn't be referred to as broth.  Broth connotes some type of meat/fish flavor.  This had none.  It was merely a watery dish with a side of dot dipping sauce.\u000a\u000aIt was the wrong day to go to Soyo.  The place is very small.  The tables are such that it's not a good place for a person eating alone.  I was there a little after 5:30 and there were only a few people in the restaurant.  Within a very short time, young people getting dinner before going to EDC came in and I was taking up a table that could seat four or even six.  There was an error with my order and rather than have them bring the correct item ordered, I hurriedly finished and paid the bill so someone else could have the table.\u000a\u000aThere are too many good choices out there.  Soyo won't be a do over for me.

VWe had our Yelp book club get together at the Beat Coffeehouse last night.  There's a small room behind the food counter on the way to the gallery section that has a high table and 8 chairs--perfect for our needs.\u000a\u000aInstead of coffee, I had a strawberry/banana smoothie.  It was quite good although I thought it was pricey for the size I got.

VWe decided to go a bit out of the way and try Surang's tonight.  It was quite good.  We had an order of spring rolls with tamarind sauce that was excellent.  My wife had the Spicy Basil with ground chicken and I had the Pad Prik King with chicken.  Her spiciness was 0 and mine was 6.  Both dishes were very tasty.\u000a\u000aA note on their spiciness--I think their 6 is more a 7 or 8 at other Thai restaurants so choose the number with care.  I didn't need any more spice even though I usually order a level of 8 at other places.\u000a\u000aI had the Thai coffee which I liked a lot.  The only thing that detracted from dinner was that the dishes were a bit heavy with salt.  That's unusual for me to say, because I am a serial salter.\u000a\u000aService was excellent!  The waitress was very helpful, cheerful, and she was a pleasure to talk with.  She gave us coupons for a return visit just in case we didn't get another Restaurant.com certificate.  \u000a\u000aWhile it is out of the way for us, I won't hesitate to return and I'm going to suggest our hiking group stop there for lunch the next time we decide to treat ourselves.  The lunch specials are priced well and sound great!

VThis is a lovely park that I've driven by but never stopped at until today when I went to the Farmer's Market there.  The facilities were very clean and I saw several families having sandwiches and enjoying the late afternoon.\u000a\u000aI also saw the Angel Park Trailhead for bikes and walkers.  Now I know a different way I can ride in this area and be off the sidewalks and away from traffic.\u000a\u000aThis isn't the same as having a picnic at Spring Mountain Ranch, but if you're staying in the city, this would be a fine place to gather your family.

V5 of us met again to try a new restaurant and try different food.  I have had Forte bookmarked for about 2 years but I never seemed to think of this place.  \u000a\u000aWe were seated at two high top tables right as you come in the door.  While we were looking at the menu and talking about other things, we were approached for our order.  We asked her to wait awhile as we kept studying what we wanted.\u000a\u000aWe were soon brought some bread.  They were large round puffs larger and flatter than a doughnut.  There was olive oil on the table and we pulled pieces off the bread to dip in the oil.  It was good.\u000a\u000aOur things started coming out.  The first plate was a shared Spanish "nacho" platter.  It consisted of some chips with thin chorizo slices and topped with a tasty truffle salsa.\u000a\u000aWe were brought two orders of meat pies that were also good.  Next came a dish stuffed baby squid served over Spanish herb rice.  \u000a\u000aWe also ordered each of their specialty breads--a feta cheese stuffed filo dough round and Adjarski Khachapurri, described as traditional Georgian boat shaped bread filled with two types of Georgian styled pickled cheeses and a cracked egg mixed on top (after our photos).  Both were good breads.  It was difficult cutting the Georgian bread with the egg but we managed to mangle it enough that everyone got a chance to try some.  The filo round was easy.  All we had to do was pull a piece of the roll off and dip it in the sour cream if we wanted.  The bread was brought straight from the oven because it was extremely hot.\u000a\u000aWe had two orders of almond stuffed bacon wrapped dates with a sherry reduction.  The dates were OK but I thought they were cooked a bit too much.\u000a\u000aNext came some Easter or spring lamb with some mashed potatoes and some salad.  I didn't think the lamb had much of the lamb flavor I was expecting and it was in a dark sauce.  I guess I'm too used to having lamb rare and not done in a stew manner.  It was extremely tender.\u000a\u000aWe closed out this part of lunch with the Thracian clay pot described on the menu as a "traditional Bulgarian specialty of tomatoes, peppers, onion, feta, Bulgarian style charcuterie, and egg baked in a Bulgarian clay pot.  For me, this was the stand out of our lunch.  it had lots of flavor.  I used some of the spice on the table to give it some extra flavor.  On the table was a spice boat with a small wooden spoon.  The woman told us that it was a mixture of 40 spices with cumin, garlic, salt, and.....  We didn't ask her to continue.\u000a\u000aThen dessert was ordered.  We got some baklava and their biscuit cake.  The biscuit cake was the star!  The menu describes it as "decadent cake layered with honey biscuits, mascarpone, rich chocolate, Lavazza espresso, and a kick of spiced rum topped with walnuts and more chocolate.  Need I write any more?  The baklava was not like I'm used to in how it's made but it was OK.\u000a\u000aI thought the food was pretty good.  I wanted to give the place more stars but the part that held me back was the service.  We had asked at the start not to bring all the dishes out but they just kept coming--not all at once--but close enough together that there wasn't a chance to rest a bit between tastings.  The number of plates and fitting them on our two tables became a bit of an issue.  Instead of giving us clean plates periodically, we had the same ones until the main courses were completed.  We got clean plates for dessert.  We also had to ask twice to get more water.  For such a small place with two servers at least, things should have been done better.  \u000a\u000aI might go back to try one of the other main dishes.  And of course, getting some more biscuit cake should always be foremost in my mind.\u000a\u000aAs always, good company made lunch a much better time!

VI stopped in late last night and tried two of their flavors - cake batter and another I just don't remember.  I didn't see any of the no sugar flavors, but I'll look when I go back.  Lots of good toppings including gently crushed Reese's Pieces.  I was impressed by the fact that the toppings were in bins that had a magnet to keep them open while you scooped the toppings.  A small thing, but very well thought out.\u000a\u000aI had the side patio all to myself.  It just made the stop at Menchie's a very enjoyable one.  This was my first visit to a Menchie's and it was super!    I'll be back.\u000a\u000aPS:  For now, this location only has a promo that if you come back the next day, you get 20% off the second visit.  Not bad.

VWe were headed to the Silverton and I looked on Bucky's website to find a new stop.  I'm glad I picked this one.  It's right on the flight path for McCarran and my friends know I'm an airplane nut.  Sitting on the patio sipping my quad iced espresso was heaven watching the planes coming in for a landing at the airport.\u000a\u000aOur drinks were made perfectly and there is a large patio area.  That was good yesterday because someone had the inside thermostat set for keeping meat frozen.  Damn it was cold inside.\u000a\u000aThe staff was polite and friendly and it was a good stop.

VI've been to the Hollywood Theatre several times for different shows.  Last night I was here to the Mike Tyson:  Undisputed Truth.\u000a\u000aI like this venue a lot.  It's small enough that almost any seat is a good one.  It's also located not too far from the main entrance and valet parking.\u000a\u000aSeating alternated between rows of small round tables with four chairs and long tables facing the stage that accommodates four people.  I was in the second row, the first of the long tables and it was a great place to sit.\u000a\u000aMy only complaint is the huge markup if you buy a drink--even a bottle of water.   It's best to bring in a bottle of water from the casino in your pocket and drink that. \u000a\u000aI'll be back for another show, I'm sure!

VI enjoyed part of this show, but then I felt like I was watching something like the movie "Groundhog Day."  They dance well, the music was fine, and the sets with the great lighting wowed me.  Then things got stale.  I felt that I was seeing the same dance again and again and again.  How many times can you jump on one hand while turning without it becoming stale.\u000a\u000aThere was one irritating thing from one of the crew.  I was in the first row of the rear orchestra.  Unfortunately, one of the sound booth guys decided to stand periodically, and his head was right in the way of the people in my area.  He stood near the end for about 4 minutes while he waited for another tech to come back to the booth.\u000a\u000aIt was one of the longest 90 minute shows I've ever seen.

VI have been at this park several times usually riding my bike on the way through.  I did take the time this morning to stop and sit in the shade near the bush maze on the east side that Ken mentions in his review.\u000a\u000aThe dogs in this park are certainly plentiful, but when I'm coming with my bike, they tend to move out of the way so Fluffy doesn't get clipped.\u000a\u000aThe park has so much to offer.  It's a super space in the Gardens neighborhood of Summerlin.

VI have been to Chill twice now and I really like their yogurt.  There is a wide selection of toppings.  The shop is very modern and inviting.  There are three or so tables inside and three on the outdoor patio area.\u000a\u000aThe staff is always very friendly, and they are eager to help.  \u000a\u000aThis is a good stop for anyone who is jonesing for yogurt.

VI often bike through this park.  It has been a great asset to Summerlin.  Like all Summerlin parks, this one is taken care of very well by the landscapers who mow the grass, trim the palm trees, and keep the watering on schedule.  In cooler months, there are often soccer games going into the late evening under the lighted fields.\u000a\u000aI have also been to the park many times for special events.  This is the home of the Summerlin Arts Festival.  It's a nice place to bring a coffee and pastry and sit and enjoy the view of the sandstone cliffs of Red Rock Canyon and the limestone mountains that make up this section of the Spring Mountains.\u000a\u000aWhen Summerlin builds out the Summerlin Centre area and finishes the mall, this park will most likely earn a 5th star because it will be a sea of tranquility among the bustling of traffic going to/from the mall.

VI'm going to United Blood Services to give platelets this afternoon and I needed to stop after an appointment for breakfast.  When I passed Angel Park Golf Club on the way to the appointment, I realized I could go there on the way home.  \u000a\u000aThere was only one other table occupied, so this was a slow morning for them compared to how crowded it is on weekends.  I ordered the Salsa Verde skillet which is described this way on their menu--Spicy chorizo sausage and home fries with melted cheddar and Monterey jack cheese smothered with our homemade Salsa Verde, topped with two eggs any style and flour tortillas.\u000a\u000aI passed on the tortillas and had rye toast instead.  The skillet was very good!  The home fries were very hot with lots of cheese on them.  The salsa verde and the chorizo went well with the potatoes to make a super skillet.  I had coffee with my breakfast.\u000a\u000aService was excellent--it should be with the lack of people.  I had the feeling that my server would have been very attentive on a busier day, too!\u000a\u000aThe views toward the Las Vegas mountain range with Gass Peak in the distance and the plantings and waterfalls at the course make for a pretty setting.  I'm going to come back in the spring when it's warmer and eat on the patio.  That will be grand!

VI decided to give this new store a go last night.  When I got there at 8:45, it was closed.  I guess it must have been cleaning night.  There was some light and a worker doing his mopping.\u000a\u000aI returned tonight to see the bright lights shining and customers enjoying their yogurt.  I had Reese's Peanut Butter and Cookies and Cream.  There are 12 flavors to choose from, some tart, and some others to try I haven't seen as often.  I do need to try the Orange Cream, but it wouldn't have gone well with my other flavors.  There are an abundance of toppings, both fresh fruit and the candies.  I did not see mochi, so Tony, you may be disappointed.  (look at the business answer below - I was wrong!!)\u000a\u000aI was prepared to give the store 4 stars.  Then I saw on one of their flat panel displays that change messages, a sign saying "People Love us on Yelp."  How could I not give them the extra star?\u000a\u000aNice bar stools along the window, a nice round conversation pit like seating in the center, and some tables make it an inviting place.  Price of yogurt is $.39 per ounce so it's on the pricier side.   They do have a loyalty card for repeated visits. Purchase 7, 10 ounce yogurts and get the 8th, 10 ounce yogurt free.\u000a\u000aGive Cherry On Top a try!  \u000a\u000aReview edited to correct errors.

VThis was my first time here.  I had no coffee.  Wow, that really doesn't sound like me.  I was here for the Yelp Book Club gathering in the upstairs lounge area.\u000a\u000aThe facilities are good, and I would give 5 stars for the night, but for the noise that rose from below and interfered at times with hearing the authors.\u000a\u000aI did buy some macarons as I left, tried one on the way home, and I rate is superb!  I will be back.\u000a\u000aFree wifi on the receipt when you purchase something.

VThis would  normally be a 3 star review--A-OK--but the service we received takes the review to four stars and well deserved.\u000a\u000aOur group came here after an Unofficial Yelp Event at Red Rock Canyon.  They set up for 10 because we weren't sure how many were coming.  We ended up with 8 so the set up was perfect.\u000a\u000aDrink orders were taken quickly.  We must have looked like we could use rehydration after the 4.5 mile hike.  Refills were always quick to come.  My iced tea was refilled 3 times and our server brought two of us a glass with extra ice as our ice started melting.\u000a\u000aFor food, I ordered from their lunch pick two menu.  I got the turkey club with a bowl of clam chowder.  The club sandwich was good.  Each quarter had a piece of avocado which added to the flavor.  There were a lot of clams in the chowder.  It was enjoyable also.\u000a\u000aThe service.  Tina, our server, was simply top notch at what she does and that's the reason for the 4th star.  She was always around refilling drinks, checking on whether or not someone needed anything, and generally keeping the best care for us she could.  She also had an instinct of some kind such that she gave us individual checks without asking if it was one check or separate.  That's SERVICE!  \u000a\u000aI'll be back.  Even though I live about 1/2 mile away, this was the first time I'd been at this Yard House.  Tina and the food won me over!

VMcGhie's has become my go to place for bike repairs.  Today I had a flat rear tire that needed fixing.  They had it repaired and ready to go in 5 minutes.  This is what I've come to expect here.  The repair people do their work quickly and competently.  \u000a\u000aLast year I left my bike here for a tune up, and they had it in almost new shape when I picked it up.  I've always found the staff to be pleasant and helpful.\u000a\u000aI recommend McGhie's for your bike needs.

VThis restaurant just opened 3 days ago, so there were some glitches and service was a bit shaky because there were two people trying to serve the tables and orders were mixed up a bit.  They have both lunch and dinner buffets.  Lunch is $7.99 and dinner is $9.99.  The weekend buffet goes to $11.99 and I don't know if there is anything different to make weekends more expensive.\u000a\u000aI had the buffet and my wife had Saag Chicken.  Her dish was very good.  She asked for it not spicy at all.  There was some spiciness, but she could live with that and it's good that she is growing in her tastes.  The buffet was good except for a major glitch which soon smoothed out.  Something happened to the heated water under the steamers, and some of the food had cooled somewhat before they got it back up to piping hot.  I won't remember all the dishes but they had vegetable samosa, a spicy lentil dish, chana masala, aloo palak, jeera rice, chicken korma, tandoori chicken, chili beef, and gulab jamon.  Except for the temperature issue, the buffet food was quite good.  I tried some dishes I have never had and it was all good.  The gulab jamon was outstanding - the first time I've had this dessert.\u000a\u000aOne issue we had was with an order of garlic nan.  There was no garlic.  There was a mixup in orders.  He deleted the amount from the bill.\u000a\u000aWe will be returning and it's close to home, so I can to take out, too.  \u000a\u000aThe brochure syas they have live music and karaoke Thursday through Sunday.  The owner promised to play something for us, but he got too busy helping out.  This is a small suite in the Village Square Plaza a few doors east of the Regal Cinemas and next door to the Coldstone Creamery store.  Capacity is rated at 65 people, so it's a small place.\u000a\u000aIf you go to their website, you can download their menu as an Excel spreadsheet.

VI try to avoid post offices because of their long lines.  That happened again today, but I was prepared.  I bypassed the line and went to the do-it yourself package meter and was out of here in a matter of minutes.  \u000a\u000aStill, if I can print postage at home and just drop a package off at a nearby mailing center, I'm happier.\u000a\u000aI have to give the Postal Service two thumbs up for adding these machines.

VI have been torn about trying Smashburger since some of the reviews for their locations have been less than smashing.  Last night, we decided to try something different and decided to try Smashburger.\u000a\u000aI looked at the online menu and then went to this location which is near where I live.  I got the avocado club hamburger for myself and the truffle mushroom burger for my wife.  After finding out what Smash fries were, I got an order for each of us.\u000a\u000aSarah was the woman running the register last night and she was good answering my questions.  I'm sure she could tell it was my first time there.  She told me to have a seat and she'd bring the to go order as soon as it was ready.  In about 5 minutes, the order was ready.  Since there was no one else in the restaurant, I knew it was mine.\u000a\u000aA short drive home and we were enjoying the hamburgers.  They were good for a change.  They are somewhere in the middle between normal fast food hamburger chains and the upscale hamburger shops which have sprung up around Las Vegas.  The fries were good.\u000a\u000aI'm not going to make Smashburger a regular on my rotation schedule, but it was good enough that I'll be back sometime.  I need to try the nutter butter shake.

VI waited for the "Finally" sign to be taken down to give this neighborhood place a try.  I drove over tonight, and I was disappointed.  The place is SO bright.  Wow!  It assaults you when you go in from a dark outside.\u000a\u000aI also was struck by the lack of different flavors.  I was ready to try the Red Velvet mentioned in the earlier reviews, but it wasn't on tap.  I was also surprised by the lack of toppings.\u000a\u000aThe yogurt market is certainly a buyers market, and I'll continue buying at Yogels or Chill.  They have a much better selection of everything.

VI decided to go back and give I Love Yogurt another try.  I still don't care for the white interior.  It's a personal taste, and since I don't eat inside that often at any Yogurt place, I can get by this.\u000a\u000aI tried the Red Velvet and Pistachio flavors.  I added three toppings--cookie dough chunks, coconut, and mochi.  I was impressed by  both flavors.  They were very flavorful and creamy.\u000a\u000aMy big problem tonight was there were so many flavors I wanted to try, but I couldn't try all of them.  This means, I'll have to come back.  Since this is about the closest serve yourself frozen yogurt to where I live, I guess that' what I'll have to do.  And, after visiting Pinkberry's in downtown LA this week, I know more than ever why I prefer self-serve rather than we'll do it for you.\u000a\u000aNote to fellow Yelpers:  After 3 check ins here, there's a 25% discount.  I think I'll reach that plateau quickly.  \u000a\u000aI'm glad to see I Love Yogurt has made some changes with their flavors and their operation.

VI like the concept of KGB and it's riff on the Soviet era.  Being at KGB, however, is not like being at the Lubyanka in Moscow.  There are Soviet era knock off posters of the proletariat.  Most of the female servers had short, leather shorts that evoked a police state couture.\u000a\u000aI had a Groupon that was about to expire so I messaged a good Yelp buddy and asked if he wanted to join me here before our Yelp event last night and use the Groupon.  He has been there before but this was my first visit.\u000a\u000aI ordered their southwest burger which the menu describes like this:   avocado, cilantro, lime-marinated peppers and onions, pico de gallo, pepper jack cheese, avocado crème fraîche, jalapeño-Cheddar bun.  I ordered it rare.  The burger comes with fries.  The burger was cooked perfectly and it was very juicy but none of the avocado was there.  Pico, yes, and cheese, but there was no taste of avocado.  \u000a\u000aService was good during our visit.  Since the place was almost empty, it should have been.  The price was in line with Strip prices.  At first I thought the burger was over-priced but when you factor in the fries served with each sandwich, it is comparable to other burger joints on the Strip.\u000a\u000aI went to see the round semi-private dining area on the side of the kitchen where they have the hammer and sickle light.  I got a photo of it and I could almost see Felix Dzerzhinsky having dinner there.  KGB is A-OK!

VI went into the store to buy a new mouse.  The staff at this and all Apple stores are very knowledgeable, quick to serve, and give you all the answers to any questions you may have.\u000a\u000aThis is not normally the Apple Store I'd go to, but I was in the neighborhood, and it filled the need.\u000a\u000aGreat job, staff!

VI went to Firefly when it was in the Plaza quite a few years ago but haven't been to one of their locations since.  We decided to try the West Sahara location last night and am I glad we did!\u000a\u000aWe started with three plates--the Firefly fries, steak and mushroom skewers, and marinated and grilled octopus (pulpo asado).  All three dishes were excellent.  The fries are completely addictive.  You cannot stop eating them.  The have parmesan cheese and herbs on them and a side of aioli for dipping.  I liked them without dipping.  Did I mention they're addictive?  I think the FDA will soon start regulating their distribution and sale.  :)\u000a\u000aWe decided to try two more things because this is tapas.  I ordered the scallops "escargot" for myself and my wife got the ham and cheese croquetas.  Both were winners all the way.  The butter/garlic/herbs with the scallops fooled one into thinking they were having real escargots.  The ham and cheese deep fried croquetas were really tasty and the aioli on them was super.\u000a\u000aFinally, we ordered some dessert.  My wife got the chocolate and cherry bread pudding with a scoop of ice cream and I ordered the banana-Nutella sandwiches.  The sandwiches had mashed bananas inside and Nutella drizzled on top and there was a small side container of more Nutella.  Absolutely delightful!!!\u000a\u000aOur server was Joshua and he was top notch!  He answered questions we had, recommended some things when we asked, and he always saw to it that we had new glasses of iced tea before we finished the ones we had.  It seemed like everyone in the place was very customer oriented and we felt welcomed and appreciated!\u000a\u000aI will be back to try some more of their goodies.  But, this time I'll skip the fires.  As addictive as they are, they can also be very filling and you just cannot stop eating them.  I was waiting for my wife to say, "Put the fries down and put your arms up."\u000a\u000a5 stars for a place with great food and service to match.  And, 5 stars to a place where my wife tries a piece of octopus and actually likes it!  Miracles do happen!

VI had a comp ticket for the show last night.  It's in the Donny and Marie Theatre.  The line to get in was very long, but it moved along quickly.  You stop at the obligatory tourist photo area (I politely declined and I got through without having to pose for a goofy photo I wouldn't buy anyway).\u000a\u000aOnce to the podium in the theatre, an usher asked if I was alone.  When I answered yes, he said, "Walk this way."  No he really didn't but Marty Feldman did.  The usher took me to the front row by the stage stairs.  He took out a felt marker and initialed my ticket and told me to enjoy the show.  Score!  I stopped to see him on the way out.\u000a\u000aThe show began promptly at 9:30 and what followed was a 75 minute show that featured 4 impersonators of famous entertainers.  First up was Cher.  The woman who did this was very good, the best of the four this evening.  When she opened with Gypsies, Tramps, and Thieves she had me from the get go.  Then Half Breed.  Hell, I was in heaven by now.  She not only sounded good, she looked the part, too!  There was audience participation on stage for one poor guy who was a good sport and had fun clowning and singing with her.  I'm glad I don't fit the stereotype she might be looking for to join her on stage.  Besides, I do my scowl well.  It's been practiced enough!\u000a\u000aNext up was the Michael Jackson impersonator.  He was just OK.  His dance and body moves were much better than his vocal impersonation.  The two better numbers he did were Thriller and Billie Jean.  \u000a\u000aNext up was the Tina Turner impersonator.  She was the weakest in the lineup last night.  I don't think she sounded like Turner at all.  She mangled Proud Mary as far as I was concerned.  I was glad when her numbers were over.\u000a\u000aLast came Elvis.  I guess an impersonator show in Las Vegas wouldn't be complete without the King!  This guy was OK.  However, we have so many Elvis impersonators in Las Vegas that many of them would outshine this guy.  He did a credible job but he really had a baby face.  He redeemed himself somewhat in the finale when he did Viva Las Vegas.  How can I knock him too much?\u000a\u000aThe back up singers and dancers were good.  The choreography could be better.  It looks perfunctory at times,  The three dressed in showgirl outfits with head dresses for the Viva Las Vegas number were top notch.\u000a\u000aBacking up the group was a 5 piece band that had a great sound.  They played well and it made the vocals better.\u000a\u000aAll in all, not a bad show and a nice diversion for a tourist who wants to leave the tables or machines for a break.

VI was going to a program and eating out so I had to get a quick meal for my wife at home.  Subway--about a mile away.\u000a\u000aIt's been a long while since I was here.  I ordered the BMT for her on Italian herbs and cheese bread.  I had them add a small amount of lettuce, tomatoes, and some red onion and mayo.  That was it.  I was done and even though they had a large order ahead of me, I was in and out pretty quickly.  The price was right and I was off the hook for cooking something.\u000a\u000aI'm happy to report my wife thought the sandwich was very good and she'd like to go to Subway now and then instead of the other place we've been going that has a red truck theme.

VI went to Brad Garrett's Comedy Club last night.  This was the second time I've been to one of the shows since it opened about a month ago.  The club is several notches above other comedy clubs I've been to in town.\u000a\u000aAmbiance - I really like this showroom.  This was Rodney Dangerfield's room at the Trop.  The room is dark and it is a perfect size for a comedy club.  10 to 15 minutes before the show starts, a pianist plays and sings which is a great idea.  There is a bar at the back of the room, and cocktail service is available.  I like that the pianist plays a number or two between the two comedians.  This gives people a chance to go to the bar or bathroom and it really cuts down on the number of people who get up and leave during a performance.\u000a\u000aComedy - I have been to several clubs in town, but as I said earlier, this is better than the others.  The two shows I saw, one featuring Bob Zany and last night's with Butch Bradley, show that the talent of the comedians is superior to that of the other clubs.  Perhaps it's because Garrett knows comedy and books top comedians.  Garrett is not in the show each night.  He makes appearances about once a month.\u000a\u000aOverall - I will be coming back to see more shows.  The room, the nice touches such as the pianist, and the first class comics makes this an easy choice.  \u000a\u000aPrice - $39 for general admission, $59 for VIP tickets.  Adding taxes and service fees to these amounts will bring the total up by $3 or so dollars.

VI came back for another show, and the club is as good as before.  The comics are head and shoulders better than other comedy clubs I've been to.  Last night, the headliner was Mike Marino with an opening act by Jimmy Burns.  Both were very, very good!\u000a\u000aThere were a couple of changes.  Bobby C. was at the piano again last night, but the piano interlude between comics has ended. Maybe it's to move the show along and get the people out earlier.  This time, they have gone to having a guest host.  This was the case the first time I came here, but not the second.  Now it's back.  Rob Sherwood, a local standup comedian, acts as host introducing the two comics and closing the show.  \u000a\u000aService in the showroom is excellent.  I would have given the 5th star if they had maintained the excellent piano entertainment of Bobby C.  between comics.\u000a\u000aI bought my ticket last night to see Garrett in mid-September.  He has reduced his own price to the regular pricing rather than having a $20 higher price for his gigs.\u000a\u000aThis is still THE comedy club in Las Vegas.

VI stopped into the Greenland Market, saw the Tiffany Coffee sign and stopped before I left the plaza,\u000a\u000aI got a raspberry-banana smoothie with boba.  Really good tasting with so much fresh banana flavor.\u000a\u000aI'll take Elnino's advice and get the smoothie with milk the next time.  If it's better than what I am drinking now, then wow, it will be great!  Also need to try Misti's sweet potato latte.\u000a\u000aI wish I knew this was there and had read the reviews before I went there.

VThe Nevada Conservatory Theatre at UNLV is an excellent place for those who enjoy live theatre, great performances, and a venue away from the Strip and the hubbub there.  \u000a\u000aI have been a season ticket holder for 3 years getting ready for the 4th year in September.  Sure there were some plays that weren't as enjoyable as others.  But, most have been top notch, showcasing the talent in the fine arts programs at UNLV.\u000a\u000aThe new season brings the plays Fool For Love, Count Dracula, The Fantasticks, Summers of Fear, and Noises Off.  In addition, there are three Black Box productions The Hot L Baltimore, Spring's Awakening, and Trojan Women.  These will be in the Judy Bayley Theatre.\u000a\u000aGo see one of these shows and perhaps get hooked.  I know, I did!

VThis is an old Kmart and it looks rundown from the outside.  I needed to get some shower soap for my wife and the Kmart was across the street from United Nissan where I was having my car serviced.\u000a\u000aTo my surprise, the inside of the store was just like any other Kmart.  It's old but it was clean and well stocked.  I found what I needed, walked to a register, and was out of the store in about 5 minutes.  The cashier was pleasant and it was an OK experience.\u000a\u000aI certainly wouldn't go to the other side of the valley to shop here, but if I am in the area and need something, I'll remember this place.

VI came by today to get a few photos to post on Yelp.  A voice sounding much like Misti's said, "Well you've come this far.  You might as well have something so you can review the place, too!" \u000a\u000aI know, it's a heck of a job, but someone's got to do it.  I forced myself to enter the restaurant, perused the menu for quite awhile, and then decided to try the Hazelnut Cream Chocolate Milkshake made with vanilla bourbon ice cream, dark chocolate truffle, and topped with whipped cream.\u000a\u000aIt was served in an "Alice" mug that says, "Drink Me," a signature mug of the bald man.  It comes from a statement in Alice in Wonderland when she found a little bottle with a paper label that said, "Drink me."\u000a\u000aThe milkshake was outstanding if a bit pricey - $7.95.  The restaurant is quite nice, and the employees were just excellent - smiles all around and very helpful.  I also bought a tin of caramelized pecans rolled in praline cream and cocoa powder for later nourishment.  Take one as needed.\u000a\u000aI want to come back when I have a late lunch/early dinner and try some of the food offerings.  It's quite a nice place.

VI stopped at Blizz last night before the Kathy Griffin show at the Mirage.  It's very handy and the frozen yogurt is quite good.  I did a mixture of peanut butter and coconut and put some toppings on.  \u000a\u000aThe problem with this outlet is you're paying Strip prices ($.69) an ounce.  Blizz is more expensive than other yogurt shops, but this is over the top.  In spite of the cost, the yogurt was very good,  The people running the register were quite efficient and friendly.\u000a\u000aThe location was very clean and bright.  I was surprised by the lack of flavors.  Most yogurt places have two or four more flavors.  This seemed to be lacking.  The same goes for the toppings although they did have some I hadn't seen at other places.\u000a\u000aHaving had a late lunch, this was a perfect dinner.

VI first visited Las Vegas in 1972 and I came back for vacation almost every year until I moved here in 2001.  I love this crazy, wonderful, bright light city and its history.\u000a\u000aThere are so many things to do within a short drive of Las Vegas.  We have several National Recreation areas, two National Conservation areas, theatre, entertainment venues at Strip hotels, and all the other activities that go with a city of nearly 2,000,000 people.  How many places can you snow ski in the morning and water ski that same day?\u000a\u000aMany thanks to the deceased first lady of Las Vegas, Helen Stewart.  If she hadn't kept her family together and stayed here after her husband's murder at the Kiel Ranch, the railroad probably would have passed us by and the city wouldn't exist as it does today.  Instead, she sold the Las Vegas Ranch to the railroad and that started us out.  From there, laws--mainly gambling-- and then the building of Hoover Dam helped bring this city toward the future it has.\u000a\u000aAnd it's still growing.  Bright light city--you have set my soul on fire!

VI have heard about the Magical Forest for years and I never went.  I got a ticket for the Forest at this year's Great Las Vegas Santa Run and decided this was something I had to check out.\u000a\u000aI went two nights ago at 8 PM--time for the youngest ones to be home or on their way home.  It was a cold night and attendance was small.  I have seen video on the news of the Forest, but it has so much more impact when you're there in person.\u000a\u000aI did a slow walk around the grounds and enjoyed the lights, the music, the creativity of the displays, and of course, the people watching.  Everyone seemed to be in a great mood, almost festive, and this added to the enjoyment.\u000a\u000aI will be returning next year as I put this on my list of to do things for the holidays.  It certainly is a nice way to spend some time enjoying the lights and the other decorations and the proceeds go to a great cause--Opportunity Village.

VI really liked my dinner here last night.   I have not been in the restaurant since it was the Via Veneto years ago.  I decided to give it a try after getting a coupon from Suncoast marketing.\u000a\u000aI was immediately taken by the change in customer service when I arrived.  The hostess asked me if I wanted a table or booth.  Both of these seat 4 people.  I glanced toward the small bar area and saw small, high top bar tables, and I asked if I could sit there because I was alone.  I was told I could wherever I wanted and she escorted me to a table there.  There is a high cushioned bench running along the wall.  Once you get up on the bench, there's a raised platform for your feet so you can be very comfortable at these tables.\u000a\u000aTami, the bartender, took my order and checked on me after every course was delivered to see if there was anything she could do and to see if I was satisfied with my meal. \u000a\u000aWhen ordering, I asked if the soups were cups or bowls.  Being told they were bowls, Tami then said, "But we can do a cup of soup for you."  I ordered the Italian wedding soup that I haven't had in a long time.  For the main course, I chose the veal picatta.   And, they give you choice.  You don't have to take pasta with every entree.  I opted for vegetables that included some roasted potatoes.  That's what I mean by the change in customer service.\u000a\u000aDessert was a tough one.  There were so many choices I wanted to stay for a few desserts. I decided on the classic mud pie, and it was great!  Cookie crumb crust, at least 3 inches high with coffee ice cream, drizzled with chocolate, and accompanied with some fresh strawberries and a raspberry and blueberry.  \u000a\u000aI think it was a bit pricey as others have mentioned.  I was quite pleased with the taste of the food and the service was the best!  I will be back, this time with company.

VI used to go here when it was Denny's and I have driven by many times since it became the Mega Cafe.  Ken M;s review really made me want to come a try the white chocolate raspberry French toast.  \u000a\u000aIt was very good.  I can't say I tasted much chocolate, but the raspberry flavor came through.  It seems like the bread is injected with the raspberry flavoring, but I'm not sure of that.\u000a\u000aYou can get the platter which is a full serving of French Toast plus 3 eggs and 3 slices of bacon or 3 pieces of sausage.  You can get just the French Toast, or you can get a half order of the French Toast.  I got the half order which was 2 slices of bread cut in halves.  Very nice breakfast and more than enough.\u000a\u000aI give it an extra star for the prompt and courteous service.  I also found out that it's the same owners who had Denny's.  Different franchise, evidently.

VThe last stop on the Taco Trek for our group.  This place also has an al pastor wheel but I got a carne asada taco Azteca style which means it comes with a fresh grilled cactus pad.  I love cactus can this was super good!  Also, you can get at no extra charge, grilled vegetables to go with your taco.  When I saw it consisted of grilled scallions and two grilled peppers--one a jalapeño, I had to get the veggies.\u000a\u000aThe taco was very tasty and I ate the onions and peppers almost as a side dish.  Another thing different about El Gordo is that you can get either flour or corn tacos.  I got the corn this time and it was quite flavorful.  The tacos here are smaller than at the other places we stopped, but they are good and worth the price with the vegetable dish.  At $2, the place is on par with the other taco places in the area.\u000a\u000aA little difference with this place is that you pick up a tray and place your ordered dishes on it.  Then you go to the cashier and pay for what you ordered.  It's very much cafeteria style.  Last night was quite busy and when our group arrived, we got a lot of stares.\u000a\u000aA good stop of the Taco Trek!

VThis is a two and a half hour "tour" that begins at the Royal Resort on Convention Center Drive, and it covers much of the history of Las Vegas when the Mob had tremendous influence and controlled much.\u000a\u000aMuch of the tour consists of sitting on the bus in the shade of some buildings while the tour director describes mob activities and shows photos and video on the flat panel at the front of the bus.  The first talk was about 15 minutes as we sat in the shade of the buildings west of the Royal Resort.  We then took a circuitous route down Convention Center Drive, made a left on Paradise, went to Sahara where we made a right, turned right on Joe W. Brown and then parked in the shade of the Las Vegas Hilton near its Sports Book entrance.  From there we went back down Joe W. to karen to Maryland to Sahara to Tony Roma's where Frank Rosenthal survived a car bombing attempt on October 4, 1982.  See what I mean about how the "tour" goes.  For a local, it was awful to see the roundabout way we were going.  As a tourist, I might not have noticed.\u000a\u000aThe material offered during the tour is excellent.  There just isn't enough to see on the tour.  The only place we got out of the bus and toured anything was the last place, the Flamingo Hotel, where we walked to Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel's Garden.  Now that I know where it is I'll be back to see it in daylight.\u000a\u000aWe were fortunate to have as our narrator Dennis Griffin, the author of several books.  He has a lot of knowledge.\u000a\u000aI'm glad I had a Groupon for this experience.

VWe decided to have something different last night and tried the Tropical Smoothie Cafe in Village Square at Peccole Ranch.  We got a pamphlet in our door a week or so ago, and the menu looked interesting.\u000a\u000aI had the Jamaican Jerk Chicken wrap and my wife had the King Caesar wrap.  I had a Hawaiian Breeze Smoothie with my meal.  \u000a\u000aThe wraps were very tasty and the price was good.  They have a special of two wraps for $9.99.  \u000a\u000aThis made a quick take out stop for an early dinner I had to have before meeting s friend near the Strip. I'll return.  There are other things on the menu that need trying and this is a good alternative for fast food.

VI have been a member of the VMLSC for the last 8 years.  The rates are good, the facilities are generally well maintained, and the amount of equipment is adequate for the number of members.\u000a\u000aThis is not a gym for everyone.  The hours are not convenient for a 24 hour town.  Their hours are:   Monday to Thursday, 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Friday, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.; and Saturday 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.  They are closed on Sunday.  They used to open at 6 AM and they were open on Sundays, but budget cuts and staff reductions have forced shorter hours.\u000a\u000aIf your schedule fits these times, it's a great place to go.  The people who go there vary in age - well maybe there are a few more retired people than the 30s range, but it a nice group.\u000a\u000aThere are tow main rooms for most people - the fitness room and the weight room.  The fitness room has 8 treadmills, 2 stair steppers, 4 ellipticals, and 4 stationary bikes.  The weight room has a nice variety of weight training equipment and there is a good collection of free weights.\u000a\u000aIn addition to these two areas, the facility has larger rooms where yoga classes and dance classes are held.  There is a standard gymnasium where we play paddle tennis several days a week.\u000a\u000aWhile this place may not be for all, it's a great little gym to join and enjoy.\u000a\u000aThe photos I've included do not show the fitness nor weight rooms.  Older people with larger girth tend to get a tad cranky when you take their photos with sweat and all from exercising.

VThis is a review for the Star Theatre in the Clarion Hotel.  The showroom was once used by Debbie Reynolds when she owned the casino .  SInce that time, there have been a number of ownership changes, but the theatre has remained. \u000a\u000aWho would guess this gem of a venue would be at the opposite end of the property from the front desk?  Tonight I went to see Russell Thompkins Jr. and the New Stylistics.  The show was great, and this theatre is a wonderful place for a small show like this - a 10 piece band and 3 singers.\u000a\u000aThere are a number of shows in the Clarion that rotate use of the theatre.  There's also a second, smaller theatre, that I believe was once a meeting room.\u000a\u000aThe property has a very small casino - about 30 machines (?) and it's a bit run down, but then, I don't go there for the slots.

VI stopped in for breakfast this morning on the way to the Las Vegas Great Santa Run and I was glad I did.  I ordered the lemon, blueberry pancakes.  Coffee was brought quickly and refilled without me asking for it.\u000a\u000aThe breakfast was ready quickly and it was delivered hot.  The lemon flavor along with the blueberries in the batter made for a nice combination.  I did not make a combo of my breakfast.  For $2.99 more, you can get two eggs and bacon or sausage.  That would have been too much breakfast for me.\u000a\u000aI read the reviews on Yelp before going here and a few mention cleanliness.  That's something that's apparently not a problem anymore.  The floor was spotless except for some foot prints at the door and the tables were clean.\u000a\u000aThis is a very pleasant, small place.  I'd come back again.

VThis review is for a volunteer recognition breakfast that I attended on 11/5/11 in Banquet Room B on the second floor.\u000a\u000aThe room is very well decorated in red, of course, for UNLV.  The staff was attentive to making sure the coffee and food items were always available without running out.\u000a\u000aAs for the food, it was done by UNLV Catering and it was as good as buffet banquet breakfasts can be.  The scrambled eggs were a bit watery, but everything else was cooked well.\u000a\u000aParking on a Saturday was fine.  I know how difficult it is for students during the week.\u000a\u000aMy visit here was a positive experience and I could only look at the Student Union and wonder if I would have enjoyed such a nice place if I had gone to college at a bigger school than I did.

VBased on the reviews here, I decided to try Born and Raised for breakfast before the Great Santa Run 2010 at Town Square.  I'm glad I listen to my fellow Yelpers, because they've nailed this place well!\u000a\u000aI was the only customer when I walked in at 7:30 AM and the staff was great.  They let me seat myself anywhere I wanted.  I chose a table in the lunge so I could watch the 17 or so big screen TVs.  Two channel sof ESPN were on, two screens of Chelsea footie, and 5 screens of the History Channel which seemed out of place in a video poker/sports bar.  \u000a\u000aThe important stuff - breakfast was great.  I had their Eggs Benedict.  They were tasty, and the Hollandaise had a nice, distinct flavor.  The breakfasts come with BAR potatoes and a nice bowl of fresh fruit.  My only detraction was my eggs were poached more than I like them, but that may be a health code because of possible salmonella.\u000a\u000aThe breakfast is listed on the menu for $9 and that's what the bill was for plus the tax.  No charge for coffee - it comes with the meal.  That's almost unheard of anymore!\u000a\u000aI'll return.  This is a gem of a place.  It only opened in October.  I wish them well.  I'll come back and try their sliders.

VI decided to hit Crystals today to see how it's halls were decked for Christmas.  After the short look, I made my way to Pods for my first visit.  I only wanted a drink and something sweet.  I got a large pomegranate iced tea and a dark chocolate chip cookie.\u000a\u000aThe iced tea was very good.  The pomegranate syrup was not sweetened so the drink wasn't a sweet tea mess.  It had a lovely taste with the pomegranate giving the tea a bit of a tart flavor.  The dark chocolate chip cookie was superb!  It had a very rich chocolate flavor, a flavor that avoided sweetness and let the rich chocolate shine through.\u000a\u000aTotal cost was just under $8, a bit much for iced tea and a cookie (even though the cookie was a good size.)  I enjoyed sitting on a tall stool at a table watching the few people go by.\u000a\u000aThe Pods is a nice enough place.  There's just no reason to return often.  It's not like it's Jean Philippe after all.

VThis place has so much promise, but it fell short.  I had a Groupon I bought before I read the Yelp reviews.  Live and learn!\u000a\u000aI asked my server, who was quite good, what recommendation he would have between the 8 oz filet and the macadamia nut encrusted sea bass. He recommended the sea bass and that's what I ordered.  The plating was done nicely, but I do have a dislike for things piled on top of each other.  If I want my beans and potatoes mixed, I'll do it myself.\u000a\u000aA couple of things to note:  The macadamia nut crust was so finely chopped that it was impossible to get a taste of macadamia.  A little more coarse chop, please;  second, the fish was moist and tasty, but I don't think it was sea bass--at least like no other sea bass I've had.  It had more of a look, texture, and taste of haddock.  Was this a substitution?  Last, there was a bone in the fish.  Now I know, fish have bones.  But, for a moment I felt like Geoffrey Zakarian or Alex Guarnaschelli on Chopped and I wanted to turn up my nose and say the chef needed to be chopped.  Redeeming feature follows.\u000a\u000aThe dessert of Mud Pie was superb!  I should have had this for dinner and skipped the fish.  The chocolate ice cream with the cookie crumb crust was heavenly.  The other redemption came in the form of my server.  When informed I was using a Groupon, he told me approximately how much I had used and suggested ordering more to get the full value.  Now, that's service!\u000a\u000aI'm not sure if I'd return here.  I think I know now why the other places all had a lot of folks and this relatively large restaurant had few diners.

VI thoroughly enjoyed the show the two times I saw it.  This is one of the shows that if you're into the premise of the show, you have a smile from the time you get your metal "instrument" and drum stick until the end of the show.\u000a\u000aAfter being given a drum stick, I was told to choose any item from one of four boxes.  That was what I banged on with the stick many times during the show.  It was great fun and it certainly gets rid of tension you may have.  You just smile and hit away.\u000a\u000aThe group is very talented with their drumming.  I was really impressed with the opening, and I was impressed with the talent of these guys.\u000a\u000aA few months after I saw the show the first time, I had the chance to go again and I took my wife and two friends.  The vote was 3 to 1.  My wife was not fond of the show because of the loudness so if that's an issue for you, it might be better if you skip this show.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, if you want to relive some of the things you did as a kid, by all means, go and see this show and enjoy and jus smile.

VI go here often to get their sugar free dark chocolate bars.  They are outstanding.  The staff is always very pleasant, and I'm always given a free sample before i leave.\u000a\u000aA tip for saving some money - go to Costco and buy the double back of See's Candies gift certificates.  They are are worth about $3 more at See's than what you pay Costco.

VI had the chance to have lunch and take a tour of the Vegas PBS Educational Technology Campus yesterday and the pace is amazing.  This is the most green PBS building in the US--LEED Gold.  The technology involved in the building is fascinating.  A concrete parking lot instead of blacktop to reflect the sun and keep the area cooler.  Medium sized mesh metal screens about 2 feet away from the window glass.  This allows lots of light to come through, but keeps the rays from heating the glass and making cooling of the building harder.  Louvers on the windows to reflect sun away from the building--at an angle specifically placed for this latitude--again allowing light through but helping keep the building cooler.\u000a\u000aThe building is divided into two sections.  One side is the Clark County School District's Educational Media Services (EMS), Vegas Virtual Online Education and Clark County School District's Virtual High School.  The other half of the building is for the Vegas PBS studios and their support for various community programs.  There's also a section on the PBS side that has a computer center that has all the blueprints for every public school in Clark County so emergency personnel could access that information in a crisis.  It's a fascinating set up.\u000a\u000aThe building was designed to withstand a magnitude 6 or 7 earthquake that comes along every 10,000 years or so in Las Vegas.  The studio side is built in four distinct parts and the stairs all have reinforced cables attached in several directions.  All this is one reason why it took 10 years to plan, design, and raise the money to build and complete the facility.  It is fascinating!\u000a\u000aFinally, we got into the studios.  It's one large area with several sets for different programs that originate from Vegas PBS.  We then went into the control room where all of this comes together and saw the adjacent sound room.\u000a\u000aWhenever I watch programs on PBS, I'll remember the tour and it will bring back memories of where the program originates.  \u000a\u000aVegas PBS is outstanding both for the services to the Clark County School District and for its programming.  Great tour, Tom!  Thanks!

VI came to see a play last night, and I was very pleased with the facility.  Parking was easy and I didn't have too far to walk.  There are concessions and bathrooms near the box office so you can see get your snack fix if you want.\u000a\u000aBeing 95+ degrees when the show started at 7 PM, it was a little warm because the overhead canopy tends to keep the heat in longer rather than dissipating when the sun went down.\u000a\u000aOn the west side of the facility, there's an elevator for people who need to avoid steps.\u000a\u000aThe staff was very friendly and helpful and I was in my seat in no time.  This is a very nice venue and I will be back!

VThis place could easily be a 4 or 4.5 star restaurant but it was an accumulation of little things that made me subtract the star and a half.  First, when I got to the podium, there was no one around.  Immediately behind me at the bar were 3 employees.  They all saw me, yet not one said a word--not so much as a "someone will be right there" or "let me go get someone."  Nothing, nada!  Several minutes went by and a woman appeared from a door which turned out to be the kitchen.  She then seated me.  Little thing #1.\u000a\u000aI had a Groupon and she asked to see it.  When I loaded it on my iPhone she stated she wasn't sure they were doing it that way.  They wanted a paper printout.  At that point I was ready to leave so she said she'd talk to the manager.  He agreed to take the Groupon number if they could copy my ID.  What?  Little thing #2.\u000a\u000aThere are 6 entrees on the dinner menu and 6 items on the dessert menu.  They forgot one item from my steak and they were out of bananas for the dessert.  Their banana supplier had not yet been there.  Little thing getting bigger #3.\u000a\u000aCharge for a second iced tea at $3.  It was a partial refill. I had 1/3 left when she asked if I wanted more.  Bigger little thing #4.\u000a\u000aNow for the meal--it was superb!  I got the 8 ounce filet which was on a bed of garlic-onion mashed potatoes (the menu says puree, but it isn't).  There were 5 stalks of grilled asparagus for the seasonal vegetable (they were perfect!), and the drizzled Port syrup was very tasty.  The crispy tater strings were forgotten or maybe they hadn't been delivered yet, either.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I had the Gossip Sundae--green tea ice cream on powdered crispy wontons with butter rum caramel sauce, caramelized bananas, and walnuts.  Of course, the bananas were missing.\u000a\u000aPlating for the entree and dessert were nicely done.  I looked at some of the photos for the restaurant to see what I should have gotten.  I sure wish they had gotten their delivery!\u000a\u000aI'm not sure if I'll give Addiction another chance.  It is good, but there are too many little things that just add up to a subtraction in the enjoyment of the meal.

VAs I was going to get my parking ticket validated, I walked past this little shop just off the check in area almost across from the elevators.  Oh, what a lovely discovery.  They have luscious looking candy, gelato, cupcakes, and several other kinds of goodies available for the person on the go and in the know.\u000a\u000aI perused the cases before deciding to buy one lemon cupcake and one red velvet cupcake.  They are $3.00 each.  They put them in little boxes with wire holders--much like you get rice for take out.  I was going to show you photos of the cupcakes.  However, they sat in the back of my warm car for three hours, and then they got jostled a tad as I drove them home with several stops on the way.  You'll have to be content to read my review.  The cupcakes were excellent.  They were moist and the frosting was excellent--perhaps a bit sweet, but it was what I was in the mood for.\u000a\u000aIn the heat, the icing tended to flow over the sides.  Oh the hell of getting cupcakes to where you want them in the dessert.  If you're in the area of the GN, I'd certainly give this place a try.

VI can give this the best rating without even thinking about it.  I met a friend from Arizona at Babycakes this morning for a breakfast of Red Velvet pancakes.  We each got the short stack.  The three cakes come with a dollop of whipped cream and a container of liquid cream cheese.  I thought I detected a slight vanilla flavor in the cream cheese.  It was divine!  There was also a sprinkling of mini chocolate pieces that melted from the warmth of the pancakes!\u000a\u000aI had coffee and my friend had Coke.  Service was wonderful!  Our server had a great smile and was right on top of everything.  I had a coffee refill almost before I knew I wanted one.\u000a\u000aI will be back to try some other items on the menu.  Being able to go on weekdays lessens the worry about waiting although we met at 8:30 and the place was almost filled - it is small - before 9.

VThis was a quick stop last night to a later open Starbuck's that the neighborhood stores.  It was clean, service was quick, and the drink was exactly right.  I've been here before, and I'll be back.

VSpotted Leaf Park is one of the two large ones in the Willows village of Summerlin.  There are two lighted tennis courts, a play area for children, and two lighted soccer fields.  A sidewalk runs along the perimeter of the park.  There are also basketball courts and a picnic table area.\u000a\u000aI haven't spent time in the park to speak of.  What I do is ride my bike through the park as I got on my ride.  It's a nice diversion and a pleasant area.\u000a\u000aThe park is not a dual use one so it's level without the depression common to parks that double as flash flood catch basins.  The park's west wall abuts against the sound wall of the 215.

VI am a fan of this small but nicely decorated Thai restaurant.  I was there for the first time--certainly not the last time--Saturday night.  I had the Yelp deal and it worked beautifully.\u000a\u000aI started with the crab stick appetizer.  Here's how the menu describes it:  Deep fried rice paper wrapped with mix crab meat & cream sauce, served with homemade plum sauce.  When I saw 6 sticks, I thought there was no way I could eat all of them and have room for dinner.  Wrong!  They were so very tasty you could never leave one to be taken away.  The plum sauce was good, and my server brought me the hot spice holder and I used some chili paste to spice up some of the sticks.\u000a\u000aFor the main course, I ordered from the Issan (northern Thailand area) part of the menu which offers foods with more spice kick.  I got the Ped Nom Tok, and the menu describes it like this:  Sliced boneless roasted duck home made with chili paste, herbs, spices & lime juice.  I asked for a spicy level of 4 out of 5.  It was spicy, but from my little array of spices, I added some extra red pepper flakes.  The dish was superb!  The mint that garnished the dish and the raw cabbage gave you something to cool your palate when the red pepper heat got to be a bit much.\u000a\u000aTime for dessert.  I had two things in mind.  Durian sticky rice or coconut ice cream.  I had been warned that the durian would cause horrendous breath.  Anthony Bourdain describes durian this way.  "...Your breath will smell as if you'd been French-kissing your dead grandmother."  Since I was going to a show after dinner, I opted for the coconut ice cream.  It was the safer choice, and it was very good with some small chunks of coconut mixed in.\u000a\u000aI started dinner with a Thai iced coffee and I had an order of sticky rice.\u000a\u000aThe service was fantastic.  There were three ladies who were very attentive and answered a couple of questions I had.  I thought the one was going to say "chicken" when I opted out of the durian sticky rice dessert.  \u000a\u000aThe Yelp deal worked fine.  I paid $10 and received credit for $20 from Weera.  She took the code off my iPhone and asked me to mark the deal used which I did.\u000a\u000aAs I said before, this won't be a one time visit.  It is good, and I am a fan!!  Thanks to my fellow Yelpers for letting me know this place exists.

VAfter hiking at Mount Charleston, four of us stopped here to try their lunch buffet.  One of our group has been here before and recommended it.  It was a good recommendation!\u000a\u000aThe buffet is small but is in the size range of others.  At $11.99, it's price is OK.  Not the cheapest, not the most expensive.  The restaurant is attractive with comfortable seating.  There is a separate section through which you enter where the bar is located.  The buffet is in an adjoining area out of view from the dining room.\u000a\u000aThere was a selection of salad, yogurt, chutney, and desserts at the beginning of the buffet.  After the initial bar, there were several chafing dishes with various foods.  I tried the chicken tikka masala, a curry chicken, dal makhani, onion pakora, and some fried chicken balls--the name of which I can't remember.  Accompanying this was basmati rice.  \u000a\u000aFor the most part, the dishes were good and flavorful.  The dal was bland.  It could have used some seasoning.  The chicken balls were tasty and different.  I should have gotten some chutney for that and the onion pakora but I failed to do so.  Next time.  One of our group noted that the chicken tandoori was dry.  I didn't try this but noted this for future reference.  I made a second trip to the buffet to get something sweet to offset my disposition.  I got one gulab jamun and it was very good.  It was quite soft, and it was not overly sweet.  A very nice ending to lunch.\u000a\u000aService was average.  We were there when the restaurant opened and it soon got busy but there were a couple of people working the small room.  When I went to get my gulab, my dirty plate was not removed.  Other than this, things went OK.\u000a\u000aIf I'm in the area, I'd certainly stop again.  It is in the middle tier of Indian buffets I've tried.  Since it's the closest place to where I live, I'll be back.  I wouldn't recommend coming from the other side of town for the buffet when there are other places just as good or better in the UNLV area.

VI went to the Historic 5th Street School for the second time last night for the Brubeck Brothers Quartet concert.  It's a pleasant auditorium with a raised stage much like countless schools around the country.\u000a\u000aThe 5th Street School is great because it's one of the few buildings we have not torn down.  Instead, this is now where many programs are offered by the Cultural Affairs Office of the City of Las Vegas.  \u000a\u000aThe courtyard with its original fountain is a delight.  Looking across the street from the courtyard, you see the modern Lloyd George Federal Courthouse.  What a difference being on the other side of 5th Street makes!\u000a\u000aI will be taking a tour of the whole facility soon.  If you find a program here that appeals to you, go see it.  Come early and spend some time enjoying the exhibit in the gallery adjoining the auditorium.\u000a\u000aOne tip - the parking lot is quite small.  If you find it full, you can go around the block and park on Clark Street east of Las Vegas Boulevard.  Metered parking spots there that don't require money after 6 PM.

VI was at the Historic 5th Street School last night for a concert with KT Sullivan and Mark Nadler sponsored by the City of Las Vegas Office of Cultural Affairs Office.  It was a wonderful event is the small venue.  The Cultural Affairs Office prices their shows inexpensively - $10 advance purchase, $15 at the door.\u000a\u000aIt was a wonderful 85 minute show of Cole Porter and music from Broadway.  Sullivan and Nadler aren't known outside of NYC as well as they should be.\u000a\u000aBefore shows here, you can check out the art on display in the gallery or look at the wonderful courtyard.  The school is always a good place to visit and the auditorium lends itself well to programs like this!

VI stopped in here today for a late breakfast after a biplane flight.  I was really a neophyte as I wasn't sure what to order.  Finally, I decided to get the Maui Fever crèpe that came with shredded coconut, kiwi, strawberries, and pineapple.  Then I had to decide on ice cream, extra fruit, or yogurt.  I twisted my own arm and went with ice cream and got the cappuccino chuck.\u000a\u000aThe owner explained that the crèpe came without utensils and I thought that was special!  I watched him make the crèpe and then I watched and the woman put the fruit and other things on the crèpe and gently fold the crèpe so it came out like an ice cream cone and I was handed that.\u000a\u000aThe owner came by in a little bit an explained that I should squeeze the top together.  It would be easier to eat and I'd get a mixture of the fruit and it would taste better.  He was right.\u000a\u000aI don't think I'll be coming back.  While the crèpe was good, the shop is on the opposite side of town from where I live.  I also like eating with utensils but this is their place and they go with the tradition.

VI've ridden through the park several times on my bike, and I've walked around it once to gain some knowledge about the mesa above and to the west of the park.\u000a\u000aToday, we parked at the park, walked through it, and then went cross country on our own trail to see Las Vegas from the top of the mesa for which the Mesas is named.\u000a\u000aThe park has good parking, nice green spots for kids and adults, and some very nice walking areas.  Since the Great Recession, the area has not grown as much as before and the park is often less busy than some of the other Summerlin parks.\u000a\u000aIt's a very pleasant place.

VI think this experience is very good.  It's very well thought out, and the technology is quite good.  Since I was alone, I felt a little awkward with some of the actors.  But it was all good fun, and I went along with it.  I do wonder, as one reviewer stated, what it's like if this place is busy.\u000a\u000aThe heart of the show for me was the central information area with the mementos of the different gangsters.  Ben's letter to his wife written on a Western Airlines plane, the letter from Lansky to Menachem Begin and others were really interesting.  \u000a\u000aI loved watching the video of the making of the Godfather movie, but I'd like to view it at home where I'd be a bit more comfortable.  \u000a\u000aThere was some fatigue setting in from all the reading and I was ready to leave.  I'm glad I got the year's pass for Nevada residents when they had the pre-sale in November.  I'll go back and skip the introduction stuff and go right to the artifacts area and read spend more time.\u000a\u000aI agree with the others about the photos.  Why can't Cashman charge a lot less?  I might have purchased one or two, but at $20+ for the photos, that's robbery--but it's going on in the right exhibit place.  Reduce your price, email me the digital photo, and I'll buy!

VI have been to many shows at the Performing Arts Center.  There are two major theatres - the Nicholas J. Horn Theatre  and the BackStage Theatre.  The Horn is a large venue while the BackStage is the black box, smaller performing space.  \u000a\u000aThe college presents a variety of shows from musicals to dance to dramas.  Tomorrow night, I'll be attending my first show of the new season, "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead."\u000a\u000aTicket prices are very reasonable and the performances are quite good.  The staff of the box office is very competent and friendly!

VMe shop at a thrift store.  I think not.  Well, think again.  I did.\u000a\u000aI needed to pick up something nouveau riche for a Yelp Elite event this week at Absinthe with a pre-show party at Central.  I went to Savers to look for some outrageous things to wear.  Flashy, bright jacket, frilly shirt, and a great bow tie.  The problem was--they had none of that.\u000a\u000aInstead, I ended up with a jacket and shirt (I won't describe it any more than that because I don't want to lose the surprise my fellow Eliters will have when they see me.  Rather than nouveau riche, however, it's more like gaudy, bloody awful!!  \u000a\u000aThe store is really well organized as others have mentioned and it was quite clean.  Check out was a bit slow.  It was also an interesting place for people watching.  It was the first time I ever saw a guy who had permanent sideburns--they were tattoed on.  Wow, different doesn't quite describe it!

VOK, I found it--a place to go for French Macarons without having to drive to Bouchon Bakery at the Venetian.  These little gems are just delightful and the place is only a couple of miles from home.\u000a\u000aI got 6 separate flavors, and when I got home, I had the orange and peanut butter ones.  Wonderful!  I have packed the other four delights in a plastic box to take with me on my trip to Utah tomorrow.  I'll have something for a snack in my hotel room at night.\u000a\u000aFrom looking around, I know I have to come back and have lunch.  I need to try one of their sandwiches or get a quiche.  Oh well, there's always a next time.\u000a\u000aBon Appétit!

VI have been back several times since my original review of two years ago.  I've usually been here for macarons, but I've been here twice for a late lunch/early dinner of soup and sandwich.\u000a\u000aThe sandwiches are always very good and the staff is so nice.  Now, just one more thing to try--a quiche.  \u000a\u000aToday I stopped because I finished the last macarons I brought back from Los Angeles Memorial Day weekend and I was missing those gems of pastry.  Manon has added some different flavors and I was pleased to get some of the new ones.  The price of macarons is now $1.10 each, a small increase from when I was there last.\u000a\u000aI also couldn't resist getting a slice of their chocolate truffle cake that my wife and I will be sharing for the a couple of nights.  It is so good.\u000a\u000aPatisserie Manon, you are addictive but that's OK.

VThis is a very fun thing to do.  I thought I'd have problems with the platform because it's 5 stories above the street.  However, not to worry.  When you walk up the stairs to get ready to go to the launch area, you are clipped in with a wire that's attached to a cable.  Besides, looking at the neon signs on Fremont Street East and then the canopy west was a wonderful sight.\u000a\u000aAnyone who wants to know step by step what the procedure is should read P A.'s review.  They have really explained everything well!\u000a\u000aThe ride is short, you don't go very fast, but it is a lot of fun!  I'll be back to do it again!

VI've been going to try Mood for months, but I always just went by.  Last night, that changed.  I went to Mood for an early dinner before a show, and I'm so glad I tried it out.\u000a\u000aI had the Rack of Lamb with mushrooms, fingerling potatoes, and chef's vegetables.  I ordered the lamb rare, and that's the way it was cooked.  The vegetables were red pepper, cherry tomatoes, and sliced carrots.  There was a sauce with the mushrooms that was incredibly good.  They served a coarse textured bread with onion and the butter pats were in this nifty dish covered by a small dome.  \u000a\u000aOf course, one can't leave without dessert, so I had the Chocolate Thunder described on the menu as "...layers of fudge, cake, and chocolate chips."  It was a great finish to this fine meal.\u000a\u000aMy server was Todd.  He was attentive and came by and asked about a refill for my iced tea.  Everything about the dinner was great.  Because preparation took some time, he came and notified me that the dinner would be ready shortly.\u000a\u000aMood is in the Artisan Hotel along the 15, and the atmosphere is worth a trip here.  The room is dark as is the entrance from the valet area.  I took some time after I left Mood to walk around and see some of the art on the walls in the hotel and lounge area.\u000a\u000aThis was a great meal and I'll be back.

VI was in the mood to try a new place for breakfast and I checked Yelp and found this place.  It's a good distance from where I live, but why not drive a little to get a great breakfast, and that's just what happened.\u000a\u000aI like it so much when menus are posted online and I had already chosen the breakfast I was going to get.  When it came time to order, I took my server's recommendation and ordered the rib eye steak chilaquiles.  I chose the pot of bread instead of toast or biscuit.  The bread was good, but I wish it had more cinnamon.  That would have made it and outstanding breakfast accompaniment.\u000a\u000aThe main action was the spice rubbed rib eye steak--there was a small amount of rub flavoring--and it was done rare just the way I ordered it.  For the eggs, I got over easy which was put on top of the refried beans and chips of the chilaquiles.  The cotija cheese added so much flavor!  The eggs were topped with sliced avocado.  Very nice presentation.\u000a\u000aMy server, sorry I didn't note the name, was quite good.  The restaurant is not large and when I was leaving around 9:30, there was a wait for tables.  I think I'll go back sometime and get my original choice and compare the two!  I am glad I gave Rise & Shine a try!

VI had to stop at the Bonneville Transit Center today to pick up an ID card.  Wow!  What a nice facility.  I was never in the old DTC and I can only guess that it couldn't compare with the BTC.\u000a\u000aI have yet to ride an RTC bus.  I'm not sure if I'll ever be back here, but it is nice for those people that depend on the bus for getting about Las Vegas.

VI went to see this show tonight.  It is a small venue which is both good and bad.  It's good because you're mere feet away from the tigers used in some of the illusions.  It's bad because you can see some of the movement of the table as one of his helpers "reappears" in a box which had been pushed through with swords.  Also, Arthur's grand entrance loses some of its luster because it was obviously built for a larger venue.  When he steps out of the glass pyramid, he is so high up, you can't see the top half of his head because he's above the stage top.  It's not until he jumps down to the stage that you see the complete magician.\u000a\u000aAs the previous reviewer said, some of the act is hokey.  He does the standard metamorphosis in different ways, and he has a straight jacket, locked box escape.\u000a\u000aThis is a show that's good for kids.  It's just under and hour and it keeps you entertained throughout.

VMy initial reaction was positive when I walked in and saw the nice produce.  After that, everything went downhill.  I needed to get some flavored coffee.  The area was littered with spilled coffee beans from people and the shelf below the holding tubes had four or five bags with different amounts of beans that were just left there.\u000a\u000aWhen I went to add beans to the hopper of the grinder, it was 3/4 full with beans someone had just dumped in there and left.  The top of the grinder where the beans go was filthy with grounds from previously ground beans and loose beans.  The whole area was disgusting.\u000a\u000aI didn't buy any coffee here.  Instead, I went to the checkout and left.  When I got home, I looked for one item I knew I had picked up.  It was then I realized she hadn't bagged it and it was still at the store--I guess.  That's my mistake for not checking.\u000a\u000aI won't be stopping at this location again.  It's awful!

VFor an intimate showroom, the Wolf Theatre cannot be beaten.  There are about 7 rows of ten seats.  The seats are comfortable, large seats with good sized arm rests.  As Pete G. pointed out, this was built by Debbie Reynolds when she owned this hotel/casino and it was a screening room for films for her and her guests.\u000a\u000aLast night, I went to see the Legends of Comedy Show with Sammy Shore and Pete Barbutti.  The show was good.  The theatre would add something to any show it's that nice.\u000a\u000aThe place is really well done with carpeting on the walls and the small nature makes it a very pleasant venue.

VI've stopped at this outlet a few times and I enjoy it quite a bit.  There's a good amount of table space and the wifi is available as it is at all Starbucks.\u000a\u000aThe only drawback to this location is its location.  It's a pain to get in and out sometimes because you have to cross traffic on Rainbow Boulevard.  You also have to know to come out a different driveway if you're going north on Rainbow.  Once you know, though, it's OK.

The bruschetta was seasoned nicely, and I thought the dish was OK.\u000a\u000aMy wife had a grilled chicken breast with a basil and garlic sauce.  There was no basil seasoning in the sauce at all and only a small amount of garlic.

VI've been going to try this place for a long time and finally did so last night.  I had issues with each of the courses, but I am still giving it and A-OK rating as these are students and not professionals yet.\u000a\u000aIn two sections--food and service--I'll review Technique and for the food I'm using description directly from the menu.\u000a\u000aThe Food:\u000a\u000aA basket of three rolls was brought--one multi-grain, one rye, and one regular roll.  The herbed butter served with them was very good!\u000a\u000aCourse 1:  I chose the Beef carpaccio with charred beef sirloin. Shaved Parmesan. Truffle oil. Balsamic reduction. Black pepper. Field greens.\u000a\u000aThe salad was very good.  The balsamic reduction dressing was very tasty and the field greens were fresh.  The problem here was with the prep.  The beef was placed on the salad plates some time before the salad was created.  It had then been refrigerated--nearly to freezing it seemed.  As a result, the thin beef slices stuck to the plate.  I can understand the need to avoid exposing the carpaccio to room temperatures, but this was really a cold plate.  The server asked me if I wanted freshly ground pepper and she used the peppermill.  Nice touch.\u000a\u000aCourse 2:  Pork tenderloin saltimbocca.  prosciutto, sage butter, asparagus, risotto, Marsala semi glacé.  The pork was cooked way too long making its name incorrect.  Instead of being tender, it was difficult to cut and much of the flavor was wrung from the pork.  The prosciutto on top was very good and the risotto was not bad considering it was made in advance and piped from a pastry bag and kept warm in some hit water.  There were two asparagus pieces, a little meager even given the reasonable price of the meal. The server asked about freshly ground pepper for the main course, too, which was welcome.\u000a\u000aCourse 3:  Chocolate lava cake. Peanut butter ganache and vanilla bean ice cream.  The problem with dessert was that the chocolate cake was very dry.  Either it was older or it was baked too much.  The peanut butter ganache was nice and the vanilla bean ice cream was good.\u000a\u000aThe service:\u000a\u000aThe woman who served my table greeted me when she came with the menu but did not identify herself by name and she did not tell me the soup of the day nor the catch of the day.  It was when I heard a different server at the table behind me introduce himself by name and then list the unpublished things on the menu that I knew they existed.\u000a\u000aMy server was attentive, came back during each course to see if everything was OK.  She refilled my iced tea without asking, but I had to request the sweetener a couple of minutes after she brought my glass of iced tea.\u000a\u000aI'm not sure if it was the server or the school, but I would recommend not bringing the bill while I'm eating dessert.  Can't it wait?  Also, it really is best to clear the table of dirty dishes before bringing the bill back.  You do need to have some room to put the holder down and sign the charge without moving plates aside.  The removal of used sweetener packets was a fail.  \u000a\u000aIn spite of the things I found wrong with the dinner, I will be going back.  It was interesting watching the students prepare the dishes through the glass of the kitchen.  The food was passable, and hopefully the students and staff from Le Cordon Bleu read reviews and improve from the reviews.  I was told the menu changes every 3 to 4 months.  I'll give it some time and then I'll stop in again!\u000a\u000aEdit:  The price is now $18.95 for a 3 course meal and that includes non-alcohol beverage.

VThis is my Sunday bank.  I go for a bike ride and get to the 2/3 spot at this plaza along Charleston Boulevard and Desert Foothills Drive.  When I need to make a quick deposit or withdrawal, this is the branch to which I go.  It was opened during the building boom, but many of the houses didn't follow, so this is often a slow place.\u000a\u000aIt's easy to get to, there are several other businesses here that makes the whole area a one stop place.\u000a\u000aI have found the tellers to be quite competent when I've had to go inside.  But, since this is my Sunday bank, I usually just ride my bike up to the ATM outside, make my withdrawal, and make a fast pedal away with my loot.  Actually, I normally go right next door to the Starbucks in Albertson's.  Like I said,ma one stop place!

VI'd rate this a 3 normally, but the young lady who waited on me was so pleasant that I'm giving them the extra star for exemplary service.\u000a\u000aI do wish they had regular salt bagels, but I'll make do with the pretzels bagels (with the salt) that are quite tasty!\u000a\u000aThe parking can get a bit tight in that plaza at times, so it's not the most convenient location.  On the other hand, I jump right on the 215 and I'm hone in 6 minutes.  Not bad!

V***** Review is for summer 2013 Restaurant Week menu *****\u000a\u000aI was so glad to look at the Restaurant Week list and see Comme Ça listed.  I've wanted to try this place for a long time now and this made a perfect time to do it.\u000a\u000aI went with the 5 course RW menu with the supplemental pan roast of foie gras for an extra charge of $19.\u000a\u000aBread was brought out quickly after we ordered and the thick bread sticks were very hot!!!\u000a\u000aCourse 1 - I chose the warm asparagus salad.  The salad was a surprise.  On the bottom was the warm asparagus spears.  They were topped with mixed greens and the black truffle salumi was sprinkled on top.  To the side was a poached egg with Hollandaise.  It was an interesting and flavorful way to make a salad.\u000a\u000aCourse 2 - I got the roasted bone marrow with oxtail jam.  What delicious food and what a lot to eat!  The roasted bone had some coarsely ground salt on the side and the oxtail jam was a large serving of meat with some greens on top and slices of small toasted bread around the edge of the ramekin that held the jam. \u000a\u000aCourse - 3 The supplemental roast of foie gras with vanilla bread pudding, foie gras and a goie gras "cherry bomb" was next.  The roasted foie gras was on the vanilla bread pudding and the "cherry bomb" was another piece of foie gras with a glacé colored red and a cherry pit coming from the "cherry bomb."  Very tasty and a nice play on the firework.\u000a\u000aCourse 4 - Parisian gnocchi with braised lamb neck and goat cheese with some fava beans.  It was good.\u000a\u000aCourse 5 - Peach pie with almond streusel and rum raisin ice cream.\u000a\u000aThe whole meal was very nice and quite interesting the way the chef planned the food and its presentation. One of the things that stood out were the rich sauces with the food.  There was a lot of effort into getting those tasty sauces with the courses. The items on the RW menu are available from the everyday summer menu but I doubt I would have ordered them as separates if they hadn't been packaged like this for Restaurant Week.\u000a\u000aOur server, Sabrina, was a very pleasant woman.  She looked after our table.  It wasn't too hard as last night was a very sparse night even when we left around 7 PM.  It seemed like all the restaurants at that section of the Cosmopolitan were low on customers.\u000a\u000aThe kitchen seemed slow.  It took almost 2 hours for this meal, something I'd expect from a multi-course meal at a restaurant when I'm doing a tasting menu of this or more courses.  The wait sometimes was welcomed but then grew too long at other times.\u000a\u000aThe views out the windows toward Planet Hollywood and Paris were great!  What more could you want except to be sitting at an outside table.  A nice way to finish Restaurant Week with a meal here and then "A Streetcar Named Desire" at a community theatre a few miles from there.\u000a\u000aAddendum:  My wife, who's very food challenged and resists trying anything new, ordered the Comme Ça burger, a large burger with cheddar cheese and slaw and a HUGE order of French fries.  She liked it very much and even took a small taste of my bone marrow!  Score one for change!  Sabrina asked when we wanted her burger brought so she wasn't sitting there already long done waiting for me to finish.  She got her burger at my foie gras course and it worked perfectly!

VI came to this Lowe's to buy some water softener salt.  OK, that's not very sexy, but it's necessary to replenish the tank in my garage periodically.\u000a\u000aPrices are OK.  I really don't price check this item so I get it whenever I'm at a convenient place, and this was convenient.\u000a\u000aIt seems like there's only a few people in this store whenever I've been here.  That makes parking and check out easy.\u000a\u000aThe staff was quick to check me out and offer assistance (respectfully declined) getting the 8 bags into my car.\u000a\u000aI'm sure I'll be returning.

VThis truly is as good as it gets.  Excellent choreography, very talented dancers, superb Frank Sinatra vocals, a 17 piece live band,  and great lighting.  \u000a\u000aThe dancers do some moves that are amazing and some of the dances are cute and funny.  My favorite dances were to "That's Life" and "You Make Me Feel So Young."  \u000a\u000aI don't think the smile left my face during the entire 70 minute show.  Since it has been extended to the beginning of April, I'll be buying a ticket to see the show again before it leaves for good.  \u000a\u000aIf you like dance, this is a must see!

VI had a free ticket for this show.  I had heard of the group before but I really didn't know what their music was like.  My seat was in the next to last row which was fine.  The Fator Theatre has three large screens, one on each side of the stage and a large one behind the performers.  I came to hear the music, not see the guys per se.\u000a\u000aThe show is roughly divided into 4 parts.  The first part has the group singing some of their hits--none of which I recognized--but I enjoyed them all.  They have a good sound and the guys are very talented.  The band was excellent.  The second part of the show was a salute to Motown.  OK, now you're singing songs I know because they're going back in time.  After the Motown salute, there's a period of a cappella music--the music that got them their start.  They're joined by a 4th singer for this section.  Finally, they go back to singing some of their own songs.  \u000a\u000aMuch of the audience got right into the show from the get go.  For the most part, they were several years younger than me.  They could sing along for they knew all the lyrics.  Wow, and can women shriek with ear splitting loudness!  \u000a\u000aI'm glad I went to see Boyz II Men.  It was an enjoyable show for me and also a learning one.  However, more Motown, please!

VWicked Spoon is 5 stars all the way.   It is certainly in my top tier of Las Vegas buffets.  This was my first time here, and I was very pleased.\u000a\u000aFirst, my server was very friendly and very competent.  She poured my bottled water as soon as I was seated and asked about alcohol or other drinks.  She was prompt and attentive.  I wish I knew her name.  She is an asset to the Wicked Spoon.\u000a\u000aI liked the tapas style items.  A small bowl with two peeled shrimp, some cocktail sauce, and a little lemon slice.  What more could you want?  My food looked like it was plated by a Top Chef contestant because of this serving idea.  There are plenty of all you can eat foods, too, so for those of you who don't care for the idea of small plates, gorge.\u000a\u000aDesserts were excellent!  The chocolate covered strawberry was delicious and I had some very interesting fudge and a chocolate covered crab apple.  Different and good!!\u000a\u000aThe variety was excellent.  I just wish I could have tried more things.  But I guess that's what will keep me coming back for more.  And that great server.  I'll look for her and see if I can request her section!

VWe went here for a special occasion tonight and had a wonderful dinner.  If you had told me before we left that my wife would eat foie gras or veal cheeks, I would have laughed in your face.  Now I can't say that.  She did eat that and she liked it!\u000a\u000aLet's start at the beginning.  We had an early reservation at 5 PM and as soon as they opened, the hostess came and got us as we people watched at the Cosmo.  We were seated in the area a few steps up from the main floor.  Our server was Donny and he was top notch!\u000a\u000aHe talked us through some possibilities after we studied the menu for awhile.  First, we ordered white asparagus with Idiazabal cheese.  The cheese was shredded so finely and had such a good flavor that it was a beautiful topping for the asparagus.  \u000a\u000aNext we each had soup--me gazpacho and my wife the Black garlic soup.  Both were very good!  \u000a\u000aThis was followed by Ground pork and foie gras cannelloni and boneless chicken wings.  By now, my wife was getting into the tapas idea and the sharing part and we each enjoyed the dishes.  The Béchamel sauce on the cannelloni was a superb addition to the delicate cannelloni that were filled with very good ground pork and foie gras--and yes, she ate the foie gras and liked it!\u000a\u000aOne last main dish to share was the veal cheeks with morels.  It was excellent and the veal was fork tender.\u000a\u000aOn to dessert--I ordered the Chocolate hazelnut cake with praline ice cream and my wife ordered the rice pudding with vanilla and cinnamon with a lemon sorbet.  The cake was rich, dark chocolate and decadent--just the way I like my chocolate!  The rice pudding was very good.  My wife thought the sorbet was too sour but I disagreed thinking it was a great counterpoint to the mild sweetness of the pudding.\u000a\u000aService was excellent throughout the dinner.  Bus people did their jobs efficiently, more iced tea was brought, Donny came around to suggest we might want to order our hot foods so the flow of the meal would not be interrupted and he had recommendations for us when we asked and he was spot on with them!\u000a\u000aI'll be returning.  Next I want to try the lobster paella along with other dishes.

VThis was one of the best dining experiences I've had.  I've been going to try Twist for awhile and I went there last night for a special meal.  I got the 6 course chef's tasting menu.  I made a reservation for 6 PM, the time they open. I was going to Blue Man Group later and I wanted to have plenty of time for a relaxed dinner and time to get to the show.\u000a\u000aDavid took my order after answering some questions I had about the menu--a menu I had poured over online.  He was a great help.\u000a\u000aThere were five canapés delivered shortly after.  They're small and they were quite interesting in flavor and execution.  They were in/on three items.  My favorite was the salad of watermelon and dragon fruit, passion fruit, and basil.  A close second was the paprika-tomato meringue with smoked salmon and black olive agar.  The almond and ginger sable was none too shabby either.  All 5 were excellent!\u000a\u000aThe first course was glazed Skate with red miso water, spring vegetables and Paris mushroom duxelle.\u000a\u000aThe second course consisted of the 3 small bites--a grilled prawn on spinach velouté with garlic and parmesan.  The second bite was a piece of lobster with poached turnip, toasted sesame, and bisque.  The third portion was a cold, soft-boiled egg with Ossetra caviar in the yolk on a bed of marinated clams, red ahi tuna, and cuttlefish.\u000a\u000aCourse three was Mediterranean John Dory with pink pepper, fine foie gras tart and baby artichokes.\u000a\u000aThe fourth course was a palate cleanser.  It was a champagne sorbet which had some salted cucumber and a Campari soaked Red Beet.  I was blown away by the cucumber and sorbet combination.  Fantastic!\u000a\u000aCourse five was Sonoma Valley Duck Breast with Alexia Potato, berries on a piquillo pepper reduction, and Bigarrde sauce.  The duck was excellent and the tart fruit with the pepper reduction--another superb flavor pairing!\u000a\u000aThe last course was dessert which consisted of 5 different small desserts.  They were a coffee panna cotta with Bailey's, Kahlua, Coffee Gelée and lime sorbet.  Almond-Frangipane cake with lemon-Krisch syrup.  A third was strawberry soup with raspberry and basil, and a "Bella Vista" granité.  Then a fresh coconut tartlet with iced coconut, cilantro, and celery curls.  The last was a chocolate ganache.  As with the entire meal, the flavors developed in the desserts was wonderful!  Coconut, cilantro and celery--who would have thought?\u000a\u000aService was excellent all evening, even when things became quite busy.  When my iced tea got low, a server brought me a new glass and switched the two.  I didn't have to ask, it was just done.  A funny example, when things weren't so busy, I sneezed.  Within a few moments, a server was at the table with a box of Kleenex.  Service with a smile and funny!  The same server also brought me a small Mandarin Oriental bag with a copy of all the menu items.  He had heard me mention to one of the servers that I'd never remember all the things.  The server wanted to make sure I had something to remind me.  Classy!\u000a\u000aThe restaurant is very classy and the view is excellent.  I was there during daylight and dined long enough to enjoy seeing the lights come on along the Boulevard!  I wore a jacket and tie--their website requests that men wear jackets.  Most came dressed with business casual.\u000a\u000aTruly a wonderful dinner, about 2 1/2 hours.  It's worth the cost for the chance to try some unique foods in a unique setting with superb service!

VReview is for Restaurant Week Fall 2012 menu:\u000a\u000aThis was a four course meal with no choice for each of the courses.   \u000a\u000aCourse 1:  Carpaccio Of Mediterranean Caught Fish With Fresh Herbs, Citrus, Afrala Sea Salt And Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  The fish was so delicate and so tasty.  The olive oil and the salt made the dish.  It was very good.\u000a\u000aCourse 2:  Grilled octopus with roasted peppers and assorted grilled mushrooms.  Another winner of a dish.  The octopus was so tasty and the mushrooms were very good. \u000a\u000aCourse 3:  Grilled Mediterranean sea bass.  It was the whole fish with the head cut off and placed to the left of the opened fish.  The server cautioned me about avoiding the collar bones which were attached to the meat.  A very tasty fish, perfectly cooked to preserve its moistness.\u000a\u000aCourse 4:  Greek walnut cake with Kaimaki ice cream.  Very tasty cake and flavorful ice cream.  \u000a\u000aThe meal came with a basked of bread--2 slices in my case--I was dining alone.  There was a small dish into which the server poured olive oil for dipping the bread.\u000a\u000aI really like the room.  The decor is very nice that I'd like to call modern rustic.  The lights have small filaments in a twist formation that give off a pleasant glow.  The furniture is modern.\u000a\u000aService was quite good given that there was a party of about 20 people that came about 10 minutes after me and they took a lot of time.\u000a\u000aA few things keep this from getting 5 stars.  Between the second and third course, the waiter removed my bread and olive oil.  As he was doing it he said, "You're done with the bread, right?"  I was so surprised by his question and his taking that I just shook my head in agreement.  Maybe he thought I had eaten the main course and would soon have dessert.  Maybe I should have jammed a fork into his hand if I had one.  He'd already taken that.  \u000a\u000aThere were several small bones in the main part of the fish.  I could just imagine being a judge on Chopped and having my say about that.  Very surprising.\u000a\u000aLast, I wish they'd shut the door to the outside.  It was Saturday night and not too far from the entrance are some table games at the Cosmopolitan.  There's also a lot of foot traffic out there of 20 somethings who'd spent part of the day at the pool--not just swimming and ogling the ladies--but also indulging in the spirits of their choice.  They were loud and it carried into the restaurant.  Close the door.\u000a\u000aI am a fan of Milos.  I will return, and I think I'll do so for their lunch special.   it should be quieter, too!

VI stopped in here tonight for some buzz to keep me awake after a grueling hike today.  The staff was friendly and I was on my way quickly.  Yet another location crossed off my list of Starbucks left to visit.

VThis Starbucks was just what I needed last night when I went to the Silverton.  I had my quad espresso and was out of the place very quickly.  The service was great!\u000a\u000aI like that they take the Gold Card from Starbucks.  Some casino locations are still way behind the times when it comes to using the card.\u000a\u000aThe seating area is large.  This is a little oasis at the Silverton.

V***3.5 stars***\u000a\u000aOur hiking group went here today for our annual Chinese New Year lunch.  One of our hiking group is Chinese and she ordered the same thing for us all.  We had a choice of the soup we wanted--I chose hot and sour soup--and everyone got an order of Xiao Long Bao, the soup dumplings about which many of the reviews mention.\u000a\u000aThe soup and dumplings were both very good.  I've had Xiao Long Bao before at another restaurant and these were on par or even a bit better.  The hot and sour soup was tasty.  \u000a\u000aFinding the place was a bit hard.  There was no sign that I saw--certainly none from the parking lot.  I knew it was on the second floor of this shopping plaza in Chinatown, but I didn't know to head down the little area that runs south from the elevator.\u000a\u000aThere were 10 of us at the round table.  Service was adequate--nothing special.  They delivered the dishes we ordered but did not bring refills of water and we had to ask for more tea.  One pot for a table of 10?\u000a\u000aIn all, it was a nice lunch to celebrate the Year of the Dragon.

VThe Forum Shops at Caesars Palace is always a fun place to go.  I'm usually going to one of two places - the Apple Store or Max Brenner's.  I enjoy wandering the different areas and people watching.\u000a\u000aThere is a selection of great stores if this is your type of shopping pleasure.  The stores are for the most part high end, high mark up stores.  \u000a\u000aI also like going to the newer section and riding the circular escalators.  It was quite nice to see these after the new section opened.\u000a\u000aThe shows in two areas, Atlantis and the other one, are getting a bit old.  The animatronic people are technology from years ago.  These need to be updated.\u000a\u000aAll in all, I like just coming here and enjoying the vibe.  It's a great place!

VThis was one of the best food evenings I have ever spent.  I made my reservation through their process about a month ago.  While I originally requested the 5:30 seating, there was a singleton space for the 8:30 so I went for it.\u000a\u000aI showed up about 8:05 and handed my gold ticket to them.  I was then escorted to the bar where I had some ice water and started to meet my dining mates for the evening - Greg and Lindsey from Glasgow, Scotland.\u000a\u000aAt about 8:40, we were escorted into the separate dining area that has a horseshoe shaped table with 8 seats.  Behind the table was the staff ready to greet us, tell us a few rules, and encourage us to ask questions about anything.  Then the dinner started.\u000a\u000aOver the next three hours, the staff made some of the most creative, tasty, and beautifully plated dishes I have experienced.  Since the room seats 8 people only, generally four servers each took 2 plates so all 8 of us were served in unison.  I had the non-alcohol drink paring which gave me a chance to have spirit-like drinks along with the other diners.  And in two instances, my food or drink was not laced with alcohol but with lemonade or some other substitute.\u000a\u000aEach of the 20+ courses was explained.  We often had questions about technique, ingredients, or other matters.  One of the chefs came out of the kitchen to explain the red mushroom we enjoyed and explained why it was red and whence it came.\u000a\u000aThe staff is amazing.  They are friendly, always smiling, and always enjoying what they do.  I really felt that I was a valued visitor.\u000a\u000aThe room - oh it's quite different.  Two walls are lined with card catalog boxes to represent the knowledge Andrés has built up in his mind over the years.  There's a bustier which know one explained on the wall and a ladder with high heels on the rungs.  Very creative and innovative!\u000a\u000aMidnight was almost upon us as we finished the dessert courses.  We then signed the guest book - I was diner #1693.  I then passed the book to Lindsey to sign and so we went around the table.\u000a\u000aI recommend this to anyone who wants to try something very different and wants to find out about molecular gastronomy.  It was truly a very delicious and memorable evening.  All the staff at é made it outstanding with food and service!

VOnce was definitely not enough for é by José Andrés.  I dined here in September of 2011 and I felt the need to go back and try some of the newer things being described by newer reviews.\u000a\u000aLast night's experience was just as good or better than my first time.  There were some dishes that were the same, but many were different.  Sitting in the private room with your fellow diners, watching the chefs put together the courses and watching their meticulous plating work is an incredible experience.  We had only 4 diners last night because the others couldn't keep their reservation due to airline delay.\u000a\u000aOne of the dishes that I especially like is the dehydrated meringue filled with bleu cheese and topped with praline cream.  This was served both times I was here and it is superb!  One thing new last night was the foie gras baked in salt.  Exceptional when it was served with the citrus juice.\u000a\u000aAnother dish of note was the crispy chicken skin with two chicken oysters.  Wow, such thin, crisp chicken skin and the wonderful oysters on the skin.  It was a delicate pick up to eat.\u000a\u000aOne final dish of note, although they almost all are, was the ham and bean soup.  The ham flavor is in the broth and the beans are three large beans created from three kinds of deconstructed beans and reformed into these luscious, soft gems.  Wow!\u000a\u000aFor anyone who wants to have an exceptional meal, make your reservations via email and do go.  It is pricey, but remember, it is both a show and a great meal all in one.  I'll wager some lose more in a couple hands of blackjack than they'll spend here.\u000a\u000aI am pleased to be guest #1693 and #6212.  In another year or so when they rotate some new dishes in, I'll go back and get my third gold ticket--one of the few things I save.

VI am generally on one section of this trail or another every Sunday.  It has been a treat to ride off road on a designated trail for bikers and walkers.  From where I live, it's all downhill going from Sahara/Charleston area to Trop.  On the way back, it's uphill, but it's an easy grade so there's no huge amount of exertion.\u000a\u000aThere are two street crossings that you need to do with care--Flamingo and Fort Apache.  Other than that, there are underpasses at Hualapai and Desert Inn and a new overpass (built and opened this year) over Town Center Drive.  The crossing at Sahara and the 215 is generally a quieter spot but take care nonetheless.\u000a\u000aI am pleased to see the increasing numbers of people who use the trail for jogging, walking, and biking.  Now, if they would only continue it north beyond Charleston as there are plans to do, it would be great.  Funding from SNPLMA (Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act) has almost all dried up, so future expansion will take time.  \u000a\u000aIt is nice to see the County in general is building trails that will connect so we could conceivably ride to the east side of town from Summerlin with a minimum amount of on street riding.

VI stopped in yesterday when I was in this plaza as I had read good things about the bakery on Yelp.   I was disappointed in the rolls I bought.  They were multi-grain topped rye rolls and they were dry.  I haven't yet tried the pretzel rolls.  I hope they're better than the rye ones.\u000a\u000aI also bought two cookies, a peanut butter and a chocolate chip.  The peanut butter cookie was good.  The chocolate chip is in the freezer for another day.\u000a\u000aSince this isn't my neighborhood, I'll stop elsewhere for baked goods.  I really think the rolls in grocery stores are as good as what I bought yesterday.  The bakery was OK.

VI have been to the Plaza many times but this year was the first time I went for the New Year festivities on Sunday.  It was $3 to get into the vendors and the entertainment.  It was fun, but I didn't stay around the entertainment too long because it was a warm day and it meant a lot of standing in place which is never fun.\u000a\u000aI did a walk around the vendors, got a free shirt and grocery bag from caesars Entertainment, won a paper umbrella by rolling some dice, found the Yelp table and bowed several time, and I looked at the assorted food vendors.  While it was a fun time, it's not something that would be on my radar as a yearly event.\u000a\u000aI had a better time, as I have in the past, of just walking around the mall and looking at the menus of the various Asian restaurants and checking their ratings on Yelp do decide on future places to try when I'm in the area.  Since I often go to Las Vegas Little Theatre which is in Chinatown, I can do two things in the evening and enjoy some good food before dinner.\u000aI did make a purchase.  I stopped in the Diamond Bakery, a place I've been to several times before.  \u000a\u000aI do like the Las Vegas Chinatown Plaza.  Although small with many good places spread out to the west along Spring Mountain Road, this is still a fun place to walk around and soak up the sights.

VSlidin' Thru HQ is quite nice.  There's some tables and two booths.  You can eat outside under the covered patio.  The best thing about the place is that you're not waiting in the sun at their truck with people in front of you ordering 15 sliders for their offices.  That really irritated the hell out of me when I wait near Cox Communications.  45 minutes in lines some jerks were taking texts and upping their count as the line progressed, sloooowwwwlllllyyyy!\u000a\u000aI had a Barby and a Pep Pep.  Both were excellent.  Since I already had a taco from the Lime Food truck in the parking lot, I didn't have the room for some fries.  Next time.\u000a\u000aTheir sliders are quite good.  I think I'll stop in again when I'm in the area.  It's too far to go for sliders, but if I'm around, I'll definitely stop in.\u000a\u000aNice HQ, guys!

VWe had a Groupon expiring in a few weeks and decided to use it last night on a lazy Labor Day evening.  I had looked at the menu online and we pretty much knew what we were going to order.\u000a\u000aFor starters, we shared the appetizer polpette, baked turkey meatballs in tomato sauce and parmesan cheese.  The meatballs were excellent.  They were juicy and the tomato sauce billed on the menu as San Marzano tomato, was also very good.  It made a nice dish for sharing.\u000a\u000aThis was the first time in years that we have gotten pizza.  I know that's almost un-American but it's true.  We ordered the quattro fromaggio with bufala mozzarella, ricotta, parmesan, and fontina cheeses.  The pizza made 4 large slices and was almost the perfect size for two people.  I had to bite the bullet and finish more than two slices but we all have to make sacrifices.  We ordered it Neapolitan style.  It was a treat!\u000a\u000aA little dessert never hurts the ending of a meal and we ordered the sweet bufala mozzarella with honey and pistachio nuts.  A small size but just right for two people.  A nice ending to a good meal.\u000a\u000aService was excellent.  Matthew had a good sense of humor and was a top notch server.  I mentioned to one of the owners (?) that the Groupon worked the way they hoped.  It got us in the door and the food will bring us back.  This was a nice change.

VThese guys do a very good tribute show to the Bee Gees.  Their voices are similar to the Bee Gees I grew up with and to which I listened a lot.  From the late 60s with "Massachusetts" to the more modern disco sounds of Grease and Saturday Night Fever, they covered a litany of the Bee Gees music.\u000a\u000a1/3 of the way into the show, the drummer and bass player left the stage and the 3 used just one mike and one guitar for several songs they sang.  It was a superb series of songs and really showed off their talents.\u000a\u000aAt the end, when they were doing the disco music, Club "Mo" opened and people were invited to come up and dance and one number they sang was "You Should Be Dancing."  \u000a\u000aAs for the venue, it's relatively small, holding a couple of hundred people.  I got a seat along the counter between the floor seating and the rear seats.  It was a great place to sit because I had a place to lean on, place my soda, and just be comfortable a bit higher up than the floor and with an unobstructed view of the stage.  I've been in the theatre before to see Louie Anderson and Ronn Lucas, and I was seated at one of the 8 person long tables, and I don't like that layout as well.\u000a\u000aA few gripes about shows in general, namely audiences.  Please plan to arrive ON TIME.  Coming in 20 minutes late is not fashionable and is very disruptive to other members of the audience.  Also, the fact that you paid to see the show doesn't mean you have the right to keep talking throughout the show.  Why do people pay good money to see a show and then miss a lot of it because their talking with the person with whom they came.  Shut up, watch, and listen.\u000a\u000aThis is a great show!  Go and see it.

VAs I was leaving a movie at the Suncoast, I decided to stop here and buy some bagels.  I've tried several places around town and one more try couldn't hurt and besides, it was where I was.\u000a\u000aI got 6 assorted flavors.  While not being the texture of bagels from New York (Upstate and Down), they are as good as others I've bought around the area.  \u000a\u000aThis wouldn't be my go to bagel place, but when in need and due to its convenience, I'm sure I'll be stopping here in the future for more.

VNear the end of a long bicycle ride, I stopped here for breakfast.  I was immediately drawn to their seasonal menu because I saw pumpkin--multi grain pumpkin nut pancakes.  After looking at the choices, I asked by server, Trina, if I could get just the pancakes.  I really didn't want eggs and ham or bacon in addition to the pancakes.  "Of course," was her answer and she placed my order immediately.\u000a\u000aI sat at the small counter at the rear of the restaurant in what is almost a private dining room.  Trina brought me coffee quickly and she refilled my cup often.  \u000a\u000aThe pumpkin nut pancakes were great and the pumpkin chiffon served on top in lieu of syrup should be renamed pumpkin crack.  It is delicious.\u000a\u000aMy breakfast here was tasty, service was excellent, and I'd stop in again if I were in the neighborhood more often.

VI went to the Artifice last night for a drink before a play at the Art Square Theatre.  The Artifice is part of the whole Art Square building at the Corner of First and Hoover.  The Artifice has a performing section in two different sections and last night they were having an art class in the section closest to the theatre.\u000aThe Artifice is part of the whole Art Square building at the Corner of First and Hoover.\u000a\u000aI went to the bar and got a diet Coke.  The bartender asked if I was going to the theatre.  When I told him I was, he put the drink in a plastic cup which is allowed in the theatre.\u000a\u000aIt was fairly quiet last night.  The bar area is a large, dimly lit place with lots of seats at the bar and at booths in the bar area.  It appears like it'd be a good spot to spend some time with your friends and have a few drinks before going somewhere in the Arts District downtown.

VAnother CES show, another new place to try for breakfast.  I decided to try the Sugar Factory for breakfast and I'm glad I did.\u000a\u000aI had looked over the menu online before going, but I still looked again and was torn among three or so items.  I ordered the chocolate French toast which the menu described as dark chocolate stuffed brioche, strawberries, and chocolate syrup.  My server, Mariela, asked if I wanted maple syrup or chocolate syrup.  Hell, in for a penny in for a pound--I'll take the chocolate syrup.  She then asked, dark, light, or white chocolate.  I went with the dark.\u000a\u000aThe breakfast was not long in coming but it was long enough that I could enjoy watching the tourists think sitting on the patio was OK for this cold morning.  I also watched as the fountains at the Bellagio just shot upwards steadily for about 2 minutes.  The crew were out there doing maintenance.\u000a\u000aThe French toast was delightful.  It was a small portion, but for something this rich, that's exactly what you want!  I found myself breaking a small piece of brioche off and dipping the bread into the chocolate sauce.  Dessert for breakfast!  That's the way to go!\u000a\u000aService was OK but it could have been better.  It wasn't until I was done with my French toast that I was asked about more coffee.  Considering how few people there were this morning, Mariela should have checked back with me long before this to see how things were and offer more coffee sooner.  Still, I rate the breakfast 4 stars because it was great tasting, the people watching was good, and it was a good choice to go here.\u000a\u000aEdit:  I asked when the check was brought if they give Total Rewards credit for the cost of the bill.  They don't, but if you give them your card, they'll give you a 20% discount off your entrée.

VKyara has been on my to try list for awhile and tonight was the night I got the chance to go.  Having read many of the reviews from friends, I had some good tips to follow when dining here.\u000a\u000aI sat at the sushi bar a place I like because it's always fun to watch the chefs working their magic and you see a kitchen at work.\u000a\u000aI started by ordering three items, Gobo chips (fried burdock root), Iko Geso Age (deep fried squid tentacles), and Enoki with bacon (thin Japanese mushrooms wrapped in bacon and grilled on a skewer.)  \u000a\u000aThe Gobo chips reminded me of very thin French fries with a bit different texture and a different flavor.  It's the root of the burdock so it has some of the flavor from where it grew.  The seasoning on the Gobo was excellent.\u000a\u000aIko Geso Age, deep fried squid tentacles, were uniformly cooked and seasoned with some salt.  The squid was very flavorful and almost every bite was tender.\u000a\u000aNext was the enoki with bacon.  I think most people have seen enoki, either on TV or in the produce section of a market.  Enoki is a very thin stemmed mushroom, white in color, and in this preparation, a number of the mushrooms are gathered together something like a sheaf of wheat and carefully held together by being wrapped by the bacon and placed on a skewer.  It's then grilled.  It is a very tasty dish!\u000a\u000aThis is what I like about tapas style restaurants, I've eaten three dishes, well actually four, and I still have room to try one more thing.  I asked about their mountain potato on a hot plate.  One of the chefs explained to me that it might not be pleasant to my palate that it was slimy and it had a taste that you either loved or hated at first bite.  He also said the dish was too much for one person in size.  OK, next time I go, I have to go with a group of Yelp friends.  Instead, I ordered a butabara (pork belly)  skewer with salt.  They'll do it unsalted, salted, or with salt on the side.  What tasty pork!  This is reason to return although there' still so much to explore on the menu.\u000a\u000aI mention and extra dish but didn't explain it.  When you check in on Yelp, it brings up a screen that gives you a free appetizer.  It was small and had some fish and other items.  It was a good starter and a nice perk for a check in.\u000a\u000aDinner wouldn't be complete without dessert.  I've had my share of chocolate recently, so I went with the green tea waffle dessert.  You get two waffles, vanilla ice cream, and two small containers--one with warm honey and one with melted butter.  I used a bit of the butter and only a small amount of the honey.  The dessert was very good.  And as one person's review stated, it is very filling.\u000a\u000aService was great.  I was there when Kyara opened so there wasn't a crowd there.  I was served twice by one of two servers and I received some of the other dishes over the bar from one of the chefs.  They allowed me to stand and peer over the side of the counter so I could see them making sushi and one of the chefs was trying a new dressing for a salad.  Dinner was very tasty, service was excellent, and I will be back.

VI went with friends from the East last night.  I really like the decor of this pub.  Service was very good.  The server kept an eye on our glasses and brought replacement drinks as needed.\u000a\u000aI got the Shepherd's Pie.  Very tasty, and just the right amount of food.  This isn't one of those places where you're going to remark about huge portions.  They are just the right amount without overdoing the amount of food you get.  This Shepherd's Pie is made with the traditional ground lamb which gave it a rich flavor.  The two with me had fish and chips and bangers and Mash.  Both enjoyed their meals.\u000a\u000aI'd return here and try something else on the menu.  There are some good choices.

V*** Review is for Spring 2014 Restaurant Week Menu ***\u000a\u000aI enjoyed my dinner at Bacio when Chef Pellegrino was there and I've wanted to try Bratalian since she opneed the place.  I'm glad I did.\u000a\u000aSince I was alone, I opted to sit at the bar.  Besides not taking up a table meant for two or more, I often have a good time watching the bartenders do their thing.  In this case, I had a direct view into the small kitchen of this restaurant and I could see Chef Pellegrino's sister, Chef Alessandra Madeira, cooking with her staff.  The kitchen seemed to run well and there were some laughs coming from there.  They were also putting out a good number of meals.  There were several take out orders called in while I was there.\u000a\u000aThe three course Restaurant Week menu has a lot of choices.  For the starter, I chose the Polpette Tradizionale--two 6 ounce meatballs made with beef, pork, and veal in a fresh tomato and basil sauce.  What a large starter.  That could have been the meal.  The sauce was very good and the meatballs were soft in texture and had an excellent flavor.\u000a\u000aFor the main course, I chose the Salsicce and Pepperoni--Italian sausage, both hot and sweet, sautéed over red and yellow peppers and onions.  Another winning dish.  The onions and peppers were sautéed just enough to start to soften them but not enough to take some of the crispness away and turn them to mush.  The pieces of sausage were cooked nicely and were very tasty.  It was different to have the sausage served in bite sized pieces and I liked the main course a whole lot.  I did let some of the peppers go.  Can't fill up on fiber!\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I had ordered then Torta di ricotta--classic Italian ricotta cheesecake.  After having had ricotta cheesecake at several Italian restaurants recently, I am convinced that it's the only way cheesecake should be made--with ricotta and not cream cheese.  The texture of the ricotta cheesecake was excellent and the cheesecake was a perfect way to end the meal.\u000a\u000aService throughout was excellent.  My iced tea was refilled without having to ask.  One of the bus people removed any finished plates.  The staff worked as a team and they worked well together.\u000a\u000aA few notes:  If you arrive in the early evening, don't think they're not open.  There are wraps on the windows to shade the sun which the restaurant faces much of the day.  The restaurant itself is a small space, cozy, with interesting decorations including the clothes hanging from the line over the doorway area.  \u000a\u000aThis was a grand way to start Spring Restaurant Week.  I hope my other choices turn out this well!  A hearty thanks to Chef Madeira and the staff at Bratalian for a very pleasant dinner.

VAbsinthe is a great 90 minute show.  The acts are quite dazzling and daring--strong men doing amazing lifts and balancing, a roller skating couple, aerial act, and much more.  Think V Variety Theatre meets Zumantiy, with a zany MC, the Gazillionaire, and his peppy sidekick, Penny.\u000a\u000aWhen I entered the beer garden area, open to the public, I was intrigued by the decor or lack thereof.  Bathtubs made into seats, assorted lights and letters to spell the name of the beer garden, whimsical lights--it has a little of everything.\u000a\u000aIf you know someone who can get you a VIP ticket, take it.  I was VIP last night.  You get to enter a private lounge.  Access is through a green telephone booth.  Once you show your ticket, you step into the booth, pick up the phone, and when someone on the other side picks up, say anything you want.  He'll let you into the VIP area.  There's another bar in there and you get 1 free drink ticket with the VIP seating.  I had a great time chatting with people from out of town.  And, it's a relaxing area decorated in an eccentric manner a bit muted compared to the outside garden.\u000a\u000aVIP ticket holders are allowed into the circular building first, so this guarantees you the seat of your choice.  I took a front row seat, and it was great.  Being the 3rd person in the theatre has its perks.  I was also "picked on" by the Gazzilionaire a bit.  All in good fun and for lots of laughs--no lap dance from Penny.\u000a\u000aThe acts are dazzling.  The performers are very talented.  The show is almost exactly 90 minutes.  The seats are wood, so they begin to feel uncomfortable after awhile.  They are also hooked together with lock ties so you can't get a bit more room from your neighbor.  This is because the stage is relatively small and the performers are coming in and out through small aisles.\u000a\u000aI highly recommend this show.  What an addition to the lineup of shows in Las Vegas.  At $69 before taxes and fees, this show is less expensive than many on the Strip.  Go and enjoy!

VThis is the third time that I've done AYCE sushi and this was very, very good.  Tremendous selection of nigiri sushi and they had some specials on the board that were good.  \u000a\u000aI sat at the sushi bar and almost immediately Freda, one of the sushi chefs, started to ask me questions and to suggest things.  I ordered the first three nigiri selections and then he made some recommendations from there.  Throughout my dinner, he was very helpful and very pleasant!\u000a\u000aHere's a list of what I had.  All are nigiri except where noted:\u000a\u000aGarlic tuna\u000aHamachi\u000aOctopus\u000aConch\u000aCajun tuna\u000aMasago jalapeño (forgot the quail egg, Paolo, but I'll remember next time.\u000aCrab (snow) meat\u000aSweet shrimp \u000aSalmon belly\u000aSpicy shrimp and Scallop yum yum hand rolls\u000aCold tofu with 3 condiments\u000aGrilled salmon and grilled white tuna\u000aGreen tea crème brulée\u000aGreen tea cake\u000aChocolate mousse\u000aTempura ice cream\u000a\u000aChef Freda saw how much I enjoyed the grilled white tuna so he made me the sushi version of it nigiri style.\u000a\u000aService was great.  I felt very comfortable for my first time here, and I started to learn more about how to order and what to look for.  I also took his suggestions several times especially when he recommended the heads be removed from my sweet shrimp nigiri and then eaten in the soup they make.  The shrimp heads and soup were superb!

VI read the reviews on Yelp, but I was glad I reread them before attempting to find the place.  It is in the convenience mart called Sparky's at the corner of Twain and Durango.  Had I not read that, I would have been driving back and forth and wondering where Thrifty's was.\u000a\u000aI ordered a 2 scoop cup of coconut pineapple.  I do like the fact they have so many flavors.  The ice cream was good, but I didn't think it was anything special that would cause me to come back here for that.  What will bring me back is they make a cookie sandwich from any ice cream you choose.  Now that's intriguing and I'll have to try that sometime.

VI went to Insert Coins for the Iron Chef viewing party with Jet Tila, executive chef at Wazuzu at Encore.  I hadn't been here before, but I had read the reviews.\u000a\u000aI am not a fanatic gamer.  I'd much rather play pinball any day and they do have a few pinball machines in the back. \u000a\u000aNot being a drinker, the bar lacks interest for me so the whole set up would not be a destination for me.  I can see where it would be a fun place to go if you sat at the bar and had some drinks and conversation.\u000a\u000aThis is one more Fremont East bar that has tried to distinguish itself from the others with the arcade games.

VI was at Theatre7 last night for the play Oscar: A Good Man.  The theatre is in a small building.   The set up was padded, folding chairs for about 40 people, much like a black box in a theatre.\u000a\u000aThere is a projection screen on a wall at the back of a small stage.  Last night, this was used for showing some video that was intertwined with the live actors.\u000a\u000aIn addition, being in the Arts District, Theatre7 opens as an art gallery on First Fridays.  It has a large number of art works hanging with artists' names and prices.\u000a\u000aThe place is quite nice, and I look forward to seeing some films there.  The name comes from $7 for 7PM start time for all movies.  I'll be back at the end of the month for a screening of the owner's film, I. M. Caravaggio.\u000a\u000aThe artistic director for Theatre7 is a very pleasant man who greeted everyone last night.  He also portrayed Oscar Goodfellow in last night's show.

VWhen I was unable to open the front door to get into O'Aces, I should have recognized it as a sign that breakfast at O'Aces should not happen!  I pulled on the door several times, and then I walked out the entry way to see if there was another entrance.  No, there wasn't.  Back to the door.  A few more hard yanks and someone from inside came and opened the door.  I had gone brain dead over the fact that video poker bars/restaurants like this lock their doors for the overnight and morning hours as a precaution.  I never thought to look for the buzzer nor was there a sign anywhere saying to use same.  \u000a\u000aI did get in, however, and the first thing that hit me was the smell of cigarette smoke both stale and fresh and there was only one customer in the place.  From the reviews, I had expected some, but I got a full shot.  I walked into the restaurant area.  Under the Nevada Clean Indoor Act these places were to be separated from the smoking bar areas with enclosures.  They had the doors, but they were wide open.  Perhaps the the Legislature changing the law during its last session, O'Aces may not need to have the area sealed from the bar.\u000a\u000aThe waitress brought my menu.  There was a limited number of items on the breakfast section and I chose the 4 egg sausage and cheese omelette.  I got hash browns and my choice of toast was their sourdough.  Coffee was brought quickly and was refilled once during the time I was there although I was asked a second time.  Since I was fooling with my phone, the waitress asked if I needed more time before ordering and I said, "Yes."  She left and then it was a wait for her to come back.  I think she knew I was a special case (see getting in the front door above.)\u000a\u000aThe order was placed and then I waited.  About 15 minutes later, when I was thinking that I had certainly made the wrong decision in choosing O'Aces, the cook brought my breakfast to the table.  He then looked for the waitress because I think he'd been waiting for her to come pick up the order.  Now, there still are only two customers in the place--me and the guy smoking and drinking at the bar.\u000a\u000aThe omelette was OK.  Nothing special.  It was like they cooked one small sausage link, cut it into small pieces, and then mixed it with canned cheese and put it on the omelette before folding and plating.  It was no 4 egg omelette.  I've made bigger with only two eggs.  It was filling and it got me revved for the Make A Wish Run so it fulfilled its purpose.\u000a\u000aI then had to wait a fair amount of time for the check to be brought.  There were still only two people in the place, me and...well you know who.  I put bills in the check holder and I got up and walked toward the bar where the waitress was in deep conversation with the guy at the bar.  That's what had kept her from doing her other work in a timely manner.  I handed her the folder, made my way to the door, pressed the button to unlock the door (see I'm eminently trainable), and out I was into the fresh air.\u000a\u000aI made a mistake going there and I knew it at the front door.  Live and learn!

VAfter a hike yesterday, we stopped here for their lunch buffet.  It was almost empty when we arrived but we must have been a draw because business picked up while we were there.\u000a\u000aThey brought us ice water and we ordered garlic naan.  In fact, we ordered a second basket of garlic naan before we even started with the first.  It was quite good.\u000a\u000aThe first part of the buffet had all vegetarian dishes.  Some of the standouts here were the  pakoras, large triangles filled with a spicy mix of vegetables, and the saag.  The saag had excellent flavorings and was very tasty.  I also tried some of the lentils and they were also good.\u000a\u000aIn the second section, I had some goat curry, chicken tikka masala, and tandoori chicken.  The chicken tikka masala was standard as was the goat curry.  The tandoori chicken was a bit dry.\u000a\u000aA couple of things I noted that were different.  There is no silverware on the table.  You pick up utensils at the buffet when you're there or you go back and get if you forget.  I was expecting some kind of MTV India music playing or video,  but they had their TV off which was quite OK.  But instead, we had pop music which just didn't seem to fit the place.\u000a\u000aThe room is pleasant, service was OK, and the lunch buffet was good.  There are a few standout items as mentioned.  I didn't have dessert, not even kheer, which almost unheard of for me.  The naan filled me up quite nicely along with two plates of food.

VTo all previous Yelp friends who reviewed Carlos' Kitchen--THANK YOU!  I was aware of Chef Carlos when he was at the other place a few blocks away but never went there.  After being reminded of him by Susie H.'s recent review, this was on my to try list ASAP.\u000a\u000aWe arrived early last night (Sunday) after the Ribbon of Life show at the Smith Center.  We were the only ones in the place.  The server told us to sit anywhere we liked and she handed us the menus after we were seated.  Before leaving, she read the specials of the day.  There were two dinners, a wrap, and I believe a salad special.  She had me hooked with the first thing she read--bleu cheese pasta with steak!  I ordered that and my wife ordered Chicken Angelina.\u000a\u000aThe bleu cheese pasta was made with penne rigate and the steak was grilled, sliced, and placed in strips on top of the pasta.  The bleu cheese sauce was exceptional.  A great bleu cheese bite with every taste and there was extra bleu cheese crumbles spread on the pasta.  My wife chicken Angelina was a seared chicken breast served on top of garlic spinach and mashed potatoes with large pieces of mushroom.  It was topped with artichoke and there was a dijon cream sauce.  She enjoyed it a lot!\u000a\u000aAlthough we were both full, we had our minds set on having dessert we had looked at online earlier in the day.  She got a chocolate molten lava cake and I got the chef's indulgence.  Both were outstanding!!!  The menu describes the indulgence this way:  A Cheesecake Spring Roll, Crunchy Bites of Brownie and Mini Banana's Foster Cheesecakes, served with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Fresh Strawberries and House Made Berry, Caramel & Fudge Sauces.  For the single version there's one brownie bite and one mini bananas Foster, but that's more than enough.  There are sweetened tortilla strips on the bottom of the plate.  This is one of the most creative desserts I've seen.  \u000a\u000aChef Carlos came to the table twice to check on us and we chatted about the food and what he'd done since he moved to this newer spot.  The restaurant is almost completely closed from the VP bar so there's almost no smoke smell from the bar coming into the restaurant.  I can really see this place coming onto our rotation list of places to go again and again.  I'll call and ask the specials before I go.  What a wonderful gem hidden away in this video poker bar!  And, what a fantastic and creative chef Carlos is.  He cares about his food and his customers.

VWe saw Celine two times when she was here with the first show "A New Day" and planned on seeing her show after she returned to the Colosseum.  Last night was the night.\u000a\u000aThe show is very different from A New Day and it is excellent!  They have expanded the LED panel at the rear of the stage with projection screens on both sides of the stage.  That increases the amount of projection space available and it's put to good use in several sequences.\u000a\u000aThe biggest change with the show is the amazing 26 piece orchestra.  They are excellent and it gives a completely different feel to her show from the smaller band with few or no strings.  She sings a few of her standards--I was glad she did a bit of "It's All Coming Back To Me Now" as it's one of my favorite songs that she does.  The show is also different because the dancers are gone.  There is an intimate little combo set with music different from what you'd think of Celine.  The performers showcased while she was changing were also good--the violinist, some of her vocalists, etc.  \u000a\u000aThe planned encore was "My Heart Will Go On" from the movie "Titanic."  There was a time when I was so sick of hearing this song, I thought I'd slash my wrists if I ever heard it again.  Last night, I was missing it for some odd reason.  As the encore, it's really well done and a fantastic end to a good show.\u000a\u000aA few things to note:  Celine never starts on time.  I've seen her 4 times at the Colosseum and she's started ten minutes (at least) late each time.  That's partly because Las Vegas audiences are notoriously late and we don't start without them and shut them outside until there's a break.  Colosseum people take note.  Start on time and seat late comers whenever.  I saw one person enter 45 minutes into a 90 minute show!  Way to go _ _ _.\u000a\u000aThe show will be here for a few more years and I can't imagine that we won't be going back to see it again.  And although it's been two years since Celine returned to Las Vegas at the Colosseum, I can say bon rétour à notre Québécoise.

VAfter reading the good reviews on Yelp, I decided to give Pan Asian a try.  Wow!  Fantastic!  They have DUCK.  I had the duck curry.  It was a very large portion with crispy duck skin on the outside and juicy duck meat beneath that crispy skin.  Look at the photo I posted to see the size of the meal.  Fantastic!\u000a\u000aIt's a red curry with pineapple chunks, red and green bell pepper, some white grapes, some tomato chucks, and mint leaves.  I asked for a spiciness of 7 and I ended up putting some more spices on to give it the kind of kick I like.\u000a\u000aI so wanted to try the fried cheesecake for dessert but since I finished all the duck, I just didn't have room for dessert.\u000a\u000aAs stated by Ken, the husband and wife operate the restaurant with him being the server and her the cook.  They are delightful people who are very friendly.\u000a\u000aI'll be back often because they have DUCK along with a lot of other good things, I'm sure.  Next time--dessert!

VPan Asian stays 5 stars for me.  I went back tonight.  It's amazing that the owners could remember me and what I ordered from one visit over a month ago.\u000a\u000aI ordered Red Curry chicken with spice level of 8 and it was excellent.  My wife had the Garlic Pepper Sauce with chicken and she enjoyed it immensely.  We shared wonton soup for a starter and we also somewhat shared dessert--tempura cheesecake.  It was rich and oh so flavorful and David promised low in calories.  :-)\u000a\u000aThis is a special place with owners who are just so pleasant!

VI found the Drago Sisters Bakery, I found the Drago Sisters Bakery.  I want to keep shouting it!\u000a\u000aOn the way back to the freeway from Lazy Joe's Fish and Chips, I saw this small shop in a plaza when it was too late to stop.  I made a decision to do a U at the light at the freeway (perfectly legal), and I doubled back and was thrilled when they were open.  I think I put on a few pounds just looking at those delightful pastries in the cases.\u000a\u000aAfter getting a sample of the mini très leches, I was hooked.  She reeled me right in with that freebie.  It's heaven!  I got 4 items to go--3 cake truffles; one red velvet, one coconut, and one pumpkin.  I couldn't let the 4th little area go empty so I got a mini très leches to round out the container.  Wow!  Everything is so good.\u000a\u000aI think my tongue touched the floor when I saw the red velvet cheesecake.  A word of advice:  the sisters are on the wrong side of Rainbow for many people.  Try not to go here on a Friday evening at 5 PM!  It took me three lights to get on the freeway, but my lovelies are sitting in the refrigerator to be consumed judiciously and with great relish!\u000a\u000aThanks, Ken!!!

VI really like Tivoli Village, and it will be even better when it's finished.  There are several stores open now, but none that I want to shop at.  What interests me now are the restaurants and the food places.  As more places come to the complex, there may be some places that are of interest to me.\u000a\u000aIn the interim, I'll be back to enjoy dinner at one of the two places open (Brio Tuscan Grille and Petra) and a gelato place plus Leone Cafe.  I'm a sucker for gelato and coffee.  Tivoli, I'll be back--soon!

VI stopped in for the first time today to get some Bon Bread that I didn't get Wednesday at the nearby Farmer's Market.  Bon was in the Land Rover store along with several other vendors including a dried fruit company, Gilcrease Orchards with produce, two other local growers, and others.  There are also some Land Rovers to look at that have been backed to the far end of the store.  They also had a $20,000 BMW motorcycle is was going to dicker about, but I decided I didn't need it.  :-)\u000a\u000aThe stands along the street had some nice things but nothing in which I was interested.  Leone Cafe was really hopping with business and it was a pleasant morning to be walking about.\u000a\u000aI'll be back - earlier in the day.  This will really be grand when temperatures come down a bit.

VI wanted to have lunch and try something different and Viva Las Arepas came to mind.  As I drove down Sahara, I was wondering if it was wise of me to go here today when we were having a sprinkling of rain and take a chance of sitting outside in 50 degree temperature or else eating in the car.  What a surprise to find they had moved from their small stand with no interior except for cooking and serving into their own strip mall store!  \u000a\u000aHaving read my good friend Holly's Yelp review, I knew I was going to get the pork arepa.  That and a can of diet Coke came to $4.99 plus tax--a great price for a good lunch.  After placing the order, the woman at the counter said they'd bring my lunch to the table and she told me to sit anywhere I wanted.\u000a\u000aThe sandwich came quickly along with three plastic bottles--one with mayonnaise, and the other two with their sauce, one spicy and one mild.  They're in mustard/ketchup kind of plastic squeeze bottles with the mayo in white, the mild sauce in the yellow container, and the spicy one in red!  Appropriate.  I tried some of the spicy sauce and I was hooked!\u000a\u000aI wish I had taken a bit more time to really savor this wonderful sandwich but I snorted a few times and it was gone!  The pork was very flavorful and tender, and the arepas dough was cooked very well.  This was my first time having one but it will not be my last.  I have to go back and try some of the other things.  It's too good of a place to pass up anymore.  And now with an indoor restaurant, I won't stay away because it's over 100 out and I won't have to worry about a few raindrops on my head!\u000a\u000aViva Las Arepas!

VI stopped here for lunch today after having my car serviced and I have to stick with my 5 star review from before.  The gentleman who took my order was really friendly and answered my questions about the drinks.  \u000a\u000aI ordered a Reina Pepiada, an arepa made with shredded chicken breast, avocado, mayo, and cilantro.  I also got a coconut and cheese pastelito for a dessert.  For my drink, I had asked the clerk about the Malta Polar, a Venezuelan soda, made with molasses instead of sugar.  He said he liked it and I gave it a try.  It was tasty--a bit strong--but it was curiously refreshing.  Wait, that one's taken!  It was very good and it was a good accompaniment for lunch.\u000a\u000aWhen he brought my food, he also brought the three squeeze bottles of sauces.  The red bottle--this is a nice spicy sauce that gave the arepas some kick.  The yellow bottle had a spicy cilantro sauce and this too had a kick.  The white bottle had the mild sauce, but it was OK.  I tried it and then went back to the premium grades.\u000a\u000aCoconut and cheese seemed an odd combination to me, but I love coconut, so I had to give this a go.  What a pleasant treat!  The cheese mixed with the coconut had a symbiotic relationship and they went well together.\u000a\u000aI guess I'll just have to make it a more common experience to drive the few miles from my car dealership after service and have lunch here!\u000a\u000aViva Las Arepas and Viva Las Vegas!

VThis isn't the normal Firehouse Subs I go to, but I was in the area.  Service was fast--there was no one in the shop but me.\u000a\u000aThe tuna sub was as good as I get at the normal shop.  \u000a\u000aI am a fan.

VThe show is great!  There's no new, ground-breaking magic here.  You will have a fun time and enjoy the magic.  I thought I had seen enough magic shows to me "magic-ed out."  But, Hammer is such a genial and funny guy that you just sit back, laugh, and enjoy every moment of this show.\u000a\u000aHammer engages the audience and he has a very quick mind.  Last night's show was attended mostly by tourists in Las Vegas.  It's always fun to watch tourists participating in shows like this.  What happens here goes home in photos taken by friends and family members.\u000a\u000aWhile there are a few double entendre references, the show is good for almost all ages.  You will enjoy yourself if you see this show.  Hammer is a very talented guy!

VWhat a disappointment!  With all the great things said about this place by people's whose reviews I respect, I thought it would be better than it was.  I just barely give 3 stars.  I was contemplating two and a half.\u000a\u000aI was greeted promptly on arrival and asked if I was getting take out or eating in.  The woman told me to sit anywhere I wanted because I was eating in and she gave me their small menu.  I had seen several people rave about the curry chicken with roti so that's what I ordered.  In a short time, the cook brought out a bowl of curry chicken and a plate with three very hot, fresh roti.  \u000a\u000aThe curry chicken was good but it would be better named curry potato with chicken and roti.  I had two large chunks of potato, one large cube of chicken (smaller that either of the two potato pieces), while the rest was curry sauce with some chicken shreds.  The curry was tasty and the roti were very good.\u000a\u000aAs I waited for my dinner to be brought, I noticed on their wall--which has a lot of homemade signs for new dishes--that the curry chicken was listed under appetizers.  No wonder the price is only $4.95.  No wonder the portion is much less than a curry chicken you'd get in a Thai restaurant, and for $4.95 I wasn't expecting that.\u000a\u000aI was going to order something else, perhaps some ramen or just a pudding for dessert.  There were two customers including myself in this small place that has a maximum capacity of 68 people.  All the time I waited for my order and ate, the woman was on the phone--not taking orders--but chatting.  If she wasn't on the phone, she was putting business cards in a plastic holder in a notebook and she was engrossed with that task rather than all two of her customers--the other who ordered directly from the cook and had no interaction with the woman.\u000a\u000aAfter waiting approximately five minutes for her to get off the phone or at least look my way so I could get her attention, I got up to leave.  I approached the counter and she told whomever was on the phone to hold, she took, my money, gave me change, and went back to her telephone.\u000a\u000aI don't think I'll return.  If it's like this when they're two people there, what would it be like when they're busy--say ten people.  It's just not worth it.  And as for dessert, I drove up Spring Mountain Road and stopped at McDonald's and had a McFlurry!  Better than her pudding I'd be willing to wager even sight unseen!

VI was here tonight for the Yelp book club's bi-monthly get together.  It wasn't the best place to meet because the music, albeit nice, was a bit loud to hear everyone as we discussed our book.\u000a\u000aI got an iced chai tea latte that was tasty.  It could have used a bit more chai flavor.  None of us got any pastries, so I can't comment on them although they looked very nice.\u000a\u000aI like Leone a lot.  If you're having your coffee in house, they give you a number and deliver it to your table.  I can see coming back here in the early evening, sitting on the patio, sipping a latte and people watching.  There is a lot of room at the outdoor patio.\u000a\u000aThe place could garner an extra star when I go back with a great coffee and some good pastry.  We'll see.

VI can only offer a limited review of The Martini.  I was here Tuesday night for the Yelp Book Club meeting.  They have a very nice dining room to the left of the bar when you come in that's almost a separate room.\u000a\u000aWe only had drinks during the club.  The server was very polite and prompt, and he returned to ask if we wanted more of what we had ordered.  I looked at the bar menu and the dessert menu and they have a nice selection.\u000a\u000aTip for Yelpers--check the menu.  There's a number to text a word to, all shown on the menu, and you'll get a free dessert from their menu.  That was enough to hook me and I'm planning to go back and have dinner there.  I hope to be able to raise my star rating an extra one.

VI was here in January for our Yelp Book Club meeting and we decided to have our last meeting of this year at the Martini again.  I came an hour early and had dinner.  \u000a\u000aThe dining room is small in width but runs the length of the building.  There's a nice wooden wall with some fireplaces that block the dinging room from the bar section and makes a great spot for our book club meetings.\u000a\u000aI started with the Caesar salad.  Good dressing with nice croutons.  There was a lot of salad.  It wasn't a starter salad but rather like a dinner salad without meat.\u000a\u000aFor my main course, I ordered the chicken scaloppine.  While the menu says it's a chicken breast with artichoke, mushrooms, and prosciutto there was no artichoke.  The breast was very lightly breaded and fried and served with seasonal vegetables and risotto.  The dish was very good.  The artichoke would have added some to it, but it stood the way it was very well.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, how could I resist the deep fried Oreos with ice cream?  Four battered and deep fried Oreos and a martini glass of ice cream.  It was very good, but the Oreos lose something in the deep frying.  The creamy inside got lost with the fried crust of the batter.  If someone should offer me this again, I wouldn't turn them down.\u000a\u000aMy server was named Princess.  She was very good.  Great personality and good service.  She kept my iced tea filled all during my meal.  \u000a\u000aAs I was tackling dessert, one of our club members arrived and we were soon discussion our book about living in a Mumbai slum.  I felt somewhat guilty.

VWe generally go the the Grand Café when we're eating at Red Rock and today was no different.  I had the Southwest Chicken salad which has a great dressing with a lot of cilantro.  My other favorite is their California Cobb salad.  My wife had their Chicken Supreme sandwich and that's always good for her.  \u000a\u000aThe Café is pricey compared to some of their other in casino cafés.  Service can be tough, but we usually ask for Jose or Yuan.  They are both top notch and treat us well.

VI really like the Royal House.  I was there for a comedy show last night and I saw the changes that many Yelpers had mentioned.  The pianist in the entrance foyer was very good and it was relaxing waiting for my friends to join me.  The new mini art gallery just to the left of the entrance was really nice!\u000a\u000aThere's a showroom on the second floor that has recently been created.  Who knew?  The comedy show was good, and I'll probably come back after they get a little more experience under their belts.\u000a\u000aBarrymores looks like a restaurant I'll try.  The Royal House is really with it!

VOnce again a big thanks to my fellow Yelpers for steering me to a great spot for something different.\u000a\u000aI went to Crepe Expectations today for breakfast.  I looked at the breakfast crepe and decided on the Rosarito although I was tempted to ditch a breakfast crepe and go with sweet.  But, I was good and stayed with the breakfast one.  The Rosarito is filled with chorizo--nicely seasoned with a small kick from the spices, scrambled egg, guacamole, and jack cheese.  With it, I had a very large, tasty cup of coffee.\u000a\u000aWhile waiting for the server to bring your crepe, you can watch them make it on the large flat panel above the cooking stations.  There are three crepe making griddles and the two to the left are shown on the flat panel.\u000a\u000aMy experience with the good food and with the friendly, helpful staff will assure I'll be back for a dessert crepe.\u000a\u000aThere are outdoor tables with umbrellas for eating out.  This morning was cool enough it would have been good.  However, I saw the dog water dispenser and dog treats and I opted to stay in.  I am not dog friendly when I'm eating--inside or out.

VThis is a much overlooked Starbucks at the eastern edge of McCarran by Russell and Eastern.\u000a\u000aThere is a drive through which can present a problem when it's busy.  The drive through cars waiting can sometimes block the parking spots.\u000a\u000aThe inside has many tables and it's laid out quite well.

VI had breakfast at Harry's before watching the Dragon Boat races at Lake Las Vegas this morning.  The breakfast menu is somewhat limited.  I decided to get Harry's Frittata.  On their menu, they describe it as "a hearty wedge of Italian omelet topped with chicken, mushrooms, onions, peppers and rosemary."  The description fits well.\u000a\u000aThe frittata was cooked nicely and the toppings all tasted good.  It came with hash browns and choice of toast.  I also ordered coffee.\u000a\u000aService was prompt and friendly.  Courtney was very pleasant and efficient.  I enjoyed the breakfast.\u000a\u000aIt was nice coming back after so many years of being away and the casino being closed.

VThis was really an excellent meal.  I went to Anthony's last night and I'm so glad I did.  I had the 18 ounce, bone in filet done black and blue.  \u000a\u000aFirst, the bread basket they bring you has a trio of breads from which to choose.  There was sesame lavash, raisin bread, and regular sliced French bread.  With it, they brought butter that had some olive oil on it to give it extra flavor and they ground sea salt on the butter.  Yay!\u000a\u000aThe steak was exactly the way I like it--charred and cool inside.  Just walk the cow through the kitchen!  On the plate were some small greens making a small salad, a small broiled tomato half, and a grilled pearl onion.  I ordered for a side the tater tots with bacon and cheese.  These little critters are excellent.  Grated potato formed into small barrels around some bacon and cheese and then fried.  Delicious!\u000a\u000aI ordered the chocolate soufflé for dessert at the beginning so my server would have the chef start it as I was nearing the end of my steak.  I needed to get to the other side of Las Vegas for a show, and I was beginning to worry about the time I had to get there.  It turned out to be fine.\u000a\u000aThe wait for the soufflé was well worth it.  There was a rich chocolate flavor and with the soufflé there was a small pitcher of chocolate sauce with small round chocolate crisps.  I opened the soufflé and poured in some of that good sauce.  The whole thing is highly addictive and may be on a controlled substance list somewhere.\u000a\u000aMy server was Leon and he was great.  Someone was there to refill iced tea, refill my water glass or remove dirty plates.  The room is very modern and I sat at a window table on the side and enjoyed watching the folks below who were coming back from the pool.\u000a\u000aOne of my better steak experiences in Las Vegas.

VThe Suncoast Showroom is one of the "classic" Las Vegas showrooms with tables seating 6 or 8 people 3 or 4 on each side.  There are also a number of booths that seat 4 at the back of each Tier.\u000a\u000aThe showroom is sectioned into three Tiers.  More expensive seats are in Tier I and the cheaper seats are in Tier 3.  Since the showroom seats about 500 people, there really isn't a seat that's bad.  There are some seats that are more uncomfortable.  I generally go to the box office and buy a ticket for a seat that's at the railing of a Tier 3 table.  That way, there is no one's head in front of me to inhibit my view.\u000a\u000aSeating like this can be tight as the chairs are close together, but at most shows, the people around you move the chairs and all get to be a bit more comfortable.\u000a\u000aThe shows at the Suncoast tend to be entertainers who are older or who aren't as well known as some entertainers.  I have seen 23 shows in this room over the years, and while I like theatre seating better, the Suncoast is close to home and offers a good mix of entertainment from gray hairs like me.

VI just stopped into the Guinness Store and looked at their merchandise while waiting for friends.  It was OK, but I didn't see much that I'd be interested in buying.  I really don't need any more shirts although they have a great selection.\u000a\u000aThis is a good place to come and browse. If I were a tourist, I could easily see myself leaving with some kind of Las Vegas shirt to wear to impress my friends in the East, but those days are over.

VI've been having nigiri sushi lately and tonight I decided to have some rolls instead.  I've driven by Go Wild a number of times and I've seen their ad saying 50% off all rolls, all day, every day.  I generally shy away from places that may increase prices only to offer 50% off, but after reading the Yelp reviews, I decided to give Go Wild a try.\u000a\u000aI ordered two rolls--the baked Langostino lobster on a California roll and the Kiss of Fire.  The menu describes the baked langostino roll as baked baby lobster, mushroom with dynamite sauce on Cali roll and the Kiss of Fire as Inside-Shrimp tempura, spicy shrimp, cucumber. Ouside-spicy soft shell crab, albacore, jalapeno topping, extra spicy ponzu sauce.\u000a\u000aBoth were excellent.  The presentation was great as any good sushi place should have.  The flavors of the lobster mixed with the California roll was very good.  The Kiss of Fire was aptly named.  It had spicy seasonings that gave it that kiss of fire, well a small fire.  I found that the rolls were so good the way they were that I used no soy sauce but merely used the wasabi.  I almost finished the portion they brought and almost asked for more so I could make more fire for myself.  As another reviewer said, they use a small amount of rice.  There isn't a huge amount used to make the roll look bigger than it is or to take the place of other ingredients.  \u000a\u000aI had a few more rolls on my to try list, but I decided not to pig out but stop at the two and have some dessert.  I got an order of tempura red bean ice cream.  It was a pleasant ending to a good meal.  There were three servers circulating through the restaurant that wasn't very busy.  They were attentive and even after bringing the check, asked me if I wanted another iced tea.\u000a\u000aI really liked the decor of the restaurant.  I'm not a fan of sitting at sushi bars, I've come to learn, so I sat at a table.  The music was reggae--odd for a sushi house--and the big screen TV had ESPN's Sports Nation.  It's amazing how good ESPN is when to you don't have to listen to a word of the drivel they're saying.  The TV was on mute so I watched the plays they were chatting about and tapped my feet  to the music.\u000a\u000aI'll be back and try some of the other rolls.

V4.5 stars\u000a\u000aI was hesitant to try this place given some of the early reviews, but I was hoping the new owners would make a go of it where several others have failed so we decided to give it a try tonight.  I'm so glad I did.\u000a\u000aWe were seated promptly--it was not busy--and our hostess asked if it was our first visit.  When we said yes, she explained some things about the food, the menu, and the restaurant.  She then left and got our iced teas.\u000a\u000aI ordered the new pollo con mole which is not the chicken listed on their online menu.  They recently replace the pollo limon with the pollo mole.  My wife ordered the pork Yucatan pibil.  With the meals came a soup or salad and we both got the black bean soup.  It had an excellent flavor, but there was one thing missing.  The soup is pureed black beans and I would have liked some chopped or whole beans for texture.  Still, it was very tasty.\u000a\u000aOur main dishes were excellent!  The mole on my chicken was rich and had great flavors.  I liked it because it wasn't heavy on the chocolate which I find with some restaurants.  My wife thoroughly enjoyed her pork Yucatan.  Portions were large enough we each could have brought some home for lunch tomorrow, but I, of course, pigged out and ate all of my chicken.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, we shared--sort of--a large piece of tres leches cake.  Yelpers note: with a check in and the purchase of an entree, you get a dessert.  They also have free wifi.\u000a\u000aService was excellent all night.  The manager came over and spoke with us about our dinners, and our iced tea was always refilled promptly.  \u000a\u000aI am so glad I gave Baja California a chance.  We will be back!

VFive Guys Burgers is an OK place.  I stopped here with four friends after being at Red Rock Canyon.  I have never been to a Five Guys and I didn't know what to expect.  The four people I was with had all been there and were fans.\u000a\u000aThey explained that the regular was a double patty so I ordered the "little" bacon cheeseburger.  I got my burger with lettuce, jalapeños, and grilled mushrooms.\u000aThe people I was with took care of ordering two medium fries for the five of us and that was plenty.\u000a\u000aThe burger was a nondescript piece of cooked, ground beef.   There was one half of a piece of lettuce that was only partly on the patty.  There were no mushrooms that I could see anywhere.  The bacon was crumbled pieces of bacon on the bottom bun under the burger, not the more common bacon slices you'd get at most places.\u000a\u000aThe fries were good. I liked the amount of salt they used.  Had I been ordering for myself, I would have ordered cajun fries but alas I wasn't.\u000a\u000aThe fact that they have free peanuts to snack on before the burger comes or after or to take a bag home with you didn't phase me at all.  I think I had three peanuts and that was good enough.\u000a\u000aThe place doesn't deserve a 2 star rating but I really hate to round it to three.  The fries will push it to a three.  Let's just say it's not a place to which I'd return!  Also, the music was BLARING!  It was awful!!!

VI looked on Yelp for a new breakfast place to try before going to the annual Run For a Wish 5K and I found Bobby and Misti's 5 star reviews for Del Mar.  That's more than good enough for me!\u000a\u000aI had the Man O' War Omelette.  It's an omelette filled with bacon, spinach, roasted red peppers, and jack cheese and topped with avocado.  With comes your choice of home fries, home fries with onion and pepper, or hash browns.  I chose the home fries with peppers and onion.  You also get choice of toast, biscuit or English muffin.  I went with the rye toast.\u000a\u000aThe omelette was large and very filling and the home fries were excellent.  I was glad I got the onion and peppers fried with the potatoes.  I chose rye toast.  While waiting for the breakfast to arrive, the owner and barista this morning, brought me a mini carrot cake muffin to start out and he made sure my coffee cup was filled.  \u000a\u000aI recommend this place highly.  It deserves all 5 stars.  Service is excellent, and the owner and his wife were very attentive and pleasant.  The horse racing theme is interesting.  On each table, there's a little call box.  On it are buttons for four things--service, drink, bill, or cancel.  If you press one of the buttons, a colored number lights on a board on the wall in the front of the restaurant.  The server can see if you need more drinks or want your bill.  The small box is like a mini KENO board.  There's also a drive through if you want to get a coffee or other drink from espresso bar and pick it up at the window.\u000a\u000aI will be back here to try lunch.  The menu has some very interesting things to try!

VI went to 28GO Monday evening for a UYE 5 course vegan dinner that was a farewell dinner for Jen F. who's leaving Las Vegas and moving to Milwaukee, WI.  (Go figure!)  :)  She arranged with the chef at 28GO to make a Prix Fixe dinner of five courses.  I'll use the chef's descriptions:\u000a\u000aCourse 1:  This was called Popeye's Revenge and was a spinach roll dressed with spicy garlic sesame and laced with sweet balsamic-soy glaze done to look like cuts of a sushi roll.  Tasty mushrooms in the spinach. good seasoning, and the plating was very well done.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/28go-the-restaurant-las-vegas?select=_sAqDGLULvhcj9kjhfKS8A#pKPj_Y4VjqiYU6s9sDYzGg\u000a\u000aCourse 2: This was a tofu poke martini which was lightly seared tofu cubes tossed in sesame-soy wasabi oil atop a seaweed salad mix.  It was a martini because the presentation was in a martini glass.  The tofu was excellent--a nice crisp outside and great tasting dressing. \u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/28go-the-restaurant-las-vegas?select=_sAqDGLULvhcj9kjhfKS8A#XygDeqRJb33GticwMFhMoA\u000a\u000aCourse 3: This course was named grilled vegetable Napoleon with a blue agave glazed grilled assorted vegetables with cabernet vinaigrette and tamarind-miso paint.  The vegetables were eggplant, onions, and bell pepper and it was plated beautifully to resemble the layers in a Napoleon.  Again, seasoning was well done.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/28go-the-restaurant-las-vegas?select=_sAqDGLULvhcj9kjhfKS8A#tz7L0Wj-nOMw9xZPq63Bkw\u000a\u000aCourse 4: 28Gp kimchee o-nigiri which is the house kimchee rice triangles with portabella mushrooms and salt cured cold tofu.  This was my favorite of the night.  I really liked the spiciness of the rice and the salt with the tofu was superb!\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/28go-the-restaurant-las-vegas?select=_sAqDGLULvhcj9kjhfKS8A#1ttjaX7efdZkIM2ObksT8w\u000a\u000aCourse 5: White Rabbit is made from imported Thai coconut milk ice cream rolled inside a white mochi quilt.  The ice cream was very flavorful and the quilt was tasty, too!\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/28go-the-restaurant-las-vegas?select=_sAqDGLULvhcj9kjhfKS8A#GYCMqWYG39oSp5RXEo_f6w\u000a\u000aIn addition, I had for a drink a 28GO coconut cream fizz with tapioca pearls.  This is a non-alcoholic drink that was refreshing and added to the meal.\u000a\u000aThe food was excellent, the plating was well thought out given the names for the dishes, and service was excellent!  I found the meal filling and I'd really like to go back and try the place again.  I thought the meal was a bit pricey given there was no animal protein and even organic vegetables wouldn't merit the price we paid.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant is a small place behind the Rebel Book Store across Maryland Parkway from campus.  Monday night was a great evening.  There was no one else there besides the 10 of us for awhile.\u000a\u000aGood luck, Jen.

VKevin Burke is a very funny man!  His Fitz of Laughter is quite good.  He has developed a wonderful way of asking a few questions of some audience members, and with his quick wit, turning these answers into funny comments that engage the entire audience.  All is in good fun--well except for the time the girl got a cell phone call during a performance.\u000a\u000aBurke is introduced as the world's only psychic comedian and his act weaves comedy and illusions.  There is a good amount of audience participation and there is much laughter.\u000a\u000aWithout giving anything away, I would assume that Burke gets yearly tetanus shots and has a supply of bandages nearby during each performance.  \u000a\u000aI have seen this show several times, and although some of the things are the same, I always laugh with the audience seeing it for the first time, and I come away with a big smile because the one hour show has been so much fun!\u000a\u000aThe showroom is small and it lends itself to Burke's performance quite nicely.  The showroom is on the second floor of Fitzgerald's Hotel and Casino on "Freakmont Street."\u000a\u000aOne of my favorite parts of the show is Burke playing the kazoo and the audience singing along.  "You know, if they wanted to get off the island, all they had to do was........"   Well, you're going to have to see the show to know what I'm talking about.  I'm not going to ruin it in a review.\u000a\u000aGo see this show.  You won't be disappointed!

VThis is a normal Starbucks store and it was a great stop yesterday after a bike ride along the Flamingo Arroyo Trail.\u000a\u000aThe place was really busy this Thanksgiving morning, but all the baristas worked quickly and the wait time was short.\u000a\u000aI had a good drink, a slice of gingerbread loaf, and some wifi. I checked my email and FB.\u000a\u000aThis is a good outlet.  It's far from my home turf in Las Vegas, but when I'm riding the trail again, this will be one of my stops along the way!

VAfter the Great Santa Run, I needed a quick fix of caffeine.  I was on my way downtown to see a play at Theatre7, so this was a good stop.  The staff was pleasant albeit not quite with it.  After charging me for the gingerbread loaf I wanted, they discovered they were out of it.  Asking for a refund on my Starbucks card seemed out of the question, so I got a replacement.\u000a\u000aThe drink was good and I was on my way after checking some email and FB posts.

VThis was my 4th time stopping at Lobster ME to see if they had any lobster ice cream and to my complete amazement, they did have some.  They were not out as they were the last three times.  I am persistent if nothing else.\u000a\u000aSince the place opened, I've been intrigued by the idea of lobster ice cream so I had to give it a try.  There is one serving size, a dish with vanilla ice cream with mixed in lobster pieces and a larger frozen piece of lobster as a topper.\u000a\u000aThe ice cream was not very creamy.  It had a crumbly texture.  The lobster flavor was not evident until it warmed a bit--they opened a new 5 gallon container--so it was quite frozen.  Now and then, you get a piece of lobster that has a salty taste.  \u000a\u000aIn the end, I rate this as just OK.  It's certainly worth a try once.  The prices here are high with the lobster ice cream being just under $10 including tax.  That's a lot of froyo at other places around town.  Considering that the cheapest lobster sandwich is $17, this is the least expensive lobster treat at this place.\u000a\u000aThere are some round tables and I was able to people watch--one of my favorite hobbies on a Saturday night in Las Vegas.  The number of people buying their frozen yard and 1/2 yard drinks was funny.\u000a\u000aI'm sure I won't be back.  This was a one time try.  I'm just glad I was there once when they weren't out.

V3.5 stars\u000a\u000aNot quite up to a 4 star, but pretty close to it.  I went to the restaurant and ordered take out in person.  I ran into a bit of the language problem Holly mentioned in her review but it wasn't a big problem.  We ordered asparagus chicken and Hunan beef.  I got the beef extra spicy.  Of course, my wife's was gringa--no spice to speak of in the asparagus chicken.  She liked her meal except the asparagus was a bit woody.  My Hunan beef was excellent and it had the extra spiciness I wanted.\u000a\u000aI can see coming back here and now that I've ordered in person, I'd call and pre-order.  It's only a mile from home so it's no big deal.  The wait in person was about 10 minutes and I got 3 stars on two Angry Birds levels.

VWe decided we'd get something different for dinner and I was off to Buldogis which has been on my radar for a few months.  Driving out of Village Square one evening, I spied Buldogis so now I knew where to go.\u000a\u000aFor the two of us, I got a Smoked dog, an Angry dog, a small regular fries, and an order of Euro special fries.  I enjoyed the small amount of heat with my Angry dog.  I'd say it was more of an irritated dog than angry.  Perhaps I should have added jalapeño slices so my dog was a bit more angry.\u000a\u000aMy wife liked her Smoked dog.  The slaw and garlic mayo were very good.  The Euro fries were tasty too. \u000a\u000aI was so glad I got things to go.  There is so much topping on the dogs that it gets your hands full of liquid and toppings as they are squeezed off the dog no matter how gently you hoist that doggie!  That's not a problem.  It's just that I'm glad I could be sloppy in the privacy of mine own home rather than dribbling in public.\u000a\u000aOne downer--in looking at the photos, I saw Vegas J's photo of some bread pudding she'd had for dessert.  No dice.  They don't do desserts anymore.  Oh well, I still have a few 'Lette macarons from my last trip to LA so I had a Plan B that was quite good.\u000a\u000aThe order was made quickly and the counter guy was very helpful and polite.  Everything was A-OK!

VWe had our bimonthly Yelp Book Club meeting at Holley's Cuppa tonight.  I had an iced Chai tea latte.  It was excellent!  The space is great for a small group to gather and discuss.  The staff is very friendly and efficient.\u000a\u000aYou can have a single grind coffee made for you. There are jars with different beans and you can get the aroma of the beans and choose.  They then grind enough for one cup and you have it.  I'll have to try that next time.\u000a\u000aThe staff cut up two of their pastries and brought them to us to try.  They were great!  I bought a couple of scones and I know I'll be back when I'm in this area although it's out of the way for me.\u000a\u000aThanks for the suggestion, Paolo.

VI am generally not a food truck person because I don't like standing in a long line to order food that you then have to balance on your lap or eat in your car.  There was a bit of a change yesterday when I tried the Sausagefest truck at the Ugly Sweater run in downtown Las Vegas.  There was no line and I could bring my sandwich back to an area where there were some seats and be comfortable eating.\u000a\u000aI walked over to the truck after fellow Yelper Edwin P. walked over.  I was looking at the menu boards when the gentleman said they had a breakfast burrito.  I looked at the filling and decided that would be it.  He gave me a choice of chorizo, bacon, or half bacon - half chorizo.  I went with the 1/2 and 1/2 option.\u000a\u000aIn a short time, my burrito was handed to me.  It was quite large and it was very hot!  The burrito was filled with scrambled eggs, potatoes, onions, cheese, peppers and both chorizo and bacon.  I had asked for it spicy and the sauce they used was spicy although I could have walked back and gotten some Sriracha.\u000a\u000aThe sandwich was very tasty and very filling.  I will look for the truck at CES where he'll be out front.  It will give me a chance to try something different.

VThe highlight for me was the bread basket.  Good cheese lavash, a multi-grain bread with cherry and bacon bits, and sliced baguette.  The cherry bacon bread was outstanding!\u000a\u000aI ordered the Vadouvan Squash--squash, root vegetables in a rich curry with couscous.  It was good, but I would have liked a bit more curry flavor to the dish.  \u000a\u000aAfter dinner, the server brought us a complimentary plate of miniature macarons.  It was a tasty ending to the meal.\u000a\u000aService was good.  My iced tea was replaced with a fresh one when I got low on the first one.  Water glasses were refilled.  Our server was super about 5 people paying with cash and credit cards.  \u000a\u000aThe room was very loud when we first arrived at 7:30, but quieted down as some of the diners left.  I like the film reels on the ceiling in going with their Barrymore theme.  I think the place is a bit overrated.  I don't think I'd make a return visit.  The prices don't justify what you get.

VWe stopped in to try this restaurant after driving by several times and reading some Yelp reviews.  I also had a Groupon I wanted to use.\u000a\u000aWe ordered Chinese style egg rolls.  They were quite good, served very hot such that we had to let them sit for quite awhile to prevent mouth burn.\u000a\u000aFor main courses, my wife ordered their garlic stir fry with chicken.  It was just the way she likes it, lots of garlic and a good amount of chicken with some vegetables.  I ordered the soft shell crab in garlic curry sauce.  They didn't ask me about a spiciness level and I didn't specify one.  It was a mild curry, but it was very good.  The crab was on top of asparagus and some yellow squash and zucchini.  The presentation of both dishes was very good.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I tried the custard-Thai style.  It's more like a piece of bread pudding.  It was very flavorful and quite enjoyable.  My wife got some green tea ice cream.\u000a\u000aWe enjoyed our meal a lot!  The place is small--the sign says Maximum Occupancy 49.  Our server was very efficient.  There was a small language barrier but we overcame that with numbers and by pointing.\u000a\u000aAfter the meal, he asked two things--how was the food?  Did we think it was priced fairly?  It's as if they are trying to find pricing that gets business but doesn't break their bank.  I did find the question quite odd.\u000a\u000aWe will be back.  I have to try some of the Vietnamese dishes.  And when my wife asks, "Are you going to write about this restaurant on the computer?" (Is the pope Catholic?), you know she enjoyed her meal a lot!

VThis is hands down one of the best shows I've seen in Las Vegas.  Elton John is at his best.  The show is so much better than his Red Piano show which was at Caesars several years ago and it was a super show!\u000a\u000aThis time, he has chosen to make full use of the Colosseum's marvelous LED screen  The panel is 120 feet by 40 feet--the largest in North America-- and it's able to show almost any graphic imaginable. \u000a\u000aThe piano is a Yamaha Grand that took four years to build and contains 68 LED video screens.  During the show, the projections on the Colosseum screen are matched by identical images on the piano.  It is amazing.\u000a\u000aSir Elton is more personal during this show.  He doesn't talk at length, but when he does, it adds greatly to the show.  I was interested in how he and longtime lyricist Bernie Taupin produced the music they did over their many years of collaboration.\u000a\u000aAlthough the set list is great from beginning to end, there were three pieces that really got to me--"Your Song", "Empty Garden (Hey Hey Johnny)", and "Indian Sunset."  I have loved "Indian Sunset" from first hearing and I was glad he added it to this show.\u000a\u000aHe's backed by a great band and some fine singers.  In short, the show has everything!\u000a\u000aThe show runs about 2 hours and it's a concert you won't forget.

VThis review is for their showroom only.\u000a\u000aI came here to see the Dirty Joke Show which I always seemed to miss when it was at Hooters or later when Geechy Guy went to the Rio.  It's a really "intimate" showroom.  To understand that joke, you have to attend the Dirty Joke Show.\u000a\u000aThere were three comics who did their comedy from this small stage with has some funny, alley props.  There's also a door going off the stage that'a a prop that I was watching to see if it fell over.\u000a\u000aBeverage service was very good in the showroom.  All seating is with high top bar stools.

VI got my chance to try Le Thai when I was downtown last night.  I had read the Yelp reviews that gave this place a great rating, and I had to give it a go.\u000a\u000aI got the Tom Kha soup with chicken - spicy level 3.  The soup was fantastic.  The 3 was the correct spiciness.  I could have gone with 4 as it turned out, but it might have been to overwhelming.  The stock was wonderful.  The seasonings were right on, and the top had a good number of mushrooms slices floating on it.  I think it needed some more chicken, but for the price, it was quite good the way it was.\u000a\u000aAs others have noted, this is a very small place. About ten tables in a small area with two side seating bars each holding 5 people.  It's a pleasant space with nice wicker chairs.\u000a\u000aService was quick and pleasant.  This is certainly worth a re-visit to try one of the noodle dishes.

VThe people on Yelp come through again.  I saw a review for this diner many months ago, bookmarked it, but never went.  The other day before running some errands, I stopped here to have breakfast.\u000a\u000aThey have a 3 item (your choice) omelette option and I went with that.  I got mushrooms, spinach, and pepper jack cheese.  The omelette came with hash browns and toast.  I opted for rye toast and it was the swirl rye.  The omelette had a large amount of the three items.  Coffee was brought before I ordered an refilled several times.\u000a\u000aA few things about the place.  It's small and quaint with Coca Cola memorabilia.  The menu says breakfast is served to 10:30.  I arrived close to 10:30 and the server, Brenda, told me they could stretch the time a bit and that they will make an omelette any time of the day.  The menu is limited.  Don't expect to get stuffed French toast or exotic flavored pancakes.  This is a basic diner with basic diner food well prepared.  The neon sign inside says 50s Diner and I think they go by just The Diner at LVM because of the other 50s diner in town.  Parking is ample in front and the grounds fo the LVM are really nice--at least what you can see from the entrance.\u000a\u000aI had a pleasant time sitting at the counter and watching the cook do his thing and just taking in the behind the scenes activities.  Brenda was a fine server and very pleasant woman.\u000a\u000aHad it not been for Yelp, I would never have known that there was an LVM Resort or a diner open to the public there.

VThis is a strenuous hike with a lot of elevation gain to a false summit, then elevation loss, and then elevation gain to the true summit.  This is not a hike for the casual person, and it's almost a must that you wear hiking boots.  Especially coming back down, the steepness and the slippery sand and gravel can make slipping a very easy thing.\u000a\u000aThe payoff for all this hard work is the view.  The view of Las Vegas and the Spring Mountains to the west.  The view of Lake Mead, Rainbow Gardens, and Lava Butte to the east.  Any direction you look will be wonderful and you feel like you're on top of the world.\u000a\u000aThis is a cool weather hike.  You certainly don't want to be doing it in July when it's in the 100s.\u000a\u000aI was conflicted about whether this should be a 4 or 5 star rating and I finally decided on the 5 stars.  The view makes this hike "as good as it gets" in spite of the work to reach the goal.\u000a\u000aI have added some of the photos I took when I did this hike on February 18, 2008 to give you an idea of how steep the two road sections are.

VI have been to the showroom at the Orleans Hotel and Casino probably 15 times.  This 850 seat venue has theatre style seating as opposed to the classic Las Vegas showroom consisting of booths and tables.\u000a\u000aThe staff at the theatre are always very helpful.  Sight lines from anywhere are good although I prefer the three center sections BB, CC, or DD rather than stage right AA or stage left EE.\u000a\u000aThere are cup holders attached to the seats in front of you, but it can be a bit of a reach as the legroom in the aisles in excellent.\u000a\u000aThe showroom tends to have entertainment that appeals to the older crowd such as tonight which was a 90 minute show by the show business legend Mitzi Gaynor who at 80 years of age put on a great show.\u000a\u000aThe lighting is well done, and I have never been here when there wasn't anything but the best sound levels with no microphone problems.

VLet me join the list of 5 star reviewers for Dreikosen.  When I left for the gym this morning, the garage door made a different sound when it got to the bottom.  When I came back home, I realized why.  It just didn't shut, it banged shut because of a broken spring and one cable that snapped, too!\u000a\u000aI was going to wait until my neighbors were up before calling to see who they had do their door when it happened to them earlier this year and then I realized--Yelp--why wait to call anyone.  I look on Yelp for garage repair services and up came a bunch of different companies but only one had many entries with mostly 5 stars.  \u000a\u000aI called and Jeff answered the phone promptly.  I explained about the cable (at that time I hadn't noticed the spring) and he said he'd have someone here by 11 AM.  (I told Jeff how I found his company and he was appreciative of Yelp).  At about 10:20, I got a call from Travis who said he was on his way.  He arrived just before 11, went to the garage with me, and quickly diagnosed the problems.\u000a\u000aWithin a very reasonable time frame, the spring was replaced with double springs which is what the door should have had in the first place, two new cables were installed on each side, and the cheap plastic wheels were replaced with rollers with ball bearings.  The price was excellent for the work that needed to be done.\u000a\u000aTravis was polite, pleasant, and very professional.  He knows his stuff.  The garage door is so much more quiet now than it's been in the 11 years I've lived here.  \u000a\u000aIf you need garage door repair, you need to call Jeff at Dreikosen.  It's a local firm and they are very, very good and deserving of the 5 star rating!

VThis was my second visit to Fogo.  The first was for an evening Yelp Eiite Event and this visit was for lunch with the Las Vegas Restaurant Week Fall 2012 pricing.  For a few dollars more than the normal lunch price, you get  a choice of 3 desserts and a contribution is made to Three Square.\u000a\u000aThe salad bar has fewer items at lunch than dinner, but they have the most common items you'd want including hearts of palm, some excellent sliced cheese (one of my favorites), chilled asparagus, and other items besides greens for salad.\u000a\u000aThe servers come around with their skewers of meat.  Yesterday's hit for me was the garlic steak.  What great garlic flavor!  I also enjoyed some lamb chops, boneless chicken breast wrapped with bacon and pichana to name a few. In addition, you have some of the cheese puffs to start out and you get sides of mashed potato, fried and glazed plantain, and polenta sticks.  For dessert, I chose the turtle cheesecake which was very good.\u000a\u000aThis is a very solid, well priced coma-inducing lunch.  You want to come home and sleep for an hour or so just as you did after your mother's holiday dinners when you fell asleep during the football game.  I like this place!

VI had a failure of the hard drive on my several year old DVR this morning.  After troubleshooting the problem, I was told by the telephone rep to return the HD box with DVR to this office and they'd replace it.\u000a\u000aI was in and out in under 15 minutes.  You sign in on a touch screen and are called when it's your turn.  Uriel waited on me.  He made sure I got the DVR with newer controls and he provided me with a new remote which is an upgraded version of the old one.\u000a\u000aIt was a pleasant surprise to be in and out of here so quickly with such good customer service.  I am a fan!

VWe stopped for breakfast this morning after my wife's blood work.  She was dying for her first coffee of the day, and that was the first thing we got.  Rich and tasty.\u000a\u000aFor our breakfasts, I had the lemon ricotta pancakes with sautéed apples.  The pancakes very light and they had just enough of lemon flavor with the ricotta so as not to be too lemony.  I used some syrup.  I think if I have this again, I might get the cream cheese icing they use with the red velvet pancakes.  it would be a nice combination.\u000a\u000aMy wife had a spinach omelette with cheddar cheese.  They offer hash browns or fruit and she got the fruit.  A very nice cup of fresh fruit.  They also give you a choice of toast or bagel.  Having a bagel instead of toast is not a common choice.  She opted for wheat toast.\u000a\u000aWe enjoyed everything very much.  Norm brought the orders to the table and chatted with us for awhile.  He asked for any suggestions, comments, or complaints.  They have instituted a comment card that's brought with your check.  It's optional, but if you fill it out, they stamp it for a discounted car wash at Fabulous Freddy's - $3 off.\u000a\u000aService was the best.  There weren't many people there, but they were very attentive.  I enjoyed my stop here, and I'll be back.

VI am so pleased to have this new bicycle shop in my neighborhood.  I took my bike here yesterday to find out the reason for multiple flats with the front tire.  The young man at the store replaced the wheel liner to protect the tube from the spots where the spokes connect to the wheel.  Then he showed me the under side of the tube.  A hole was there from where the connection rubbed the tube and caused yet another flat.\u000a\u000aThe price was less than other shops charge for less work and it was done on the spot.  Having this shop in the neighborhood means I can ride my bike there and walk home when I take it in for a tuneup.  When ready, I can walk back and then ride the bike path back home.\u000a\u000aI certainly am glad I went here yesterday instead of returning to my previous bike store.  This was much better!

VI went two places yesterday to enjoy being away from the city in a different way than hiking.  My first stop was here at the Henderson Bird Viewing Preserve.  I have friends from New Jersey who have been here twice on vacations to Las Vegas and they always said what a great place it was and they were right.\u000a\u000aYou enter the preserve through an office where you fill out a short form for contact information and save harmless for the City of Henderson.  This is good for two years.  You sign the guest book and then enter the preserve going out the back door.  There are volunteers working here who make sure you have a map and a bird pamphlet so you can mark off the birds you see if you want.  \u000a\u000aFrom the back door, you're on your own to explore and enjoy!  There's a dirt track that goes basically two miles around the exterior perimeter.  You can see many of the pools this way.  There is also a dry pond in one spot where burrowing owls have been spotted.\u000a\u000aThere are two places where the preserve has observation points.  One is a boardwalk that goes out into one of the ponds where you can get closer to view some of the birds.  There are benches at the end of this walk and there are benches in many places throughout the preserve to just relax and enjoy the solitude and sounds of the birds.\u000a\u000aThere are a couple of blinds with holes at different levels for different height people to stand behind to observe the birds.  You can also get some good photos without scaring the birds.  Finally, there's a raised platform--you walk up a set of steps--that looks out over two of the ponds.  It's a great place to stop and watch what flies by.\u000a\u000aI will be back.  This is one of those places where going just once is not enough!!

VI have to give the Mob Bar four stars even thought they serve the cola that begins with the letter P.  The bartender, Pinto, was a friendly chap and he empathized with my dilemma.  Do I stick with water or go with a diet from that inferior cola company.\u000a\u000aIn the end, I got the diet cola.  The price was right and service was excellent!\u000a\u000aThis was a good place to have our Yelp Book Club meeting and I was glad to try a new place.

VHolly's review is right on!  This was my second year doing this event.  Last year, I did the bicycle ride.  That was such a cluster, it wasn't offered this year.\u000a\u000aI don't run, but I walk the 5K.  I always have my beard with me so that's never a problem.  I also park in the north lot and make a quick exit on Sunset.\u000a\u000aI really dislike the growth in the numbers of dogs that are here every year.  At least they had the good sense to crap at home before they came here, because I saw no doggy do anywhere.\u000a\u000aIt's fun doing the walk because the entertainment beforehand--Jabbawockeez from the Monte Carlo, some dancers from the topless show Fantasy at the Luxor, and five flying Santas that parachuted to the parking lot from a helicopter high above the boulevard, and others--make this a fun event. Also, the chance to walk over the freeway on Sunset, something you don't do everyday is worth the walking.\u000a\u000aIt's also the main fundraiser for Opportunity Village, a very needy charity in Southern nevada.  I'll be back next year for another go, suit and all!

VI think I'm the last of my Yelp friends to try Dom DeMarco's.  Even the president ate some before I did!  Yesterday on the way home from a play at UNLV, I had this place in mind for quick take out before going to the evening play for which we had tickets.\u000a\u000aI had looked at the menu online and had already decided I'd get a square (thick crust) white pizza with some toppings I chose.  They've changed their menus and I ask the greeter if I could still get the white pizza.  She told me too different kinds I could get and I opted for the white truffle with mushrooms.\u000a\u000aI agree with Nelson Q. that there was so much garlic that it hid the truffle flavor.  The pizza was very good nonetheless.  There was a lot of garlic and there were many mushrooms.  My only negative comment would be that some areas of the pizza were baked to a black crust rather than an evenly done one.\u000a\u000aService was pretty good.  I waited about 15 minutes for it to be ready.  The greeter asked me if I'd like some water while I was waiting--a nice touch.\u000a\u000aI almost wished that my wife was with me so we could have stayed there and eaten in their patio area with just enough shrubs and trees to make Hualapai Commons and the cars almost disappear.  Instead, I got my hands greasy and salty at the kitchen table. \u000a\u000aI also long for the menu at pizza places where you have the blank canvas and get your white pizza with toppings x, y, and z.  You can still do that some places but it seems to be a disappearing thing at the more upscale places.

VI came here to see an afternoon show yesterday.  The room is fairly small, but it's a nice little venue for a show.\u000a\u000aThere's a bar as you enter.  Seating was in a semi-circle facing the stage.  The back of the stage had lights that changed color as the director of this show wanted.\u000a\u000aIf I saw there was another show here, I wouldn't hesitate to come see it if the show appealed to my taste.

VI stopped in here today to give the place a test drive.  I got the Chicken Caesar wrap and a diet Coke--none of those health drinks for me.\u000a\u000aThe wrap was good.  The only criticism I have is putting essentially Caesar salad in a wrap including the croutons.  If I come back and get this, I'd definitely ask for the croutons to be omitted.\u000a\u000aSandwiches, wraps, and burgers come with a choice of sweet potato fries, fruit, or mixed green salad.  I took the healthy choice by getting the sweet potato fries.\u000a\u000aThe wrap is a bit pricey--$9.50.  I don't think the value is there for this amount of food.  Maybe I paid extra for all the health I got.

VI stopped here today to get a salad and a shake.  They have a setup for the drive through I've never seen before.  Because of the limited driveway space, the entrance splits into two drives, both of which have ordering areas.  This allows the cars to get into the drive through section quicker and not block traffic in the shopping center.\u000a\u000aService was fast and polite, and the wait for the food was minimal.  They have free wifi at this location and I saw a sign about two nights of jazz by a live singer in their McCafé on two nights in December.  I wish I could make one of the nights just to try it out.  Sounds like fun!\u000a\u000aSince this is a new McDonald's that opened within the past few months and it's only about 2 miles from home, I'll be stopping at this location more often.  Way to go, McDonald's staff!

VI missed the Yelp event here after Moreno opened and I wanted to go see the show.  After seeing the show last night, it's easy to give him 5 stars.  Moreno is an excellent performer, a man skilled in putting on a good show and highlighting his many talents.  He also has a band backing him up that's simply superb!  Nine member sin the band and they blow the roof off the room.\u000a\u000aMuch of Moreno's music is unknown to me because it's music he and his brothers have written.  The show varies from rock to ballad, to Jerry Lee Lewis-like banging the keys on the piano.  If Moreno wasn't so talented, I'd say he was showing off, but he simply is an excellent piano player.  In addition, in one number he has a bit of a drum duet with his drummer.  In a couple of songs he plays guitar.  He sings very well, a strong voice with excellent enunciation!  \u000a\u000aThis is a show I'll recommend to friends from out of town.  I think it's the only show like it on the Las Vegas Strip.  Very enjoyable!

VYesterday, I was in need of a quick dinner.  The answer was to try one of the new Firehouse Subs that have been opened recently.  \u000a\u000aI looked at the menu online so I had some idea of what I would order.  I got a small tuna and a small engineer.  I saw the magic Coke machine but since I was taking the subs home, I didn't try it out.  Also, I had Holly C.'s admonition about the flavored syrups, so that factored into my decision.\u000a\u000aMy wife and I both enjoyed our subs.  They were very tasty and the price is good.  I'll be returning and try something else, and yes, I will hit up that Coke machine.  No one was using it when I was there yesterday.

VA friend from Canada emailed and wanted to know if we could meet somewhere for breakfast.  She had some shopping she wanted to do today and asked what places I'd suggest.  I sent her a few Yelp links and she picked BabyStacks Café.  I have smart friends!\u000a\u000aWe met just before 8 this morning.  I have eaten at the other location where I had the red velvet pancakes.  I had studied the menu several times before going and changed my mind as I was ordering.  I got a short stack of the Rocky Road pancakes.  The menu describes it this way:  "Almonds and marshmallow in chocolate batter, topped with fresh whipped cream, more almonds and marshmallows.  Lightly drizzled with chocolate syrup and cocoa powder."\u000a\u000aHow's that for having dessert for breakfast?  The cakes were excellent!  Very flavorful with lots of good chocolate flavor and the sliced almonds added some nice texture.  Our coffee was refilled quickly.\u000a\u000aThis was a great place to meet a good friend, have some good conversation, and enjoy some tasty pancakes for breakfast.  There are so many other things on the menu you try, that I'll have to return!

VI was thinking of giving KJ 3.5 stars, but I rounded it to 4 because of the great company with whom I had brunch here on Saturday.\u000a\u000aThe carts came around often with good selections.  I am happy I got to go again for dim sum with a Chinese speaking friend.  There's no language barrier and they often know what to order or what to avoid.  Such was the case Saturday with Li Ly, our friend who is moving back to San Francisco and the reason 7 of us got together for brunch.\u000a\u000aWe had shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings, sesame balls, sweet buns, and some good shrimp balls.  I don't know the Chinese names for any of these, but they were generally good.  \u000a\u000aWe had fairly good service although Li Ly had to dig her heels in and get the service we needed.\u000a\u000aI like the room.  It's well appointed and the decor is bright and roomy.

VI had not heard of this independent coffee house until our Yelp Book Club decided to have their discussion there.  This is a super place!\u000a\u000aI ordered the Caribbean Colada smoothie.  The gentleman at the register told me it had everything but the rum.  On a 113 degree day in Las Vegas, this was just the ticket for a refreshing, evening drink while discussing our book.  The coconut and pineapple flavors were excellent!  It was an outstanding drink!!\u000a\u000aThe room has many tables for laptop use and there is free wifi.  The music was playing at a volume which was enough to hear it and enjoy it without it intruding on speaking with my group.  \u000a\u000aI have checked Grouchy John's website and their mobile unit will be near where I live this Friday.  Great!  I can patronize them without the drive.\u000a\u000aSee you Friday, Grouchy!

VTwice in 5 days--not bad.  When I was at the store Monday night for the Yelp event, Grouchy John told me he'd be at the Nevada Cancer Institute with his mobile unit today.  That's only about a mile from home.\u000a\u000aAfter the gym, I skipped my regular coffee stop and went to the NCI.  There was John in the curve of the one building with the unit.  I got an iced quad espresso and two pastries--a cheese danish and a blueberry muffin.\u000a\u000aThe coffee and the cheese danish were great.  I'll keep checking the website to see when the unit will be in my area again.  It was good to see John again--with a smile and not grouchy!

VI was to the Mob Museum for a Yelp Event two years ago and I was back yesterday for a talk and book signing.  I still have not taken the time to see all of the exhibits. \u000a\u000aYesterday, there was a talk by Dr. David Schwartz of UNLV about his new book "Grandissimo, the First Emperor of Las Vegas."  Dr. Schwartz has written about Jay Sarno who built both Caesars Palace and Circus Circus.\u000a\u000aThe setting for the talk was the historic courtroom on the second floor where on of the Kefauver Committee hearings into organized crime was held.  What a treat to hear about some different history in this historic setting.\u000a\u000aI will go back and enjoy all of the exhibits.  It's grand this building was preserved and is now used for the Mob Museum or more technically the National Museum of Organized Crime & Law Enforcement.  We are fortunate to have this museum in Las Vegas.

VWow!  What a disappointment!  I grew up watching the fantastic cartoons created by Chuck Jones and I was so pleased to read about the Chuck Jones Experience coming to Circus Circus.  I purchased a Groupon and waited for the right day to use it to revel in all that is Chuck Jones.  The trouble is, there's not a lot to revel in.\u000a\u000aI thought the most interesting part of the exhibit was the video playing as you enter.  It was very interesting looking at the Type A personality of Jones as he drew many of the characters in the poses he wanted them in and then saw some of them come to life.  Interviewing people who worked with Jones was interesting too.  It was a way of learning how the background artist did his job and the parameters he had to observe that Jones set.  After about 15 minutes of watching the video, the benches start to get really hard and you have the need to get up and walk around.\u000a\u000aIt's a small area with many frames of cartoons that Jones drew.  I felt the descriptions of things could have been better done.  Many of the plates were small with 10 point or so lettering and they were not at all helpful at times.\u000a\u000aI did like the optical illusion of Jones.  When I first glanced that way, I saw his image.  As I got closer, I lost it in my mind's eye.  Then I saw the sign on the wall to look through your camera and there it was again!\u000a\u000aI understand now why they issued a Groupon, to draw traffic through the exhibit, but it was a Groupon I could have easily passed up had I known.  The best way to honor Jones and enjoy his work is to watch some of his actual work.

VI went here with a group of Yelpers on a taco trot UYE arranged by Nelson and Sylvia Q.  This was the first stop on our quest to try tacos at three different places.  Nelson had advised that the al pastor tacos were the best he's had and who was I to disagree when he has so much experience.\u000a\u000aI ordered two tacos--remember, we had two more spots to go and then on for a dessert stop.  The two tacos were al pastor and cabeza.  The al pastor is pork meat, seasoned, piled onto a large carousel skewer, and then cooked as it turns.  I ordered the taco with complimentary pineapple at nelson's suggestion.  The pineapple is cubed and spread over the pork pieces.  It makes a great taste combination! \u000a\u000aThe cabeza is shredded beef head.  When you get your tacos, there's a separate area on the side where there are all kinds of toppings--pico, cilantro, sauces of differing spiciness, diced onion, and limes.  With this, I ordered some guava juice.\u000a\u000aThe two tacos were outstanding!  We stood around in the small area eating our delights and having good conversation and lots of laughs.  This is a must do again!  What a great place with such pleasant people working here.  At $2 per taco and $1 per drink, it's a very good deal.  Round 1 of our taco trek was complete!

VVillage Square was a nice shopping plaza when I first moved here about a dozen years ago.  Anchored by the Regal Village Square Theatre complex, the center had shops of all kinds from a bakery with fine teas to a low cost hair cutting place.  Over a period of time, new businesses took the place of others that closed and the center seem to lose a bit of its original luster.\u000a\u000aThen the great recession hit and the place became like a ghost town.  There were more empty stores than open ones and some of the businesses had a hard time hanging on and staying in business.\u000a\u000aIn the last year, the owners of the plaza announced that they were going to renovate the exteriors and generally make the place a more pleasant area.  New palm trees have been planted, the store fronts have a fresh coat of paint, but best of all they have changed the way you enter and park in the center.  Previously, you had to go east or west and then park in rows facing north and south.  Today when I went to get take out from Archi's Thai Café, I noticed that the parking is wonderful.  You can go right straight through and park in an east/west direction.  This makes so much better sense.\u000a\u000aThere are some new stores coming including a new Mexican restaurant.  Those holding on have been Archi's, Tropical Smoothie Café, Alligator Soup crafts store, and Cold Stone Creamery.  \u000a\u000aLet's hope with the improving economy and the facelift the owners have given Village Square, the best is yet to come!

V** 3.5 stars **\u000a\u000aI've been to Big Al's Comedy Club several times.  Like any other comedy club, how good it is depends who's booked for that week.  I've seen as bad as Kato Kaelin and I've seen some good comics.\u000a\u000aThe venue is odd because it once was a restaurant in the Orleans.  The entrance is almost directy across from the buffet entrance.  There are two rows of plush seats in the front.  These are people who are being comped or have gotten their early to try to get seats close to the front.  On the left side facing the stage, there are some booths that also have some chairs, but the largest section--the middle--is made up of longer tables with seating on both sides and that hold 8 people.\u000a\u000aThe club is open Wednesday through Sunday and there is one show at 8 PM.  Cost is $19.95 which includes tax and one drink.  \u000a\u000aLast night, I saw Kristeen Von Hagen and Danny Villalpando.  Both were funny, but with only two comics other than the MC who only does a brief stint, both featured comics seemed long.\u000a\u000aIt is an OK venue and depending on the people booked, it's a good club to attend.

VI have seen Trent Carlini several times and I like the impersonation of Elvis that he does.  This show seems a little muted compared to the shows I saw a few years back.  The changes of clothes are not as dramatic as before and they take less time.\u000a\u000aThe show is in the Shimmer Showroom at the LVH and all seats are good.  We were seated at the railing of the second section and the seats were great!  Carlini has added to his act a wonderful dancer, Ashley Belle, who is a very talented dancer.  She dances during the clothes changing breaks and and she sometimes does some modern dance accompanying Carlini.  I was really taken by her smooth moves and talent!  She's a great addition to the show.\u000a\u000aTo get me to stand up and grind the hips a bit takes some doing but Carlini got all the guys in the room--for the most part--to get up and show their stuff.  I sat down pretty quickly because no one was doing the Twist.  Do they still do it?  :)\u000a\u000aGo see Carlini.  His show is good and the showroom is terrific!

VAfter our Taco Trek on East Charleston, we made our way about a mile east and stopped at La Flor for dessert.  This small store is filled with delightful ice cream.  All their ice cream is made in house.  There are so many different flavors that you've never heard of.  \u000a\u000aNelson had told me one of his favorites was piñon--pine nut ice cream.  I got a double scoop of that in a cup.  Then you add your toppings at no extra charge and your own sundae is created.  I chose some chocolate sauce which hardens like a shell with some candy sprinkles on top.\u000a\u000aI sat and ate enjoying every bite.  Again, we slammed the place.  Because it's so small, there was hardly room to walk around.  I finished my ice cream outside.  When our group was done and the people who had come while we jammed the place had been served, I went back in to look at the flavors more carefully.  They will give you a sample of any flavor you want.  Next time, I'm getting the red cactus ice cream.  It looked and sounded great the way the woman explained.  No need to wait for 100 degree days.  I'll be back pronto!

VLast night was the third time I've made it to La Flor de Michoacan for some of their homemade ice cream.  I got two scoops in a cup, piñon (pine nut which is one of my favorites there) and a scoop of elote, ice cream made from corn.  She asked me what toppings I wanted, and I got a few spoons of coconut.\u000a\u000aThen it was outside time to sit on one of their benches and enjoy.  For a warm evening I was surprised I was the only customer for awhile.  This place is good.  Why can;t you be on the other side of town.  At least it's not too far from the freeway!

VThe show is a mixture of various magic acts and comedy with magic.  The before show activity on the stage was avant garde.  With a series of fans in a circle, the air is circulated such that two large pieces of silk like cloths float up and down on the currents.  Whoever thought this up was quite creative.  It is mesmerizing and difficult not to watch them as they float.\u000a\u000aTonight, the show consisted of four main acts interspersed with comedy and magic from the MC, Michael Finney.   Finney was a little lethargic at the beginning of the show and the audience didn't warm up to him.  \u000a\u000aHe quickly introduced Ed Alonzo, a comic magician who is billed as "The Misfit of Magic."  Alonzo was quite funny and was a treat.  The brick part was indeed very funny!\u000a\u000aSecond came Juliana Chen.  She had a different beginning to her set, but it became tedious after awhile when she kept making more and more playing cards appear.  I was sitting in the front row on the side and I figured out how she was doing her trick.  It did grow old quickly.\u000a\u000aThird segment was the shadow figures by Sonny Fontana made with his hands and with the help of an assistant.  Some are very clever when he imitates famous people.  At the start, however, the animal he was making was shown on a video display.  If you have to show us what you're making, you're not confident of how well we'll know what you're making.\u000a\u000aThe last segment was magician Kevin James who was on Season 2 of America's Got Talent.  I saw AGT probably three times in the years it's been on and I saw one of the nights when he performed.  This is a very entertaining and funny segment of the show.  James is very good.  Given my seating, I did see something that helped explain one part to me.\u000a\u000aIn between the acts, Finney did some magic and card tricks with audience members.  He was OK but there was nothing that was new here.  I simply was to give the crew time to ready the stage for the next segment.\u000a\u000aSummary:  The show is new and it needs to pick up the pace a bit.  Chen needs to vary her routine more.  The stars are Alonzo and James.  The show started with a bang and ended the same way.  It is misnamed because there's no cutting edge, avant garde routines with the show, but it's worth seeing.  Get discounted tickets at Tix4Tonite or something like that.

VI got a dinner/show package for Gordon Ramsay Steak and Jersey Boys at a discounted locals' price.  Last night was the night and both were excellent!  I am one of those people who dislikes the public persona of Gordon Ramsay.  I'm not sure I would have come here last night but it was one of the food options and I grabbed for the ring and I got the gold one.\u000a\u000aI had a few choices from their menu for each course but it was easy for me to order.  For an appetizer, the British ale onion soup.  For the main course, I chose the 24 ounce bone in rib eye.  And for dessert I ordered the sticky toffee pudding.  I did not order a side, an extra charge, since I would be eating approximately a pound of beef alone.  \u000a\u000aI had a reservation for 5 PM and arrived shortly before.  A hostess asked me to wait in the lounge area and assured me I'd be shown to my table soon and I was.  Another hostess asked me if I wanted to walk the stairs or take the elevator.  The stairs it was.  She seated me at a small table along the railing which gave me a nice view of the downstairs dining area and a  view of the ceiling with the Union Jack and the neon sculpture.  Coming up the stairs, she explained that the neon was an artist's conception of the movement Ramsay's hands make when he's creating a beef Wellington.  It is very interesting very different.\u000a\u000aRichard, one of my servers, brought me their drink iPad.  I politely passed and went with an iced tea.  They only serve bottled iced tea, Republic of Tea, and I was given a choice of three flavors.  The blackberry sage was my choice, a tea I often make at home.  \u000a\u000aI gave Richard my voucher for dinner and a few moments later, he brought the Ramsay menu and told me my choices for each of the courses.  I ordered the soup and steak first and waited until later to order dessert.\u000a\u000aSome bread was brought to my table and the selection was so different than normal.  There were two lemon thyme focaccia squares, one mushroom truffle mini brioche, a pancetta fig mini brioche, and two slices of Stilton walnut baguette.  On the side of the bread plate was a round of English Devonshire butter with Hawaiian volcanic sea salt sprinkled on top.  Yes!  A restaurant that doesn't hide the salt from you.  I did observe a woman at the next table trying to get some butter without getting a single salt crystal so I understand both sides.  The bread was excellent.  I had one slice of the baguette and one mini brioche--the mushroom truffle.  I knew there was a large steak coming and I wanted to leave room.\u000a\u000aThe onion soup was excellent.  I had some of that soup at Ramsay's Pub at Caesars so I knew what to expect.  Rich broth, tasty caramelized onions, and the two slices of Welsh rarebit on top made for a very good start.\u000a\u000aThen a runner brought my steak and it was indeed huge!  It had a Demi-glace with mustard seeds.  The steak was done extra rare as I requested.  It was marbled very nicely and it was very tender.  I sat their thinking I must be some kind of glutton as I kept eating and eating until I was almost completely to the bone.  At home, I would have gnawed on it like a dog, but I let my better manners take over last night.  After bringing me the steak, Carlos, my other server, asked if I wanted any salt or pepper.  He appeared a but later with a plate with two containers--one with ground pepper and the other with sea salt!  A second Yes!\u000a\u000aLater, I ordered the sticky toffee pudding.  I also had this at Caesars. I wanted to compare it to some STP I had the week before at another steakhouse on the Strip.  There is no comparison.  Ramsay's version wins hands down.  It's a moist pudding cake served with toffee in a metal pourer and a stick of brown butter ice cream.  Delicious!\u000a\u000aA note on service.  Richard and Carlos were first rate!  They were polite and friendly.  An above and beyond kind of thing happened when I asked Carlos about the types of bread.  He went to the kitchen, got a sheet of paper, and wrote out what they served.  That was really nice of him and it helped me remember the different things on the plate.  At the end of dinner, Richard gave me a business card with their two names on it and I'll keep it for the future because I will be back.  I have to try some more things on the menu.\u000a\u000aBy the way, Mr. Ramsay, I may change my thoughts about you a bit.  I understand that you're public persona is somewhat of a show for TV and that you're much different--read nicer--when not before the cameras in Hell's Kitchen!

VI was unable to attend the Elite Event held here last year, but I got an offer for a free round of golf at KISS.  I decided to use it.  After all, I hadn't played miniature golf in many years and although I'm not a KISS fan, it seemed like it would be fun.  It was!!!!\u000a\u000aFrom the moment I went in throughout the time I was there, I was treated beautifully by the great staff.  I didn't know any of the songs being cranked out by the KISS FM radio station that broadcasts live from the golf course, but I enjoyed the music given the surroundings.\u000a\u000aThere are plenty of black lights and the walls are painted with phosphorescent pictures of Las Vegas history--the Rat Pack, Elvis, Jerry Lewis.  The holes also have KISS related things like the high heeled boot(?) and KISS heads going up and down from boxes.  White shirts and shoe laces look clean they're so bright from the black light!  The holes are pretty easy and it is fun.\u000a\u000aSince I was alone, the guy giving out the clubs and golf balls asked me if I was going to keep score.  I answered that no I was just going to have fun.  Since there were two groups of four in front of me, he took me to hole 6 and started me there so I wouldn't be bunched up behind the two groups. He also cautioned me not to play #18 until I had gone to play 1 through 5.  When your ball goes in Simmons' mouth, you don't get it back.\u000a\u000aI really enjoyed the time I was here and I have to give kudos to a great staff!  They're very kind and they're very helpful to their guests.  Who would think I'd ride my bike at Lake Mead and play KISS mini golf a few hours later?\u000a\u000aPS:  One historical figure I got a kick out of was Ben Siegel, a.k.a. Bugsy Siegel.  On his table is a list that has the heading IDEA #342:\u000a\u000aBuild big place in desert.\u000a\u000aName it after a pink bird.\u000a\u000aAdd gambling, booze, and sexy girls.\u000a\u000aThen get rich.

VThis review is for the casino only:\u000a\u000aI was at the D last night ti see a show - Adam London - who is filling in for Kevin Burke while he's away.\u000a\u000aI was pleased to see the Longbar that I've read about online.  There was a vibe and energy to the casino as I walked through.  They have added dancers and I stopped to take in the show.  One of the blackjack dealers was moving pretty nicely, but I think she kept business away from her table.  Who'd want to sit down and stop the entertainment?\u000a\u000aWhile I like the D, I still think it has one of the worst parking garages in downtown Las Vegas.  God, it's awful!

VAfter hiking, some of our group decided to meet up with other Yelpers who were having lunch at I-Naba.  What a great place!  \u000a\u000aI asked a friend what he'd recommend and he pointed me to something he had on his first visit - battera which is 4 pieces of mackerel served on sushi rice and a bowl of udon or soba served hot or cold.  It's also served with your choice of noodles in the broth or on the side.  I got the cold udon noodles in broth.  Everything was fantastic.  I really liked the barley iced tea they served and I must have finished one of their pitchers myself.\u000a\u000aI have to mention the service.  The young women were very helpful and polite.  They were also so good to put our cupcakes in their cooler so they didn't melt in the 100+ degree heat outside.  \u000a\u000aThe music playing was surprisingly Western (some Beatles tunes) but very enjoyable.  The company of 6 other Yelpers made this lunch a special after hike treat!  I'll be back for the soba next time.  Nothing like cold noodles during our warm dessert months.

VI have really mixed feelings about Sugar Bee's.  The macarons were absolutely not A-OK.  They were very crumbly and could hardly be picked up without crumbling.  I also found them chewy rather than soft and melt in your mouth flavor that I'm used to.  There are several bakeries that have more flavor options and better macaron product.\u000a\u000aThe garlic knots I got were good but there's nothing special about them.\u000a\u000aThe cinnamon vanilla bread pudding was quite good.  On the other hand, the carrot cake was a lot of icing with little cake.  It was OK because the icing was not really sweet but rather had the very good flavor of cream cheese icing.\u000a\u000aI was also surprised by the lack of product.  Many bakeries I go to have much more choice than was available here at about 1 PM which I don't consider that late.\u000a\u000aIf partial stars were allowed this would be a 2.5 star place.  I rounded to three.  The bakery is not in my neighborhood so I'll be missing nothing by going elsewhere.

VI have seen Rod Stewart 3 times, once at the MGM Grand Garden and now twice at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace.  The show is fantastic and the venue is too!\u000a\u000aWhen he was many years younger, Stewart told an interviewer from Rolling Stone Magazine that he didn't intend to become a parody of himself by singing "Do You Think I'm Sexy" when he was fifty years old.  Now the 68 year old Stewart, as of January, closes his show with just that song and there's a mention of the interview on the LCD panel above.  And, many of the women of all ages think he is.\u000a\u000aThe show, as another reviewer stated, starts promptly at 7:30.  If you come later, you'll be missing something so plan ahead.  Stewart changes his show a bit now and then by singing some of the songs from the album he released earlier in 2013.  Last night, he did one song from the new album.  But he did many of the standards--"Have I Told You Lately"; "The First Cut Is the Deepest"; "Rhythm of My Heart"; "Forever Young"; and "Hot Legs" to name a few.  The only gem I wish he'd do in the show would be "If Only."  I really love that song.\u000a\u000aStewart is a very active performer moving to all areas of the large stage and through the audience as he's backed up by a superb group of musicians and fine singers.  He takes full advantage of the band members' talents.  Periodically, he leaves the stage to change clothes--no, he's not as bad as Cher with clothes--but it gives the singers and band members a chance to showcase their individual and collective talents!  It also gives the 68 year old a chance to take a break.\u000a\u000aHe kicks personally signed soccer balls to the audience and you're lucky if you can get one.  He keeps the chatter to a minimum unlike some performers who have to talk forever about where a song came from, who their parents are, or even to introduce them.  The one song from the new album that he sang last night was an homage to his father and even the intro to that song was just a minimum--what it needs to be to explain it.\u000a\u000aOne note to the super fans and the younger crowd in the audience.  In case you didn't know, when you buy a ticket to the show, you get the seat, too!  At no extra cost!  Free!  Really!  Would I kid you?  You paid $250 plus fees so sit in the damn seat.  And guys, swaying your asses isn't sexy--it just means you've been hitting the sauce too much in Las Vegas.  On the other hand, there were a few cuties last night that shook their stuff and they (the women) were fine!  Other than that, except for a few songs when everyone's up and swinging, sit the hell down!

VThe show is still in previews and this was only the third performance for the show that opened Saturday, March 31st.  I'm taking that into account with my review.\u000a\u000aThere is some excellent talent with the show.  Generally the singing is very well done.   Standouts were Sheriff Dodd, Miss Mona, and Jewel.  The singing and dancing by the ensemble is also good.  A standout in the dancing was that done by the Aggies when they pay their annual visit to the Chicken Ranch.\u000a\u000aThere are some problems with the show: \u000a\u000aThe showroom's stage was not designed for a Broadway musical and the scenery is very sparse--a staircase to the girls' rooms, here merely a landing--a chair, and a love seat.  At one point, there's a desk but that's the only major change in scenery during the entire show.  It would be difficult to do more than this.\u000a\u000aGiven the limitation imposed by the stage, when the crusading journalist first broadcasts, it's in front of the gold stage curtain.  Since he's supposed to be at the state capitol building, couldn't a generic capitol building been projected onto the curtain to at least make an effort at reality?\u000a\u000aThe sound was an issue tonight.  At one point, many of the wireless mics failed.  It was especially important because the governor was making his appearance and his mic didn't work.  When he launched into his song, one of the cast members gave him a hand mic which didn't work at first either.  Another issue with the  mics was that some of the cast, when they punctuated their words, there was a sound from the mics that detracted from what they said.  This is an issue which the previews should solve as the cast and crew iron out the problems.  I had some quibbles with the lighting but it was generally OK.\u000a\u000aFinally, why did the woman who works with the photo concession have to go down the steps to the front tables three or four times during the show?  Apparently she was delivering photos, but it was distracting, unnecessary, and rude to the artists on stage who are working to provide a good show for the audience.  The photos can wait until after the show.\u000a\u000aI will come back and see this show in a few weeks and I hope I'll be able to raise the rating.  I have seen some of the cast in other shows in Las Vegas and they need to have microphones that work, consistent lighting, and respect from the other workers at the showroom, i.e., photo person!

VThank you fellow Yelpers for pointing me to this gem!  I wanted something soothing on this cold day and my wife wanted Thai food.  Solution:  order take out from Panna Thai and stop here on the way to try their sundubu.\u000a\u000aI stopped in and was greeted immediately by a very friendly lady at the counter.  She asked if it was eat in or take out and then she gave me time to look at their menu.  I had almost decided before I went to get the curry flavor sundubu.  I asked the woman if their was a spiciness level to order and she asked the chef.  She then asked, "Do you want it spicy."  "Yes" was my quick reply.  She called that back to the chef.\u000a\u000aI sat for a few minutes while I waited for my takeout.  I could see them packing 5 small containers with banchan and then the chef came out with the larger container of curry sundubu.  He asked me if I liked it spicy wiht almost a 'good luck' kind of sound to his voice.\u000a\u000aWhen I got home and had my first spoon of the soft tofu with the spicy, curry flavor, I was hooked.  Wow, is it good!  The banchans were very tasty and I was surprised when I opened the container of rice and found my seafood pancake on top.  Some very nice seafood including a good amount of octopus.\u000a\u000aI am a fan and I will be back.  The locations of the two restaurants makes this a done deal for future take out meals.

VI've been to this Starbuck's several times but didn't realize no one had ever entered it on Yelp.\u000a\u000aThe staff here has always been pleasant and competent.  There's a lot of room for working inside and the patio has some tables for sitting out when the temperatures permit.  The free wifi is always welcome!\u000a\u000aWhen I'm in the area, this is where I stop.

VIt's 9 PM and it's 92 degrees out and I'm on my way home from a show.  What to do?  Well, a left turn off Spring Mountain Road and then a quick right into CJ's lot and I had solved the problem of cooling off.  I had read the Yelp reviews and I decided to give the place a try.  So many choices.\u000a\u000aI found out that all the flavors of custard are made by flavoring vanilla custard with what you choose.  I opted for black raspberry.  It turned out that was one of the flavors "on tap" last night.  I went with that.  She asked me if I wanted any toppings.  I asked if they had any fruit.  She checked the cooler and showed me a container of fresh black raspberries.  That was fine with me so she added several raspberries to finish off the delight.\u000a\u000aI sat inside although it would have been pleasant outside.  I just didn't want to spend time listening to some overly active and loud children while I enjoyed my custard.\u000a\u000aThe custard was great!  Now that I know how the gelati, concrete, and custards are made, I'll be stopping in again.  What a great place to stop when I'm coming back from a play in Chinatown.

VI have used this trail twice as the gateway for hiking.  I have hiked to the peak of Black Mountain and today I used the trail as my gateway to hike to Park's Peak, a shorter and less rigorous hike than the Black Mountain one.\u000a\u000aThe parking area could have been larger and I'm not sure if street parking is allowed.  I was second in the lot this morning, so parking was not an issue and I saw several cars parked on the street.  I looked for signs as I was leaving the area, but I saw none that were about parking.\u000a\u000aI probably would rate this trail with more than 3 stars if I used more of it than just the short distance until you get to the Sloan Canyon NCA.  Maybe I need to do more exploring in that area.

VAfter many months of going by Bachi, I decided to give it a go and I'm glad I did.  We went in late afternoon and were seated immediately--there were only two other tables occupied.  Our server was Allen and he was very good about answering questions.  He first found out we were first timers, so he was eager to help.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Black and green burger, a burger made from American wagyu with mushrooms, spinach, bacon, bleu cheese and garlic.  I thought my wife would get a plain burger with cheese but she surprised me by wanting the Kiki burger.  We also got an order of salt and pepper garlic fries.\u000a\u000aThe burgers were fantastic!  We each enjoyed what we had ordered.  The burgers were very juicy and I love the soft buns they make fresh daily.  The fires were good but I didn't taste any garlic.  They were salted nicely and they had a couple of thin jalapeño slices which was nice.\u000a\u000aIt came time for dessert and we had decided we'd have the tasting of three flavors of ice cream sandwiches.  It turned out that they had sold the last ones the night before.  I asked if the molten chocolate cake actually took 20 minutes and Allen confirmed this.  We had no place to go so we decided to order the cake and just wait.  After about 20 minutes, one of the chef's came to the table with our dessert and apologized for the way it looked, assured us it would taste a lot better than it looked, and told us it would be no charge.  Something had gone awry and the cake just didn't hold its form and it looked a bit flattened.  He was correct--it was delicious.  I still want to go back and try the triple flavors ice cream sandwiches and I need to try their salted caramel, toasted marshmallow shake.\u000a\u000aWhen we left, Andrea said to me that we should go there once a week.  I said no.  Maybe once a month or so but there are so many good places to try.  I really liked Bachi!

VThis review is for the room and not the comics.  I was there to see Murray Celebrity Magician last night.\u000a\u000aThe room has not changed all that much since it was Brad Garrett's comedy club.  Gone are the famous comedian art from the walls and instead there are movie poster mostly from Jerry Lewis movies.\u000a\u000aThe room is laid out the same with mostly four person round tables.  I still like this room as a performance center and I'm glad to see it being used by Murray and the comedians who are there for the Laugh Factory.  \u000a\u000aLet's keep our live showrooms busy in Las Vegas so we all have a lot of live performances from which to choose.

VI stopped into the Bellagio today to pass some time before going to an appointment.  While there, i stopped at JP Patisserie and had some banana gelato.  \u000a\u000aThey have added tables along the hallway, and I was able to get a seat with a view toward the pool area.  The gelato was great, as always, and I enjoyed it more with a seat good for people watching.\u000a\u000aJean Philippe, whether at the Bellagio or Aria, is a great stop to make.

VThis showroom now known as the LVH Theater, has been home to such famous entertainers as Elvis, Liberace, and many others.  The theatre is the home of some excellent visiting shows.  I went to see a one night only concert by Liza Minnelli tonight.  She was fantastic.\u000a\u000aThe theatre has been upgraded as far as lighting and sound over the years, but it has become a bit tired in the seating.  The seating needs renovating to bring it into the 21st century and not make you think you're there to see Annette Funicello or even Elvis.\u000a\u000aThe venue is large.  It seats over 1,500.  There are restrooms and a bar on the side of the theatre and drinks are allowed at your seat.\u000a\u000aI'll continue to see shows here.  I have tickets for June for Glen Campbell's stop in Las Vegas on his farewell tour.  It's seems fitting that an older entertainer like him would be performing in this venue, but it brings out the people--including me!

VI was heading east on Charleston to get to the Polish Deli.  I knew that I needed some chopped onions for what I was making from the deli. Seeing the Walmart Market, I realized I wouldn't have to go past Decatur and fight the parking lot at the Walmart Supercenter just to get the onions.\u000a\u000aA few minutes later, purchase from the deli in hand, I headed west and made a quick detour to this store where I got my one item.  I was through the self check and out the door in less than 5 minutes.\u000a\u000aI'll remember this is here when I'm in need of an item or two and am in that area.

VThis is the standard bingo hall built by the Coast Casinos before they were sold to Boyd and the South Point was sold to Michael Gaughan as a separate unit.  The hall is roomy, bright, and I found the staff to be very nice.  \u000a\u000aI came here for a UYE bingo event to celebrate Teri W's birthday.  Since it had been about 10 years since I played bingo in Las Vegas, the young folk explained to the old guy what to do.\u000a\u000aI saved our tables while some waited in line to buy their cards.  I then went and got my cards and the electronic machine.  The electronic version makes it so easy.  You don't have to do a thing except yell BINGO, and for our table, we didn't even have to do that!\u000a\u000aThe machines are quite easy to use and you really need do nothing but watch.  Everything else is automatic.  This leaves ample time for quiet (sometimes) talk and you can update your Facebook status as many times as you want.\u000a\u000aThe bingo hall at the South Point is very pleasant.  I'll be back for another go when the next UYE is planned.

VThe Spring Mountain National Recreation Area is generally regarded as the area around Kyle and Lee Canyons.  The recreation area allows many things that you wouldn't expect in the Las Vegas area.  There's skiing and snowboarding in the winter, snowshoe trips in the winter, hiking in the summer, and lots and lots of trees.  While it's still desert, the mountains get much more rain, relatively speaking, than does Las Vegas and thus the lush nature of the mountains.\u000a\u000aI visit the mountain in various times of the year but mostly in the summer for hiking.  There are many trails.  The hiking can be difficult for many because of the elevation.  There are few trails that start at less than 7,500 feet so you may be gasping to catch your breath and stopping more often than for a normal hike.\u000a\u000aIn the summer, on weekends, you can ride the chairlift to the top of the ski area and walk back down, ride back down, or enjoy a game of Frisbee golf as you make your way down the run.  \u000a\u000aIf you're lucky, you can see some of Nevada's wild horses as they roam free in the Spring Mountains.\u000a\u000a*************************************************************\u000a\u000aA couple of things to remember about the Recreation Area in 2014.\u000a\u000a*************************************************************\u000a\u000aDue to the Carpenter 1 Fire of 2013, there are several trails and areas that are closed.  These are the Cathedral Rock Trail, the South Loop Trail, the Little Falls Trail, and the Echo Trail.  Fines for hiking in the fire burned area can be as high as $5,000.  It is a federal offense.  Don't be a jerk and hike through the burn area.  You're just impeding the regrowth of the forest and you'll be harming the ecology.  Be a smart user of our shared resources!\u000a\u000aStay out of those areas and you still have a large part of the Recreation Area to explore and use--Lee Canyon and the trails of Deer Creek Road.  These are still open.  Use them.

VI enjoyed my visit to the Da Vinci exhibit yesterday.  There is a lot of reading to do and at first I thought the models might have been made by Da Vinci.  I quickly realized that they were models based on his many drawings.  Nevertheless, I was amazed by the genius of this man.\u000a\u000aI started the exhibit with the Last Supper video that shows the restoration done and how it was messed up by earlier restorations.  Then on to see many models of the weapons Da Vinci drew including the world's first armed tank.  Next came the fascinating section on the Mona Lisa, La Joconde.  The separate sets of photos of the yes, the hands, that smile--all of them made my understanding of this painting so much more than I ever imagined.\u000a\u000aFinally, I went to the section on his flying machines and worked some of the "please touch" machines.  The exhibit ends with a sculpture of Da Vinci's--the only surviving sculpture of his.  It was made from a beeswax created by Da Vinci that has survived for about 500 years.  \u000a\u000aThe exhibit it a bit pricey being $22 with the locals discount.  It is a small space, but I am so glad it's being used instead of sitting empty.  I really enjoyed my visit!

VI came upon this bakery by accident this afternoon.  I was driving away from Starbucks when I noticed a bicycle with loaves of bread in the front basket.  I came back later this afternoon to check out the store.\u000a\u000aThe bakery has homemade cookie creations and they distribute Bon Breads.  Having a store with Bon in the neighborhood is great.  Since I was there after 4 PM, the bread selection was limited.  I ended up buying a package of Bon parmesan lavash.  It is excellent.  \u000a\u000aThe gentleman running the store when I was there explained that they make all their cookies at the shop and they distribute Bon Breads.  It is great to have a place in this section of Summerlin where I can get Bon any day.  I will be back to get some cookies.  I was offered a sample, but I graciously declined after having had a sample bread stick.\u000a\u000aA note on where the store is.  It's on the side of the strip mall facing Rachel's Kitchen behind the Starbuck's outlet.  Unless you know it's there, it's very easy to miss.  It opened at the end of April and I have been to that Starbucks several times and I never saw the store until I noticed that bicycle today!  I'm glad I found it.

VThis show is quite enjoyable but there are some problems with it.  One of them is the story, or lack thereof.  There is a small story that moves the action from one song to another but doing over 20 songs in an hour and 25 minutes doesn't leave much time for a plot.  \u000a\u000aIf you go to the show expecting you'll hear the Beach Boys, you will and you won't.  Some of the songs, duets for example, don't come across as sounding like the Beach Boys but that's OK.  Just don't expect all the songs to be like the originals.\u000a\u000aI did like the projection of scenery onto the screens.  In the beginning I thought it was too busy, but after the opening, the videos added to the show.  My favorite scene was the one riding the ferris wheel on the pier.  It was a stunning visual!\u000a\u000aThe cast is a mixed bag.  In the beginning, I thought Brooke was a bit shrill but that changed as the show went along.  Some of Tanner's singing is just weak.  I wish they hadn't made the "fat" kid the nerd.  Why is that always done?\u000a\u000aI think the price of the show is also a negative.  I expect tickets may show up in half priced venues.  If not, the show won't last long.  Last night's attendance was awful.  Probably less than 25% of the house was occupied.  That can't continue if the show is to survive.  Perhaps they have full houses on the weekend.\u000a\u000aIf you get a deal on tickets, I'd see the show.  I enjoyed it.  It's not a show I'd go back and see again like I have with most shows on the Las Vegas Strip.\u000a\u000aOne final recommendation, if you go, get the cheaper tickets.  The theatre isn't a huge one and you'll be able to take in the graphics on the screen and see all the dancing and other things quite well.  I sat in the front row behind the VIP section, and I thought it was just too close at times.  I should add that I think the seats are the narrowest of any theatre I generally attend in Las Vegas.

VMost of our hiking group got together on Friday for breakfast and Sun City Café was recommended by one of our group who had been here and they knew they could handle a group our size (11 or 13 this time--I didn't take roll).\u000a\u000aThe server was good enough to ask if we wanted separate checks and he did that for each and every one of us--above and beyond!  \u000a\u000aI ordered the special of the day which was a Tex/Mex kind of omelette made with pulled pork and topped with salsa verde and some tortilla strips.  You had a choice of hash browns or breakfast potatoes with onions and peppers.  I went with the breakfast potatoes.  Some in the group subbed fresh fruit for potato and toast.  I had rye toast.\u000a\u000aThe omelette was OK.  Even though the kitchen was busy with our orders and the other customers, the wait was not long.  It wouldn't have mattered as we were engaged in good conversation and much kidding.  \u000a\u000aThe restaurant is a very pleasant place and I'm sure I'll be back in the future.  There were some pancakes on the menu that sounded great!

VPart two of my dinner and show last night was Jersey Boys.  I really like the show because the songs of the Four Seasons and Frankie Valli This jukebox musical is unlike others I've seen because this one has a true story behind it and it helps make the show a real winner.\u000a\u000aI have seen the show three times--twice at the Venetian and now once at Paris.  I have seen three different people play Frankie Valli and I can only say that they've all been very good.  Last night, the Valli part was played by Graham Fenton.  He has a good voice for the role and does it well!\u000a\u000aThe entire cast is good, and the band is excellent.  The one scene where the brass players come out on the walkway above the stage is especially rich with their good sound.\u000a\u000aThe small set pieces come on stage and off quickly, generally brought by cast members between scenes and especially when your attention is deliberately drawn elsewhere.  Nice staging!  The lighting is very well done and really adds to the show as do the video screens behind and to the sides.\u000a\u000aI was in the 5th row center orchestra and it was a great place to see the show.  I felt like I could reach out and slap Tommy upside the head myself!\u000a\u000aAt the end, it was very good to see an acquaintance come out for a bow at the top of the spiral staircase--Keith Thompson.  Keith is the musical director/conductor for Jersey Boys and he does a fantastic job!\u000a\u000aThis is a very good show and I highly recommend putting it on your Las Vegas vacation agenda!

VMy mother taught me that a small sandwich for lunch was a nutritious mid-day meal.  She was right, but she never knew about Sweet Addiction.  My mid-day meal was an ice cream sandwich made with two fresh cookies and a nice amount of ice cream.  It makes absolute nutritional sense to me!\u000a\u000aOn entering the store, I'm sure I had that "deer in the headlights" look.  One of the staff  immediately asked me if it was my first time there.  Answering in the affirmative, she explained what they sell and how it's served.  She was wonderful, and I felt like a long time valued customer almost from the get go.  That's good customer service for a place that's only been opened two weeks.\u000a\u000aAfter the explanation, I ordered a cookie sandwich with chocolate malted crunch ice cream.  I opted to get two of the same cookies rather than mix.  I need to save that option for my next visit.  I chose the chocolate brownie cookie.  These cookies are marvelous.  It's a soft brownie in the shape of a cookie with a rich, chocolatey taste.  \u000a\u000aThe cookie sandwich is served in a styrofoam bowl, so if you're a drip like me, they go into the bowl and not on the table or your napkin or worse--your pants.  Even so, I still had chocolate fingers and I probably had some chocolate in my beard.  They have bathrooms so you can wash off the excess you can't lick off--well not politely anyway.\u000a\u000aI spoke with the owner about hiking and his beginning mountain biking and I felt like I was talking with people I already knew.  It's a very comfortable, easy place to go.  And, it certainly is addictive.  I may have to switch now and then the Wallyworld I go to so as not to be tempted to make this a weekly stop.  I'll have to hike extra this week to work off this nutritious mid-day meal.  Thanks, mom!  And, thanks to the Yelpers that discovered this place and let me in on it.  I'm glad they didn't keep it a secret.\u000a\u000aHappy mountain biking and hiking (for the ladies of the store)!

VI was at the Palms yesterday and decided to have lunch in the food court.  I haven't eaten at an Earl of Sandwich before so this was mt chance to try something new.\u000a\u000aI ordered an Earl's Club made with turkey, bacon, swiss cheese, with lettuce, tomato and their sandwich sauce.  I got a bag of chips and a medium drink.  \u000a\u000aAfter ordering, you're given a buzzer and you can stand around or have a seat in the food court.  When the buzzer goes off, you walk to the pick up area and get your sandwich.  While the club was good, this is not a stop for which I'd drive to.  There are many other choices close to home that are as good or better than the Earl.  It was A-OK.

VThis review is for the 2013 Chocolate and Pastry show.  It sounds from reading the reviews from last year that much is the same.  I, too, got a Groupon for VIP admission and it was so worth it to have an hour to forage before the doors were opened to the general public.\u000a\u000aThere was some very good chocolate.  There was also the dried meat table but I didn't wait in line for that.  By then I was in such caloric overdrive that I wasn't in any mood for some real food.  I just wanted the sugar stuff.\u000a\u000aFor the hotels, the desserts made by the chefs at Excalibur/Luxor were the tops in look and taste.  But there exquisite chocolates at almost every station you went.\u000a\u000aI don't drink so I really needed some water to cleanse my palate.  Unfortunately, the two large containers were dry.  \u000a\u000aI was so glad I attended this event and I think I'll go again next year with a game plan already being devised.  This plan, however, will have to remain classified.\u000a\u000aThe fact that the event benefits St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital is just icing on the cake.  It was as good as it gets except for one thing--Robin Leach.  He really is well named!

VI went to see "Shades of Sinatra" for the third time last night and the show was great as always!  The show is a very pleasant tribute to Frank Sinatra.  The cast--roughly resembling members of the Rat Pack--sing some of the songs Sinatra made famous and they ask the audience to join in if they remember the songs.  We all do remember, but few people joined in.  Why ruin such good singing coming from the stage?\u000a\u000aThe show has been moved from the Wolf Theatre in the Clarion Hotel to the main showroom.  The production has lost some of its intimacy and the small audience last night seemed lost in the large main theatre compared to the intimate setting of the Wolf which was once Debbie Reynolds' screening room when she owned the hotel.\u000a\u000aThe four singers of "Shades" are Ryan Baker, Lisa Smith, Carmine Mandia, and Larry Liso.  They all give strong performances doing the Sinatra songs.  They also say from the get go that they are not impersonators.  Rather they are tribute artists singing Sinatra's songs.\u000a\u000aAs long as "Shades" is in town, I'll go to see them.  It truly is an enjoyable evening with some good talent!

VWe stopped for dinner last night as it had been awhile since we had Indian food.  Since we got there right at 5 PM which is their opening time, the place was empty and we were seated immediately.  Water was brought quickly and we also ordered regular iced tea.  The server came back and said they were out of regular iced tea and they only had the sweetened raspberry tea.  We got that instead.\u000a\u000aFor an appetizer, we ordered the medhu wada, two deep fried doughnuts made from ground lentils, rice, and black pepper.  With it was served three chutneys or sauces that added some to the dryness of the wada.  The sauces were a tomato based one, a soup, and a coconut based one.  The wadas were very flavorful and after chewing, you got the flavor of the black pepper.  When our server went to clear the dishes, she asked if we wanted to keep any of the chutneys.  I kept the soup and ate it.  It was great!\u000a\u000aFor dinner, my wife ordered the garlic chicken and I ordered Madras curry chicken, spice level 7 on a 1 to 10 basis.  We also ordered some garlic naan.  Dinner came with basmati rice.  We both liked our meals, and we had garlic chicken to bring home for another meal for one of us.  The garlic naan was good. For dessert, we shared a dish of kheer.\u000a\u000aA couple of things keep me from ranking the place higher.  On one of the hottest days this summer, the restaurant was very warm.  I don't like freezing in a place either and I always take a denim long sleeve shirt with me.  I sure didn't need it as I was perspiring and it wasn't from the curry.  Speaking of that, 7 is not high enough for a good spice level.  Their 7 was rather tame and the curry seemed to be lacking some of the rich flavor it should have.  Perhaps I'm spoiled by Thai curry.  I think I need to stay away from indian curry.  The kheer had no pistachio chunks on it which somewhat makes the dish interesting.  I saw the photo that Westie W. posted and I thought that it was really enticing.  The no regular iced tea threw me.  I was going to ask them if I could have some hot water and a tea bag and a glass of ice.  I could have made my own.  Out of iced tea is so lame.  \u000a\u000aWe bought a Yelp deal which is in essence a $5 off deal.  This place is OK, but I won't be returning.  There are good good, fully supplied Indian restaurants in town.

VI enjoyed this show a lot last night.  The singing, choreography, and costumes are great!  The only thing I thought after 3/4 of the way through the show was that I was seeing a re-run with different costumes and different songs.  Nevertheless, the show was very well done.  \u000a\u000aThe dancing is sexy and seductive in the true sense of burlesque.  Somewhere along the way, people got the idea that burlesque meant stripping and it does not.  The dancing is suggestive, but that's what burlesque is.\u000a\u000aOne minor criticism I have of the show was the lighting at times.  It seemed like the lights were fixed and if a dancer strayed from a certain mark, they were no longer lighted well until they moved from the darker area back to the spot.\u000a\u000aThe previous reviewer mentioned that no swear words were used.  Yes indeed, there was a bit of dropping of words by the comedienne, Kathleen Dunbar.  I love Ms Dunbar.  I've seen her do stand up in comedy clubs in las Vegas.  She's very funny and she provides a bit of an interlude twice in the show for the dancers to get a breath, change costumes, and change e the minor scenery in the show--scenery consisting mostly of chairs and pedestals. The male host is OK, but I didn't come to see him.  The young women sitting next to me were turned on my him a lot.\u000a\u000aVegas the Show! was not yet out, so we waited in the lounge area for the audience to walk down the stairs and exit via going around the bar.  One last chance to sell the souvenir photos with the showgirl at the entrance or to buy a drink.  The place was hopping.\u000a\u000aI'll be back to see the show again.  It is good!

VI took the advice of my fellow Yelpers and stopped here for breakfast.  I had looked at the menu online, and I had practically decided what I would have before going, but I looked at the menu in any case.Coffee was brought quickly while I was looking at the menu and reaffirming my decision.  I had to go with the Huevos Motulenos.\u000a\u000aWhat an interesting breakfast!  A corn tortilla topped with black beans, peas, sautéed bananas, and feta cheese with two over easy eggs on top and then topped with red and green chili sauce.  The dish comes with home fried potatoes.  Since this is a breakfast and lunch restaurant only, these home fries are made from scratch. These aren't cubed potatoes left over from last night's baked potatoes.  I watched as the one cook cut the potatoes and then stirred them as they grilled.\u000a\u000aThe menu states that this is a zesty dish.  It was excellent!  I could have used a little Cholula, but I decided to have it as it was served than eat breakfast with lots of hot sauce like I'm known to do.  Service was very good.\u000a\u000aI like this small new place--open only 2 months--and it does have a "loft" kind of vibe like another reviewer stated.  My only complaint is parking over which Eat has no control.\u000a\u000a----End of review\u000a\u000a----Editorial follows:\u000a\u000a** Note to the mayor and city council **\u000a\u000aIf you're going to have meters, convert them so you can pay with a credit card like other cities.  I don't walk around with parking meter change in Las Vegas.  Better yet, take them out.  If you want us to continue to come downtown, make it a bit easier!

VI was to the Bacchanal shortly after it opened over a year ago for a Yelp Elite event.  Some friends from out of town decided this would be a good place for a late lunch and it was.\u000a\u000aThere is a wonderful selection.  My favorites were the oysters on the half shell, the lamb chops, and the oyster shooter.  I could have been blissfully filled with those three items but I tried several other things.  The lobster bisque was very good.  There were also some nice salads.\u000a\u000aI did notice that there were a couple of things missing from the opening.  There was no tomahawk steak and there were no macarons at the dessert station (that's almost an unforgivable fail!)\u000a\u000aThe Bacchanal still is one of the better buffets on the Strip.  It's pricey but when you have friends with a comp, it's just great!

VI really enjoyed Zarkana.  It's more circus than any other Cirque shows.  It moves along well.  The two most attention grabbers for me were the music and the graphics projected on the panels in back of the performers.  They were just amazing and added so much to the live performers.\u000a\u000aThe show is a series of circus acts, some the same that you've seen in other Cirque shows, and some that are new or have a new twist.  Throughout, there are two clowns who are very captivating and funny.  They grab your attention and you can't help but smile and laugh.\u000a\u000aI really don't care if there's a story or not.  It's nebulous at best.  For those who want a story, go see a play.  If you want to see some excellent performers who do great circus acts, then see Zarkana.

VWe had a Yelp evening here Monday night and it was a pleasure to drive around the Speedway and enjoy the lights.  I like the tunnel of lights section and it's fun driving under the stands by the concrete pillars and looking at the various designs.\u000a\u000aSome of the hotel sponsors' lights were quite nice.  There were also some NASCAR oriented displays.\u000a\u000aIt's a very pleasant drive of about 2 miles to enjoy the festive display.\u000a\u000aThanks to our CM, Drew, for arranging the Yelp night!

VThis show opened last Friday after being at the small theatre at NY NY Hotel and Casino.  It is now on the mezzanine floor of the Planet Hollywood Casino near Koi at the top of the escalator in what is called the Showroom at Planet Hollywood.  It is not near the large concert hall in the Miracle Mile Shops.  Seating in this venue is triple what it was at NY NY.  I did not see the show at NY NY because I disliked that venue so much.  \u000a\u000aThere isn't scenery for the show per se.  There are two risers joined by a set of stairs that go from the stage to the two levels.  The risers light up in different colors as programmed.  Other than that, there are four banks of light tubes that change colors.  Except for a few props for some of the dances, that's it.  It's basically a song and dance show and is not meant to be a scenic one.\u000a\u000aI had a comp ticket for this show and took advantage of it.  The title is misleading to say the least.  While you expect an evening of dances to ABBA music, only the first 5 or 6 numbers are ABBA.  The rest are from the disco era of the late 70s and the 80s with a little Motown thrown in.  I'm not a fan of ABBA--I wasn't one who liked Mamma Mia all that much, but I really liked the way they started the show last night with Dancing Queen and other ABBA numbers including Fernando.\u000a\u000aThen, Avis Ellis was introduced as a world renowned recording artist.  I had never heard of her before but that's no big surprise.  She sang a song of Whitney Houston's that I enjoyed.  She has a big voice and big hair.  I guess you'd consider her the star vocalist because she was only one introduced by name.  I Googled her to see some of her bio.\u000a\u000aAfter Ellis sang, they went into the disco era with an homage to Saturday Night Live and disco music.  In between the numbers, half the dancers were offstage changing for their parts in an upcoming song.\u000a\u000aThe show lasted exactly 75 minutes and it started on time at 9 PM as advertised.  They deserve a star for that!\u000a\u000aA word about seating.  I would not recommend the VIP table seats up front with the small round tables.  You are close to the stage, but you also have to turn around to see some of the singers behind you because they come out on the three walkways built for Peepshow.  Also, you're in a pit-like area, and you'll be constantly looking up.  The rest of the seating is normal theatre style.  I only dislike how small the seats are.  I almost groped the woman next to me just trying to get my phone.\u000a\u000aThe show is less than a week old and I'm cutting them some slack for some incorrect moves with the dances last night.  There are some new cast added with the larger venue and I think they need more time to settle in.  The show is loud.  I did spend the entire time tapping my foot to the music and at one time I quietly sang along.  I did not clap as performers like to prompt audiences to do.  If you're so good, we'll clap along.  We don't need your advice.\u000a\u000aAll in all, I thought the show was good and I would go again.  When I leave a theatre with a big smile and have liked the music I heard, it was a good show.  I checked the website and saw that the tickets start at $69.50.  I know this is a large cast, but I wish Las Vegas producers would not overprice their shows just so they can be sold at discount ticket outlets.  Set a reasonable price and sell your own seats and the discounters won't be so needed.

VThe Arts District is alive and growing as evidenced by the grand opening of the Art Square Theatre on Friday, September 21, 2012.  The theatre is a 99 seat black box.  Seating for this production was on two sides facing a raised stage that was on a diagonal to the seating set up which gave great line of sight to everyone.  Up the hall are bathrooms, so the place is a great venue and they have a super lineup of shows planned for this inaugural season.\u000a\u000aThere is plenty of parking even for a Saturday night behind the theatre.  Across the hallway from the theatre is an entrance to the Artifice Bar and Lounge--nice for having drinks before or after a show.\u000a\u000aThe first show being done is called "Nurture." It's a witty play filled with lots of good laughs.  It also provokes a lot of thought.  The play was the winner of the 2012 Sin City New Play Contest, an award well deserved!  The acting was superb!!\u000a\u000aLas Vegans, put down the remote, buy a ticket online and have it on your smart phone so you don't need to worry about printing tickets or forgetting them.  Get out and support the arts in Las Vegas.  This theatre and company deserve your support!

VWith the very positive Yelp reviews, I had to stop and try Suzuya and I'm glad I did. I probably came at the wrong time of the day--around 3 PM, and the selection was less than shown in the other reviews/photos here.   I bought 4 pastries, two chocolate cakes, a Kabocya chestnut Mont Blanc, and the green tea cake.\u000a\u000aI did not eat the chocolate cake as that was for my wife.  She thought it was very, very good.  My favorite of the other two I bought for myself varied.  The Kabocya chestnut Mont Blanc was superb!  The chestnut was fantastic and the pastry cream was excellent.  I thought the green tea cake was OK but it wasn't anything special.  I do want to go back and try one of their crèpes.  They were making some while I was there and they look delicious!\u000a\u000aA word about service.  Because they were making the crèpes, and two people were needed--one to watch the crèpe on the griddle and one to fill them, the wait for service was a bit longer.  After a fairly long wait, a gentleman came from the baking area and started to help.  Everyone was apologetic for the wait and thanked me for my patience.  I will be coming back and trying some of their other goods.

VI went here last night to attend the show Stars in Concert.  I had been to this theatre about 7 years ago for another show.  The theatre has been changed some since that time and the changes are good.\u000a\u000aThis venue is really a great, smaller venue.  There are about 40 round tables on the floor each seating 4 people.  In addition, there are 5 rows of theatre style seats in the back.  I sat in the first row here, and it was very comfortable and I had great sight lines.  Again, it's a small venue so you can see well wherever you are.  The theatre has good sound and the lighting was well done for the show.  \u000a\u000aThere's a lounge area with bar before you enter the theatre so if you're early, you can have a drink and relax.  Seating was done promptly 15 minutes before show time.  The employees I came into contact with last night were all very pleasant with great smiles and were very helpful from ticketing to seating.\u000a\u000aThe only drawback may be finding the place the first time you go there.  You need to remember you enter a small alley just north of Walgreens and before McDonalds.  Parking is available behind the theatre and it's a short distance down this alley.\u000a\u000aA word about the show.  I came to see Stars in Concert which is in its first week at this theatre.  The show was very good.  Rotating impersonators sing live music of famous people.  There was a 4 piece band on a platform raised above the stage.  Last night, there were impersonators of Tina Turner, Michael Jackson, Elton John, Beyonce, Whitney Houston, and the Soul Brothers.  All music is live.  There is no lip syncing!  Not a bad show at all.\u000a\u000aI'll be back for another show which goes on earlier.

VI stopped here as I do periodically to get some items on sale.  Smith's had some items in their mailer that were very nicely priced--great loss leaders.\u000a\u000aWhile this isn't the newest of stores, it's clean and I am able to get in and out pretty quickly.  Therefore, it's A-OK for me!

VI knew that somewhere near the M Resort was the ranch where the lions that used to be transported to and from the MGM Grand's Lion Habitat lived.  Today, I went with some freinds from out of town and saw the lions.\u000a\u000aThere are 40 adult lions and 7 cubs.  Two of the cubs are small enough that you can pay ($30) to have your photo taken with them.  You can touch the fur up to the back of the neck, not forward of it, as some women who had the photo taken told us.\u000a\u000aAdmission to the ranch is $20 per person.  There are tours that cost more and you can do a trainer for a day which sets you back about two meals at Joël Robuchon.\u000a\u000aWe were there at 11 AM when the gate rolled back and you're given entrance to the parking lot.  You sign a waiver, pay your money, and go on your way on a walking tour of the pens.  Today was one of the warmest days so far this spring and the adults pretty much were just lying around.  The cubs, on the other hand, were quite active because a handler was in their pen with them and was playing with them.  He'd throw a large ball and they'd chase it and each other.  It was quite fun and the handler was an employee of the company for several years so he had a lot of knowledge to impart.  He readily answered questions.  Very personable guy.\u000a\u000aAfter about an hour and a half, we had seen about all we wanted.  I would give this a full five stars if they'd let me get in and play with the cubs, too, but alas that won't happen!

VDinner at McCall's Heartland Grill  was a great start to a fun evening at the Stratosphere.  When I was here in May to see Pin Up, I walked around the casino to see if anything had changed because I hadn't been to the Stratosphere in many years.  As I was walking around, McCall's caught my eye.  I didn't see a menu outside but I checked it out when I got home.  Since I had a ticket to see Frankie Moreno last night, I made a reservation at McCall's to give the place a try.\u000a\u000aI started out getting the PBB&J crostini, something I'd read in Yelp reviews.  How could I resist?  It's 4 slices of toasted baguette with peanut butter, bacon, bleu cheese and drizzled with jalapeño jelly on a bed of some shredded lettuce, sliced cucumber, red onion, and some red bell pepper.  It is excellent and what a different start to a meal.  The only thing I'd do differently is to up the jalapeño in the jelly and give it some kick.  The appetizer was delightful!  While eating the crostini, a server brought the bread basket.  Wow!  What a selection!  I had one cheese stick because I had enough bread with the crostini and I didn't want to fill up on bread.\u000a\u000aFor the main course, I got the coffee rubbed NY Strip steak with bleu cheese butter.  I got a side of their cheese croquettes.  The steak was done perfectly, charred on the outside, blue on the inside.  The cheese croquettes were good but I would have used more cheese or a stronger cheese.  It just didn't have a strong cheese flavor.  Both dishes had very thin slices of leeks that were blanched in hot oil just enough to give them a crisp.  What a tasty and different topping to food rather than a sprig of parsley!\u000a\u000aYes, of course I had room for dessert, and I ordered the triple chocolate flourless cake.  It was very good.  Rich chocolate with whipped cream that was thick and seemed to have some mascarpone whipped in.  \u000a\u000aService was excellent.  Everyone at McCall's had a smile, greeted customers very pleasantly, and were courteous and helpful and it started with the hostess.  My server was VInce and he was top notch.  He checked back with me every course at least once, and he refilled my iced tea without me needing to ask.  The only service fail was my obsession with keeping the table clean.  It wasn't until the end of the meal that a server removed my three empty artificial sugar packets.  That's my gold standard of excellent service all other things being equal.\u000a\u000aI'll come back to McCall's.  It really is a nice room, nothing too fancy, but good food at good prices for being on the Las Vegas Strip--even the North Strip.

VI was surprised when I came to Honey Salt for the first time last night to find that they were having their 1st Anniversary special, a three course dinner for $29.99.  They had a burger special, too, but instead of the scallops I had planned to order, I went with the prix fixe anniversary menu.\u000a\u000aThe meal started with an amuse-bouche--a demi tasse size cup of their squash soup with toasted pumpkin seeds and pumpkin seed oil.  It was very tasty and it's a draw to get me back to try more.\u000a\u000aI was brought the standard metal container with two slices of bread and two of lavash and some honey butter.  The breads were good.\u000a\u000aThe first course was a salad with pork belly.  The pork belly was cooked nicely and the greens had a tasty vinaigrette dressing.  There were red and yellow plum tomatoes in the salad.\u000a\u000aThe second course was ahi tuna.  It was seared perfect;y with a red interior.  The ahi was served on red and white quinoa and some of their house made salsa.  The seasoning of the quinoa and the ahi were excellent!\u000a\u000aFor dessert, the only course with a choice, I went with their butterscotch pudding.  It came in a glass jar and on the lid were some Cracker Jacks.  The lid was removed by the server and placed on the plate.  There was a layer of cookie crumb beneath the pudding and then some chocolate pudding below.  Great!\u000a\u000aService was as good as some of the top restaurants on the Strip.  I never had more than a few sips of my iced tea when the beverage person was at the table refilling my tea.  When I got coffee with dessert, he was back twice to refill my cup.  My server, Erik, was a pleasant, genial man and he made me feel welcome for my first visit to Honey Salt.  \u000a\u000aHappy 1st Anniversary Honey Salt.  I'm glad I finally got there!

VI missed breakfast so I decided to make up for it my having a healthy lunch.  I chose from two of my favorite food groups--ice and cream.\u000a\u000aOn entering the shop, I bypassed the "normal" flavors and went right to the Asian flavors.  I got a 2 scoop lunch, one scoop of durian and one scoop of red bean. The scoops are very generous size portions.   I took the cup outside and sat on the small sidewalk patio with a table and a couple of chairs and enjoyed the ice cream while looking at the mountains on the west side of town.\u000a\u000aThe durian ice cream was excellent!  It had a good, rich flavor and the ice cream was smooth.  The red bean was not up to the same standard.  There were some ice crystals and it wasn't as smooth as the durian.  Mind you, it was good and I liked the fact that it wasn't as sweet as some red bean treats.\u000a\u000aThe woman running the shop was very, very pleasant.  I stopped in as I was ready to leave to give her a thumbs up for the ice cream and she was appreciative.  Now I have to return and try the taro and other flavors and perhaps get a pint of durian to bring home.\u000a\u000aA couple of things about The Perfect Scoop.  I have driven by here probably 20 times since I read the first review and I would never see the shop.  The back of this strip mall fronts Fort Apache and the entrances to these shops are on the west side hidden from the main street.  If you use the Yelp app, use the mapping feature and it will bring you right where the shop is and you'll see the smiley face toward Fort Apache.  Second, another reviewer mentioned that there's nothing on display.  I thought they were out of many flavors when I first went in and saw the plastic lids that appeared to cover empty spaces.  Then I noticed the woman packing ice cream for another customer and I knew what was going on.  This is a tough one.  I guess the ice cream stays better when it's covered than being left open like at other ice cream/gelato places but it is nice to window shop at an ice cream place, too!\u000a\u000aRegardless, this is good ice cream, made in house by people who obviously care about their product, and I am sure I'll be back.  The durian is calling me!

VOur meals were OK and service started out well and then went downhill.  I should have paid more attention to the reviews of my two friends on Yelp.  Live and learn.\u000a\u000aWe were here about 4:15 yesterday afternoon and there were very few people there.  We were seated immediately and brought menus and drinks.  The chips and salsas were brought and our server explained that the warm salsa was spicy and the cold salsa was not spicy.  The chips and spicy salsa were good.  The chips are very thin and I found I broke several in half dipping them in the salsa.\u000a\u000aFor our dinners, I ordered the Tacos al Pastor.  Here's the description from their menu:  Spicy pork with pineapple, pico de gallo and cilantro.  My wife ordered the Tampico which is described as: Grilled chicken breast topped with sautéed artichoke hearts, mushrooms, spinach, red bell peppers with sour cream-poblano sauce and monterey jack cheese.\u000a\u000aMy tacos were just OK.  The biggest problem with them was there was only one taco.  When I get tacos like this at genuine Mexican places, they're always doubled so there's some body to help hold the filling.  With my tacos and the single shell, the pico was wet enough that it softened the taco and made it almost impossible to pick up to eat.  I did eat the first one that way but I was awash in juice.  The pork was OK, but the spice was a heavy coating on the pork.  It was spicy but other than that, there wasn't a whole lot to recommend the tacos.  I also thought of the al pastors I've gotten from street vendors on East Charleston for a fraction of the cost I paid.  Stupid me!  With my tacos came rice and black beans.  My wife liked her chicken and it was as described.  It's the kind of dish you might get at any Tex/Mex kind of restaurant.\u000a\u000aDessert was the star of the night.  I got the très leches cake and she got the Mexican brownie.  My cake was excellent.  Her brownie came with a bit of table side ta da!\u000aThe brownie was placed on a very hot cast iron dish safely in a recessed wooden holder.  Then the vanilla ice cream was put on top of the brownie.  LAst, the sauce was poured over the ice cream and when the sauce hit the hot dish, it bubbled and made a kind of extra buttery syrup that added to the flavor of the brownie and ice cream.  \u000a\u000aNow to service:  Up until the time we got our meals, everything was going along fine.  Then our server disappeared.  She came back once and asked about the food and then was gone again.  10 minutes after we finished our dishes, she was nowhere to be found.  The host looked at us several times and it seemed as though he was going to get her at one point but that was not the case.  Finally she showed and we asked about a box and asked about dessert.  She said she'd get the dessert tray and be back.\u000a\u000aAgain she was just gone.  About 5 minutes later, another server stopped and asked if we wanted a box.  We told him we'd already asked for one and then he brought his tray down to show us the desserts. We made our choice with him.  A few minutes later, our server and this second person arrived with the desserts.  She stood by as he did the table ta da for the brownie.  Then she left again.  About 6 minutes later, she came back with the check and just put it down.  \u000a\u000aWhen I finished dessert and we had some time to relax and talk, I got my credit card out and put it in the holder and within 10 seconds, she was there to pick it up.  Wow, Speedy Gonzales then but not at the needed times.  \u000a\u000aI really like Tivoli Village and there are some other restaurants there that I have yet to try.  But, Cantina Laredo won't be one of them.  We have so many small places along East Charleston that there's no reason to ever go here again.

VA couple of times when I've scanned my players card at a kiosk at the Palms, out came a coupon for some offer at Chocolat.  One time I looked in the food court and it wasn't there so I had no idea where in the Palms this place might be.\u000a\u000aYesterday I parked in the east garage and as I was walking in the casino, I happened to glance to the hotel registration area and just to the right was Chocolat!  Mystery solved.  It does exist.\u000a\u000aAfter playing for awhile, I decided to walk over and check it out.  I'm glad I did.  I wasn't in the mood for flatbread or a crèpe but the thought of gelato on an upper 90 degree day was enticing.  I saw on their board that they had Nutella gelato.  Well, they do and they don't.  It's one of their flavors but only in a rotating fashion and it wasn't one of the flavors yesterday.  A medium cup allows two scoops so I got one scoop of Oreo cookie and one scoop of macadamia nut.  Both were good but the macadamia nut was better.\u000a\u000aThe woman at the counter was very pleasant.  I took the gelato and sat at one of their small tables just outside the entrance.  Now that I know where Chocolat is, I'll check my offers at the kiosk and probably I'll be back for more.  The flat bread looked very interesting.\u000a\u000aThe only complaint I have is those damn little spoons they give you with gelato.  Give me a man sized spoon.  next time I go, I'll slip a plastic spoon from one of the yogurt places in my pocket and I'll be able to eat the gelato in a less genteel but more satisfying way!

VWhen I first moved to Las Vegas 11+ years ago, this was a place I came to often to walk.  Then the first summer hit, and I joined a gym so I could exercise and walk indoors where it was air conditioned.  Now, I use this park mainly to ride my bike.  It stretches about 1.25 miles from behind Costco just west of Pavilion Center Drive to its end at Hualapai Way.  \u000a\u000aParking is only available in one area--on Cotton Bluff Circle just north of Park Run Drive west of Town Center.  There are three areas of green--one at the beginning by Pavilion Center, one at Town Center, and one at the end by Hualapai.  The Town Center and Hualapai areas have tables where you can sit, have a snack or picnic, and enjoy yourself.\u000a\u000aA lot of people use the park for walking their dogs, and as Peter S. said, there will be dogs chasing rabbits in the park.  Since it was so cold and cloudy this morning, there were very few people in the park and I saw 8 rabbits as I rode this mile plus.  That's more than normal.\u000a\u000aThis is one of my favorite places.  Summerlin was very smart to put a sidewalk and green areas in this arroyo and create a super park!

VMy main goal today was to ride this trail.  When I'be been in the area, I've seen the trail and I thought I'd bring my bike and park in the M Resort's garage and then bike the trail.  Instead, I changed my plans and biked two other trails to reach this trail.\u000a\u000aI rode from Seven Hills Drive west to the trailhead and then rode it back to the Cactus Wren Park and then to the Cactus Wren Trail for the way back to my parked car.\u000a\u000aThis trail is really nicely done!  There are interpretive markers showing the animals of the desert you might see along the trail.  There are also a number of sculptures with these animals.  \u000a\u000aThere are several streets that go off to the south, but since this area is not growing right now, you can easily cross those streets with ease.  I agree with the other posters that there should be some kind of bridge over Eastern Avenue.  Although I didn't have any trouble crossing, I used the crossing lights and I was alert to drivers as I did.  I must say I saw several very courteous drivers who held back on their right turns to let me cross.\u000a\u000aOne things Henderson needs to do is mark the trails better.  Periodically there's a map of the trails near one of the entrances.  They use a color code which is often misleading because there are shades of the same color and it makes it difficult to distinguish one trail from the next.\u000a\u000aThis is an ideal walk or ride for a family.  I saw many out today enjoying the warm November weather and the day off from school.

VI read some of the Yelp reviews and had Manan Bakery bookmarked for a couple of months,  Yesterday, I stopped in as I was coming back home.  The bakery is a small shop with two cases, but they are filled with delicious looking goodies.  There were many things with names I didn't recognize.  I asked the woman what some of those things were and she was happy to explain.\u000a\u000aInstead of going with some of the newer things, I opted for two tried and true bakery goods--a chocolate mousse and a raspberry mousse.  I had the raspberry last night and it was excellent.  The light chocolate exterior that surrounds the mousse is very delicate and very tasty.  Chocolate and raspberry go so well together.\u000a\u000aI noticed several items in the cases I'd like to try in the future, so I will  be back.

VI spend a lot of time riding on the Western Beltway Trail whether it's this section or the section that continues south to Tropicana.\u000a\u000aThe trail gives you freedom to ride with greater security than on the streets.  You still have to cross Hughes Park Drive, Sahara, and Charleston but when I ride on Sundays, these streets are generally quiet.\u000a\u000aThe trail north also is one of the best viewing areas for the annual July 4th fireworks at Red Rock Casino.  I ride over about 8:45 and then watch the show at 9.  The path is great for that.  Note:  Metro allows cars to jump the curb and park here for the fireworks so ride or walk there with care.\u000a\u000aThere is an odd curve to the trail at Hughes Park Drive.  The trail ends on he south side and you have to cross HP Drive and then head west on Hughes Park.  Then the trail starts again and does a little loop back until you're at the top of the small hill.  You're then on level ground and can ride to Charleston.\u000a\u000aThe trail north will soon be longer.  The city is extending the trail from Charleston Boulevard to Alexander Road using Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act funds.  This past weekend, Far Hills Avenue was closed for them to install the new bridge which will allow pedestrians and riders to go over Far Hills without stopping.  The path will go under Alta Drive.  Tentative completion date for the extension is May 1, 2014.  When the extension is done, there will be a 10 mile one way ride from Trop to Alexander.  What a ride it will be coming back up the hill from Alexander to the Summerlin parkway.\u000a\u000aThe trail is great!  Give it a try.

VI didn't know what to expect of the show before hand because I don't know Shania Twain's music.  I am not a fan of country but I had been told that the show was a wonderful production even if the music wasn't especially my type.\u000a\u000aI sat in the first row of the rear orchestra near the sound booth, so I had a great seat.  The show started 8 minutes late--about standard for non-Cirque du Soleil shows so that was nothing to be upset about.  The first few numbers lulled me into thinking it was going to be a good show.  The Colosseum's LED screen was used well.  The songs also tended to sound more rock than country.  This was part I of the show.\u000a\u000aPart II is where the show started going downhill for me.  Twain is very good getting out among the audience, pressing the flesh, getting hugs, and participating in selfies.  Yes, Virginia, they do allow cameras if she's there and you pull yours out for a shot with her.  She waded into the audience twice, and I suppose if you're a fan, this would be the sine qua non for the super Twainer.  In between the two forays into the audience, she did a campfire number on the stage with audience members--some pre-selected--but all from the special Twain lovers seating area in the first few rows.  She talked briefly with each of the audience members and then had them sit behind this faux campfire which had been burning during her talk with the folks on stage.  She sang two songs and asked the audience to join in with the second song.  This whole campfire bit was a big fail for me.\u000a\u000aWe then moved to the last part.  As she was changing, a forest appeared on the LED screen with a black horse.  A fire was burning in the forest and it seemed like the horse would be trapped, but he managed to make it out.  The fire is now out and it begins to snow and the horse changes from black to white.  Then Miss Twain rides out on a white horse.  It looked like the horse was standing on a padded area and had padded hoof coverings and she removed his sparkly lead.  She then sang her iconic, "You're Still the One."  Score for me--I know this song.  However, the horse loves this song too, and he soon showed very visibly how much he cared for Miss Twain.  The people in my area were snickering through much of the song and continued as she led the horse off stage at the end of the song.\u000a\u000aThe band came out and it almost sounded like they were going to end the show with a rousing rock number.  Nope!  She came back out and the show ended with two country numbers.\u000a\u000aA couple of things that struck me about the show.  I love animals and while hiking today, I saw four wild horses in Red Rock Canyon.  The last thing an animal lover would think of would be having a horse in a fire.  I thought it was an awful premise and I wondered who thought it up.  I also wondered if Elton John left a Candle in the Wind on the stage and it set Miss Twain's forest on fire.  Second, one confetti drop is enough.  This show has three although one is supposed to be part of the snowstorm that changes the black horse white.  Third, the folksy bit wore thin quickly with me.  She may be a very folksy person but it seemed contrived.  Last, her voice is good, but not that good.  There were quite a few seats in the first and second mezzanines empty last night.  Is the market voting on her show?  This wouldn't be a show I'd see again unlike the other performers at the Colosseum.

VThis was the Tuesday my wife's cleaning lady comes.  Every two weeks, I come back from the gym, shower quickly, and then make a quick escape from the two so I don't have to hear their silly chatter.  More important, they want me the hell out of the way!\u000a\u000aI needed to make a stop downtown anyway so I quickly decided to head for this Denny's.  I've driven by after a show several times and I wanted to try it. I parked in the city owned garage below Neonopolis and it's a short walk one flight up to get to the store areas and the Denny's.  The entrance is on the side.\u000a\u000aI ordered a Start Up omelette which is a 3 egg omelette with a choice of cheese and comes with toast and hash browns or grits.  I got tomato slices instead of the toast and grits.  I had already been brought fresh coffee.\u000a\u000aThe omelette was a standard one with a fair amount of cheese inside.  The tomato slices were a nice change from the carbs of the breakfast sides.  The plate was one of the hottest plates I've touched in quite awhile and it kept the breakfast warm while I ate.\u000a\u000aMy server was a young woman who was very pleasant.  She brought me some Cholula as requested.  That's always a bonus.\u000a\u000aOne criticism--the small booths are really small!!  It would be hard to fit two standard sized adults in the space.  I pushed the table almost to the far side of the booth.  Sit at the counter or outside.\u000a\u000aA couple of things.  They advertise that this is the only Denny's in the world with a wedding chapel.  Well, not really.  There's an area with some wedding photos on the wall and if you want to get married at Denny's in downtown Las Vegas, that's where it will be.  They move the tables aside and you exchange your vows there.  I am aware from the news that there has been a wedding here.  Well, the licenses are sold only a few blocks away.  Second thing, the parking in the garage below Neonopolis is so convenient.  Denny's does not validate for this city owned garage but I had no payment due when I left.  perhaps it was the time of day, the day of the week, or merely the fact that I was here for less than an hour.\u000a\u000aI'll be back.  This is a really nice Denny's.

VOur hiking group goes to Chinatown for a New Year's lunch each January/February.  Today, we went to Bund Shanghai.  One of our group had been here and she liked it very much.  She arranged the lunch ahead of time.  Since she's from Taiwan, there is never a language problem when we're with her in Chinatown.\u000a\u000aFor lunch, the 10 of us shared these Shanghai style dim sum selections: soup dumplings (XLB),  crab and pork soup dumplings, pan fried pork buns, beef fried buns, pot stickers, spicy won ton, rice cake stir fry with pork and cabbage, Shanghai fried thin noodles, red bean pan cake, and eight treasure rice pudding.\u000a\u000aAll of us liked the food very much.  I found the XLB to be a bit bland.  My favorite was the Shanghai fried noodles.  I'd go back just for that.\u000a\u000aService was excellent.  Shirley spoke with the staff for the most part, but the hostess and one of the servers had great English so we'd be OK if we went without Shirley.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant is very nicely appointed.  It's not very large but can hold several large parties like ours at their large round tables.  The parking lot is very, very small!\u000a\u000aI have to come back and try this for a regular dinner, not just dim sum, to get a better feel for the dishes.  But, this was a very good lunch!\u000a\u000aEdit:  My photos don't do justice to most of the dishes.  I was sitting in the wrong section of the circle and those from our group started digging into the dishes before I could get a photo of the entire dish.  Plating was very nicely done!

VI can't give La Belle Terre he full five stars yet, but I hope to go back and get some of their wonderful looking pastries!  Wow!  What a sight!!\u000a\u000aI stopped in to check the place out and to get a few dinner rolls.  I got a half dozen mini ciabatta rolls.  We had two of the rolls with dinner this tonight and they're quite good and just what I wanted!  I think I put on an extra pound just ogling the pastries in the case!  I think they were about to call Metro and report me.\u000a\u000aService was very quick and very friendly.  Again, I thank my fellow Yelperazzi for letting me in on this secret.  I didn't know what was behind the big sign I saw going west on Sahara.  Now I'll be parked under that sign numerous times to come.  \u000a\u000aThe place also helps with your mental ability--in fact it has made me a bit clairvoyant.  I foresee me doing lunch here very soon!  C'est si bon!

VI'll leave my review at 3 stars for now.  This was my first visit to a Panera Bread to get sandwiches for dinner.  We needed a break from getting subs at different places and I chose to try something new.  This location opened recently.  It makes where I live about halfway between to Panera's but I decided to try this one.\u000a\u000aService was great at the counter, but the wait seemed long for the take out until I realized they had a number of people eating in who had ordered just before I got there.  I brought the sandwiches home and they were very good.  My wife had their Cuban chicken panini and I had the signature Steak and white cheddar.  They were both very good.  My panini had a fair kick from the horseradish spread on the sandwich.  With the sandwiches, I opted for the small bag of chips for each of us.\u000a\u000aThe order was packaged really nice in two small cardboard boxes.  My only complaint with this is there's really no way to tell which sandwich is which unless you peel back some of the bread to reveal the contents.  Some places put a numbered sticker on their sandwiches to match the items on your receipt.  The boxes at Panera have a place you could write the name.  I sent a suggestion to HQ and the responded that they'd look into it.\u000a\u000aI'll return and I think I'll eat in.  The dining room is very nice and there's outdoor seating for when it's cooler.

VOur Yelp book club meeting was here this evening.  The hours changed since we planned the event  so we had to cut our discussion of "Legal Tender" short.  We thought we had a least another half hour.\u000a\u000aBeanz seems to be a relaxing place.  There were comfortable chairs and place for the seven of us to sit.  The music was turned off but I didn't know if they knew we were having a meeting of sorts or whether it was because they were closing.  As we got near 7 PM, one of the workers came over and told us they were closing in about 2 minutes.  We were out the door quickly.\u000a\u000aI got a black iced tea and it was good.  Service was fine.  This is a good drive from home so this is not a coffee shop I'd normally come to nor do I think I'll return.

VI stopped here for breakfast yesterday morning partway through my Sunday morning bike ride.  I was here just before 8 AM and they weren't yet open.  Promptly at 8, the door opened and I was shown in.  I was told to sit anywhere.  The first thing I noticed was what a nicely decorated restaurant it was.  It was a sushi restaurant that closed which explains the large amount of bar seating and the food prep going on behind the counter.\u000a\u000aI ordered the special of the day which was a breakfast croissant with 2 eggs cooked the way you want, two sausages or two slices of bacon--your choice--and your choice of cheese.  It also came with breakfast potatoes they called hash browns.  They're really not hash browns but they were very good potatoes.\u000a\u000aEverything was very good.  My coffee was refilled quickly.  Angel, the server, was very pleasant!  I asked her about the Date Nights they're having and she explained and gave me a copy of the menu from their first anniversary Date Night dinner.  Normal date night dinners are $16.95 and you can call to get information about the menu and pricing.  \u000a\u000aAngel brought a case with pastries--doughnuts, cupcakes, etc--and at first I thought she was offering a complimentary one.  When she told me the price, I then knew they weren't freebies.  It wasn't something I wanted with breakfast and since I was riding my bike, I didn't want to take any along to get damaged as I rode along.\u000a\u000aI'll come back here because I do have to try something with a biscuit.

VAs part of the Yelp Helps Week, I volunteered at the Ugly Sweater Run and I was very impressed with how much fun everyone was having.  It is a run but it's not timed.  It starts at 11, not the 8 or 9 start times that some people are accustomed to.  Some people ran, but most simply walked the 5K having lots of laughs as they went along.\u000a\u000aI was impressed at how well everything came off and it was a fun event.  I think I'll volunteer again next year and then walk the 5K.  Anyone have an ugly sweater they want to get rid of?

VI was attending the Vegas Fringe Festival at the Las Vegas Little Theatre in Chinatown and I had enough time between plays to finally give Yu-Yu a try for dinner.  It was about 6:30 and other than one table, I was the only person in the restaurant.  I took a seat at the bar so I could watch the cooking in front of me.  Not much cooking as for most of the time I was there, the only cooking done was  for my order.\u000a\u000aMy server was Noriko, a very pleasant woman who explained the menu to me and explained what kushi-age was and explained the ordering process.  She brought my iced tea and I was set to begin ordering.\u000a\u000aI started with a tapas plate of Tuna yukke which is seasoned big eye tuna with a quail egg on top.  The tuna is accompanied by some thinly sliced cucumber, red onion, and yellow bell pepper.  The tuna was very good.\u000a\u000aNext, I ordered these kushi-age items:  King oyster mushroom, bacon wrapped asparagus, pork filet, curry beef tongue, octopus leg, and black tiger shrimp.  I watched the cook dip my selections in the batter and then drop them into the hot oil which he tended closely and turned the items with his chopsticks.  In a short time, the items were removed from the frying oil and placed on the plate.  Noriko then arranged them on a plate.  When she brought them to me, she told me the order they were on the plate.\u000a\u000aWith the kushi-age, you get a cabbage salad with some sliced carrots.  They also have a variety of sauces you can get or just stay with their original kushi-age dipping sauce which was what I did.  You also get a small dish with two sections--one containing curry powder and one with red sea salt.  I found that the curry powder was the best accompaniment.  Of the 6 kushi-age items I got, hands down, the best was the curry beef tongue.  Dipped with extra curry powder, it was a winner.\u000a\u000aService was good.  I was somewhat uneasy in the restaurant.  The counter area is adjacent to the kitchen entrance.  Since there was almost no one else in the restaurant, I felt like the three servers were watching me all the time I was there.  It made for the good service I mentioned, but because the restaurant is so small and the counter is near their workstation, I felt really watched--not in a bad way, mind you.\u000a\u000aI'm glad I gave Yu-Yu a try.  It's interesting.  The value is not good.  While in line with other tapas style restaurants, the amount of food per price is not good.

VI only had a taste of one of the Pink Box cronuts and it was OK.  I guess my taste buds were soured by the poor service I got when I went to pick up the order that was put in by a friend the day before.  I arrived in the time they had said--between 9 and 9:30.\u000a\u000aFirst, they couldn't find the order, then they found it but asked me what she had ordered.  When I told them cronuts, the counter critter said, "We don't have cronuts.  What did she order?"  When I told them 6 cinnamon sugar and 6 glazed, they just got a box and put regualr doughnuts in the box.  They then tossed the order slip (I wish I had been able to see it) into the trash.  The friend later called and went back and got what she ordered but they couldn't find the slip.  Small wonder.\u000a\u000aThe cronuts from Pink Box are smaller in height than the others we had at our tasting.  I was told that they were much closer to the original cronuts introduced in NYC.  The cinnamon sugar cronut was OK but was greasy compared to the others we tasted.\u000a\u000aThe staff seemed to be in a fog.  Mr. Pink Box was there in his outfit to greet me and bid me adieu, but the business needs someone with organizational skills and smarts at the counter.  You can have the best doughnuts going, but if you give me the wrong stuff, it's a fail in my book!

VCan you take me high enough?  Well, Rock of Ages can!  I came to show not knowing if I'd really like it.  A rock show featuring music from classic rock bands of the 80s?  Who would have thought that I would leave completely loving the show!\u000a\u000aRock of Ages is a jukebox musical with the usual thin story line--enough of a story to string a number of songs together so it makes some sense with the story.  The show is high energy, foot tapping, sometimes hand clapping and hand waving.  It's the kind of show that puts a smile on your face early on and you keep it for the rest of the show.\u000a\u000aI was surprised when I knew more of the songs than I thought I would--"We're Not Gonna Take It" - "Waiting For a Girl Like You" - "Harden My Heart" - "Here I Go Again" - "Any Way You Want It" - "Hit Me With Your Best Shot" to name a few.\u000a\u000aThe show is quite funny at times and the narrator, Lonny, has some great scenes and some very funny off hand comments.  The dancing is wonderful and the real band working in the back almost out of sight is excellent!\u000a\u000aThere is a 7 minute intermission about an hour into the show.  This is described as a quick bathroom break and there's a large clock displayed on a screen at the back of the stage.  The clock is the Whizz Meter 5000 and it counts down from 7 minutes.  There actually was more like 9 minutes so if you run, you may be able to make it back in time.  I stood at my seat to stretch and take some photos.  The show is just about two hours long including intermission and it started almost on time.\u000a\u000aI really can't articulate any better how surprised I was with this show and how much I liked it.  I will be going to see it again, and maybe again another time.  It's not Phantom, but it's damn good!\u000a\u000aCan you take me high enough to fly me over over yesterday?  You bet they can!

VMy wife and I went here for an early dinner this afternoon before a show at the Plaza.  As with some other reviewers, we ordered too much because their portions are really nice on some items even though they're small plates.\u000a\u000aWe started with an order of Tiger Cry and Nachos O'Brien.  I wanted to order the Hodgepodge but they don't serve that anymore.  Instead, the server suggested I get two of the dishes that made up the tower thing so I got pommes frites and Truffle tots.\u000a\u000aThe Tiger Cry and the Nachos O'Brien were both very good.  We shared the dishes and we both liked the nachos and the Tiger Cry.  The hit of the two was the TIger Cry which is Thai beef jerky with nam prik and some sesame.  There was also a container of sticky rice in a ball in a plastic bag.  I'm sot sure it was sticky rice or rice just twisted together in the plastic to make it stick together.  I expected it might be a bit spicy from the nam prik, but it was not.  However, the nam prik they did use along with the jerky glaze made this a great dish.  The nachos were good, but nothing exceptional.  \u000a\u000aMy error was in ordering both pommes frites and truffle tots.  That's a large portion of both in their small pails.  They were both very good, but I ended up eating most of the frites and finishing off the truffle tots.  I didn't taste any truffle but the cheese, parsley, and salt  made the tots very good and I loved the pommes frites.\u000a\u000aWe still had some room and I ordered the Baked and Blazed--their take on a mac and cheese dish but made with fusilli and cheddar cheese and having a nice crusty top.  This was an excellent dish, too.  When we ordered this we mentioned the Cookiemon and he said it takes 15 minutes so we had him put the order in then also.  It came out a little early because we hadn't finished the baked and blazed yet but it was OK.  Only a little ice cream melted and the very hot cookie had time to cool a bit before digging in.\u000a\u000aService was great.  Considering we were the only customers in the place, it should have been great.  But, it was above and beyond that.  Our server answered our questions and suggested things.  He was prompt with iced tea refills and a pleasant fellow.\u000a\u000aI noticed as Tony T. did that the music was pleasant and wasn't blaring.  Conversation was easy and the music didn't interfere.\u000a\u000aI wish this wasn't on the other side of town.  I'd stop in more often.  I do have to make a stop here when I get my car serviced the next time.  I have to try the State Fair or the Uni-cones, or the Warm PB & J.  Well you get where my head's at!

VI first hiked the Lone Mountain Trail in 2005 and I have just driven by on my way to other hikes until today.  Our Las Vegas city gym was closed because of Labor Day so a friend from the gym and I decided to do the relatively short Lone Mountain hike.  Except for the humidity of the monsoon season, the morning was perfect for hiking.\u000a\u000aThe hike is in what I refer to as three sections--Levels 1, 2, and 3.  Level 1 is at the first landing, the first saddle, where there's a bench for taking a rest and enjoying the view.  For some people, that's as far as they go and that's OK.\u000a\u000aFrom here, the trail goes up wonderful limestone rock for the most part with a minimum of gravel or scree of any kind.  At the end of this section, you arrive at what I refer to as Level 2.  From here, it's one more push until you get to the top and you can fully enjoy the views of the Las Vegas Valley.\u000a\u000aLooking south, you see Summerlin and Red Rock Canyon, to the west the Spring Mountains, the the north the Las Vegas Range with Gass Peak and the Sheep Mountains beyond, and finally to the eats you get views of the resorts along the Strip and Frenchman Mountain on the east side of the valley.\u000a\u000aFind a not too sharp area at the top, have a snack and some good conversation, and then return the way you came.  You can come to the peak by either the east or south sides but that should be reserved for experienced hikers because the drops can be fatal if you slip and fall.\u000a\u000aThe easiest access to the trail is to take the 215 and get off at Cliff Shadows Parkway.  Go north on Cliff Shadows to Alexander Road, make a right and head east to vegas Vista Trail which is the last street before Lone Mountain.  Head north of Vegas Vista and there's a parking area at the end of the street where they've put some concrete barricades.  From here, the way is very evident to the trail.\u000a\u000aPS:  Be on the lookout for bees.  They are generally more active in the spring but it pays to watch where you're walking.  In May of 2012, a man was stung continually as he was going to the peak.  It was estimated that he was stung about 300 times.  He was able to dial 911 from the peak and was rescued by helicopter and survived after being in bad shape for several days.  There used to be a sign warning about Africanized bees, but it is now missing.  Just be alert!\u000a\u000aHappy hiking!

V*** Review is for Spring 2013 Restaurant Week Menu ***\u000a\u000aElniño, a friend from Yelp, and I met for lunch at Poppy Den today to try this addition to Tivoli Village.  It was a perfect winter day so we decided to eat out on the patio.  \u000a\u000aFor the first course, I chose Amma's homemade tomato soup with curried whipped cream, cilantro, and extra virgin olive oil.  The tomato soup was very good.  I didn't think the curry whipped cream added anything to the dish but color.  The EVOO on the other had helped bring out the tomato flavor.\u000a\u000aThe second course was monk fish with onion jam and dill ginger, garlic and coriander.  The fish was cooked perfectly and had a good flavor.  It was a nice light fish for a lunch.\u000a\u000aWe also shared an order of quinoa fried rice.  We both enjoyed this.\u000a\u000aThe third course was chips and ice cream.  There were two kinds of homemade ice cream, yuzu and poppyseed and lemon and poppyseed accompanied by potato chips stacked vertically in the ice cream.  The homemade chips had good grains of salt on them which countered the ice cream beautifully.\u000a\u000aService was good. Our server and I talked about Little Finland in the Gold Butte area of Nevada and we talked about going there with/without 4 wheel drive.  He was a pleasant server!\u000a\u000aI enjoyed the lunch and the day was so beautiful with temperatures nearing 80.  At the end of lunch, the sun on my back became almost too warm and we made a retreat through the restaurant to our respective cars.

V*** Review is for Spring 2013 Restaurant Week menu ***\u000a\u000aI didn't know SHe by Morton's existed until I saw it on the Restaurant Week list.  SInce I've eaten at most places in Aria and have yet to try more than Mastro's in Crystals, I put this on my list for restaurant week.\u000a\u000aCourse 1:  I started with a Caesar salad.  It was quite a large serving.  It had just the right amount of dressing and the croutons were flat pieces of crusty, toasted bread almost like little Melba toast rounds.\u000a\u000aCourse 2:  I ordered the marinated skirt steak extra rare.  When the steak came out, it was a 6 ounce filet they were substituting.  It had an excellent char and was bright pink rather than being the red it should have been.\u000a\u000aCourse 3:  For this course, you have a choice of one side.  I chose the wild mushrooms.  They were excellent and there was a large amount.  If two people were dining, two of these sides would be more than enough to share.  It would have been nice if I could have gotten half portions of two sides, but I understand the need for conformity.\u000a\u000aCourse 4:  I went with the Shesecake.  On their menu, it has this description:  Cream Cheese Bavarian, Champagne Strawberries.  There was a sprig of lavender on the top and some graham cracker crumbles on the side besides the graham crust.  The Shesecake was very, very good.  It was not like any cheesecake I had before.  I'm glad I read Heather's review before I went.  Because she stated the cinnamon twists were blah, I had to go with the Shesecake.\u000a\u000aService was excellent.  Before being taken to your table, your asked to sit at the bar while the table is readied.  It's actually a way of forcing you to buy a drink.  I got a diet Coke and took that to the table with me.  During the meal, my server came around and asked if it was regular or diet.  With 1/3 of a glass to go, he still removed that and gave me a fresh drink.  He then brought me a small plate with sliced lemon wedges for the soda.  \u000a\u000aHe was around several times.  After each course was delivered, he checked to make sure everything was OK.  The staff was very on top of the restaurant during the time I was there, and they really move.\u000a\u000aI almost opted for patio seating, but I decided to eat indoors to see the interior as this was my first visit.  I'm glad I did.  I still had a chance to watch tourists walk by outside the windows, and I had a good view of part of the Aria Hotel.  \u000a\u000aI am pleased that SHe by Morton's participated in Restaurant Week and I'll be returning to try some of their seafood offerings.  The menu is tempting!

VWe held our bi-monthly Yelp Book Club meeting at Midtown last night and I was quite impressed.  It's a small place.  It's very nicely designed and very classy looking.  The bar runs along the west side of the room and on the east side, there's a run of booth seats.  There are tables by the booth seats and there are very comfortable stools to sit at the tables.\u000a\u000aI had eaten at home and all I wanted was a diet Coke.  The barkeep last night was a very delightful young woman with a tremendous smile and a very welcoming demeanor.  She got my Coke and then some of the members of the group started to arrive.\u000a\u000aWhile I was there, one of the partners in this new business came by and introduced himself and the executive chef stopped by to talk about the menu.  Everyone was very polite, friendly, and accommodating.  It was a pleasant place for us to discuss our book and for those that had food, they enjoyed what they had.  I have uploaded a photo of some meatballs one of the members ordered.  They have a meatball sandwich, but all she wanted was a few meatballs--no bread, no cheese, just the meatballs.  The plate shows how well they complied with her special request.\u000a\u000aI'll be back.  I have to try their lobster pizza.  I was disappointed no one wanted to order one to share last night.

VI've read the reviews of Fat Choy my friends have posted and I knew this was a must try and I'm glad I did.\u000a\u000aFirst of all, my server, Jenny, was an absolute delight.  She asked me about being there before and if I had any questions about the menu.  She was very helpful and very personable.  I was the only customer on this slow Sunday evening, and she had extra time and she spent it checking back with me a chatting.\u000a\u000aI had looked at the menu online and I opted to try the bao.  I've never had Vietnamese bun bao so this was a new experience.  I ordered the duck and pork belly bao.  The duck bao comes with thinly sliced cucumber pieces, scallion, micro greens, and hoisin sauce.  The pork belly bao comes with one side of the pork seared, pickled mustard greens, cilantro, hoisin sauce, and some crushed peanuts.\u000a\u000aThe sandwiches were great!  The duck was my favorite because I simply love duck.  Jenny had brought me Sriracha and a small plate for putting the Sriracha and then using the plate as a dipping area.  It worked quite well!  The bun was very tasty.\u000a\u000aThen the option came for dessert.  What's a person to do?  Ask Jenny for advice and certainly follow it.  I got the peanut butter cup which has a chocolate cookie-like bottom, then a layer of peanut butter mousse (my words), topped by some bits of crispy pieces.  I got it à la mode with vanilla ice cream.  The peanut butter is excellent.  Soft, creamy, and very rich!  I'm a fan--big time!\u000a\u000aThe restaurant uses the app Wallet so you can pay without pulling out the plastic and they'll email you a receipt if you want.  \u000a\u000aThe only drawback for me was the smell of smoke.  The restaurant is open to this small, locals casino and there's a smell of stale smoke as soon as you come in the door from the outside.  This permeates the restaurant and detracts from the overall experience.  I wish they'd put up some doors after scrubbing the place down and trying to get rid of the smoke smell.  But, I will be back.  Even though it's a small menu, there are things to try!

V*** Review is for casino and garage only***\u000a\u000aI went to the Quad last night, November 22, to see the Headliners 2013 in the Q Theatre.  First, with the construction of the Big Wheel and Project Linq, finding a way in can be a challenge. Once I got to the garage, there was a large stream of water flowing through from just two days on light but continual rain.  Imagine if it had been a sudden thunderstorm.  This parking garage, aside from the constant flooding, is a joke.  Even on the first level up, there was a large amount of standing water.\u000a\u000aOnce I got into the casino, I saw that they have redone some of it quite nicely.  There is still a large sectioned off area where renovation continues as it changes from the Imperial Palace to the Quad.  There's nice new carpeting and new tile in the casino area.  \u000a\u000aThe showroom is the same as it always has been.  There are just some new signs with the new red lettering and fonts.\u000a\u000aWhile the place has been gussied up some, this is still not a casino that would be a destination for me.  For a show, I'll come here.  Other than that, no.

VI bought a Groupon for Johnny Rockets and it's about to expire so we stopped here on the way home from a show to use it.  My wife ordered the BBQ chicken bacon melt and I got the Philly Cheese Steak with peppers and mushrooms.  Both came with unlimited french fries.  We also got two large fries.\u000a\u000aThe sandwiches were OK.  Nothing exceptional nor were they less than anywhere else.  The fries were not salted after frying and they were dry and didn't hold salt once we got them.  Aside from that, it is a fast food court with a pizza shop and the staff went between the two as needed.  You place your order, are given a buzzer, and you get your tray when the buzzer goes off.\u000a\u000aThe sandwiches are overpriced.  Perhaps they're covering themselves from people who take advantage of the unlimited fries.  The service was slow.  There was one person ahead of us and we waited about 5 minutes for fast food.  Not good.  In addition, there are no plastic forks or knives available without asking.  I had to ask for artificial sweetener for the iced teas.  I could pay the same amount I paid tonight at many other sit down restaurants where I have servers bring my food in a much more appealing atmosphere.\u000a\u000aIf you're a fan of Johnny Rockets and buy a Groupon, it's best for a person going alone.  Use the Groupon to almost pay your entire tab at about 1/2 price.  That would be about what it's worth.  Johnny, I met you once.  I won't be back.

VAfter my meet with friends, I walked a few doors down and went into the D Hotel and Casino to have dinner at the Andiamo Italian Steakhouse.\u000a\u000aThe room is very nicely done.  I was at one of two tables along a wall that sat two people.  A server came to me and started explaining the specials having told me that my waiter wasn't yet there.  As the first one was explaining the specials, my server appeared.  The first one continued and then they let me study the menu.  In the meantime, a runner brought my iced tea.\u000a\u000aI was set to have a steak but when I learned the pasta special for last night was orecchiette, that's what I ordered.  I ordered a small portion of calamari for an appetizer and I got a side of meatballs (2 small) with dinner.\u000a\u000aBread was brought to the table.  It was a nice selection of a cheese brea, salted bread sticks, and some crostini.  Instead of butter, Andiamo serves a very good eggplant caponata with olives for use on the bread bruschetta style.  \u000a\u000aThe calamari came quickly and it was a good sized plate even if it was a small order.  The marinara served with the calamari was quite good.\u000a\u000aThe orecchiette was fairly good.  It was a bit too al dente.  There were small cubes of meet and some peas in the orecchiette and the sauce was good.  It did need some salt.  The side of meatballs were good.  Again, the sauce was good.\u000a\u000aThe server pushed the dessert cart to my table and I went with a coconut cake.  There seemed to be a difference of opinion as to what it was.  My server said it was a lime, coconut cake and another server told the woman seated at the next table that it was Key lime pie.  Regardless, the fruit flavor was very light.  The coconut was the star.\u000a\u000aService was very good.  A new glass of iced tea was brought before I was finished with my first.

VI saw the show before when the national touring company came to the Smith Center.  The show tonight was on a bit smaller scale due to the smaller size of the stage.\u000a\u000aThe performers did their roles very well especially the guys who played Jerry lee Lewis and Carl Perkins.  Elvis and Johnny Cash looked and sounded who they were supposed to be but about halfway through the show I noticed that they weren't really playing their guitars.  They were doing a very convincing strumming, but their left hands never moved to form any chords.  They merely grasped the top of the fretboard near the nut and held on.  Very few times did they move any finger on that hand.  I guess they were cast for their ability to look and sound like Cash and Presley.  The man playing Perkins was the only "plugged in" player and he really did play his guitar.  The man playing Jerry Lee Lewis was excellent!  He left the touring company to stay on here and he's a very talented pianist!\u000a\u000aThe theatre has been redone since I was last there.  Instead of tables on all levels, the front section is theatre style seating.  The cheaper seats are the classic table with 6 chairs or whatever number there were.\u000a\u000aIn spite of my problems with the show's performers, the music is still very good and it's an hour and a half of remembering some songs I grew up with.

VI got a message from a member of the cast telling me I was wrong about my comments of the actors not playing their guitars.  The cast member told me it was not correct to state the men faked playing their guitars and let me know that all of the cast play their guitars.\u000a\u000aBecause of this new information, I would upgrade the show to four stars from my previous review.  It is a good show!

VFour of us met here last night for our Yelp Book Club meeting.  This was a very pleasant place to have the meeting.  We had a large table with comfortable chairs to hold our books and our drinks.  There were enough chairs and tables that we could have added more space if more readers had attended.\u000a\u000aThe only drawback was getting the drink I wanted which is an important thing.  I ordered an iced mocha and the young man behind the counter had this blank expression on his face of, "What?"  Eventually, he got the manager/owner(?) who was seated with some people with whom it appeared he was discussing business.\u000a\u000aMy drink was eventually ready and it was tasty.  A bit more pricey than some competitors, but good nonetheless.  The same routine played out during the evening as more people came in.  An order was placed, a blank look ensued, and the manager had to come over and help with getting the drink done.  It was a hoot!\u000a\u000aI would have given this only 2 stars but it was such a good spot for our meeting that I award the extra star.  I may stop by again because the sandwiches on their menu board looked good and it is probably a great lunch stop.

VI had the good fortune to try some of Weeziana's gumbo when I was at Campus Commons for our CMYE Reverse Spring Break.  At that time, I got a container of chicken gumbo to take home (my wife won't do seafood).  \u000a\u000aYesterday, in a funk about what to do for dinner, I thought it was time to go back to the Commons and get some more gumbo.  I got a container of chicken (for my wife) and a container of seafood gumbo (for me).  \u000a\u000aTheir gumbo has a rich flavor with just enough of a spice to give it some good taste.  I don't use hot sauce with their gumbo because I want to taste the great gumbo flavor.  The seafood gumbo had a fair amount of seafood and it was a great meal that I brought home.\u000a\u000aThis is now a fast food place to go when I want something different and tasty.  Service was excellent!  I am a fan!

VI came here to see Carmen 3D, the Royal Opera House's production of the opera.  This was the third time I've been to Rave.  I was blown away!\u000a\u000aThe sound was excellent!  The theatre was small - capacity rated at under 300 (I don't remember the exact number), and the stadium seating is pitched so nicely that any seat would have a great line of sight to the screen.  The Real D 3D was superb!  The glasses were very comfortable and the pitch in the theatre made the depth perception much greater.\u000a\u000aThe legroom in the rows is amazing!  Lots of room to stretch out or let people go by.  The seats are comfortable.\u000a\u000aThe ticket seller was a delight!\u000a\u000aAll around, this is a great place to see 3D or 2D films.  I'll be back.

VI'm generally here two times a week before/after hikes.  The crew at this outlet are competent and friendly.  Sometimes, the line gets a little long, but it's not a major factor.\u000a\u000aThey used to have a really large seating area, but Albertson's recently redid some of their retail space and now that area is gone and is just a small area along the front wall.\u000a\u000aSitting on the patio is great.  It's always covered and the tables all have umbrellas.  Even in winter it's usually very pleasant to sit out and people watch.

VI had the day to do what I wanted and this was a place I had to see.  I've been missing it each month so today was the day!\u000a\u000aParking was easy in their lot.  I first took some photos of the monastery and grounds.  It's an interesting place.  Then it was on to the food.  Everything is written in the Thai language so you need to ask what things are.\u000a\u000aFirst things first--when you arrive at the food area, there's a very pleasant woman who takes your regular currency and gives you Thai coins.  I gave her $10 and she gave me a 5 Thai coin, 3 ones, and a 2 coin.  I had the five left over so I'm halfway to paying for my order for next month of the curry pumpkin pastries.\u000a\u000aI walked down the line looking at all the wonderful foods for sale.  I was looking more for something light that would be a breakfast replacement, in a manner, and I found it where they were making roti--a type of crèpe found in many cultures.  They were not making them from scratch--rather the roti were removed from a bag and placed on the griddle to brown.  After browning, they spread some sweetened condensed milk on the roti and then some confectioners' sugar.  A wholesome breakfast if I ever heard of one.  I also bought a container of sesame balls filled with taro for dessert tonight.  I also got a container of purple rice that comes with a side of coconut milk.  This is a sweet too!  You see why I was here, don't you.\u000a\u000aAs I was looking for a place to sit, I heard my name and saw Anthony M motioning me to come join their area.  There were a couple of Yelp people there and it was nice to sit in the winter sun and enjoy my roti.  Anthony explained about ordering pad Thai quickly when you arrive because there's a wait list for getting the dish it's so popular.  Another time.\u000a\u000aAnthony also let me try one of the coveted curry pumpkin pastries.  It was excellent!  You have to order them a month in advance!  I ordered two bags as I was leaving and I'll forgo bike riding that Sunday so I can come here at 9 AM when they open and claim my goodies.\u000a\u000aThis is a great place to go.  It's held once a month.

VI have been to this theatre for a number of years through the various names it's had.  The owner, Wassa Coulibaly, has a store in the front of the theatre where she sells the clothes she designs under her label Wassa Wear.  Coulibaly is a dancer with "Zumanity" the Cirque du Soleil show at New York New York.\u000a\u000aThe theatre seating is divided into three sections.  There are floor seats, theatre style seats, that are in front of the stage.  Behind these are raised seats that go up levels for good viewing.  There's a third seating area on the north side of the theatre like the rear seating.\u000a\u000aThere are a couple of shows running there on a regular basis.  One is Red Dress and the other is Tribal Night which is held the last Thursday of the month.  There are shows on other dates and it's good top check the website to see what may be playing.  There is a regularly scheduled Reggae night, too.\u000a\u000aThe theatre is perfect for the kind of shows done there.  If you're interested, there's a bar in the lobby that sells soda and alcoholic drinks.  \u000a\u000aAs mentioned by other reviewers, the entrance to the theatre is directly opposite the Yard House.  \u000a\u000aI was here last night to see Tribal Night 6 and I highly recommend the show!

VI've been to this casino a few times for shows at the Joint--both the old and new versions of the Joint.\u000a\u000aThis is not my go to place.  I don't fit their demographic at all.  However, it is nice to stop by here every now and then and watch the beautiful ladies as they head hither and yon.  There are some fine looking women.\u000a\u000aI stopped at the Hard Rock today to have breakfast at the Pink Taco.  I parked in the new garage and I saw how the casino was expanded when the new tower and garage were added.  It's not the small, circular casino it once was.\u000a\u000aI did take a few minutes to look at some of the rock memorabilia especially the Jimi Hendrix things near the doors to the garage.  \u000a\u000aIt's an OK place but it's not for me.

VThe Choreographers' Showcase, a joint production of Nevada Ballet Theatre and Cirque du Soleil, held its 6th annual show yesterday at the  Mystère Theatre.\u000a\u000aThe theatre is almost a complete semi-circle in shape and almost every seat in the house is a good one.  I wouldn't want to be on the extreme right or left for a show there but you still good see well.\u000a\u000aThe stage is very large and allows a program such as the Choreographers' Showcase to spread out and take advantage of the turntable front of the stage.  \u000a\u000aI have seen Mystère here several times and the place is great!

VWindows is a showroom created from a former meeting room on the second floor of Bally's past the Poker Room.  There are escalators and elevators to the second floor.\u000a\u000aI went to see a new production - "Divorce Party: Las Vegas" and this showroom is perfect for that kind of smaller production.  There were a couple hundred people there last night, and there were still some seats left.  Seating is divided into two "classes."  The non-VIP people sit in seats that form a somewhat U shape with all seats facing the stage.  Right along the edge of the stage, there is a row of round tables with the four seat setup which is common to many Las Vegas showrooms.\u000a\u000aThe staff at the showroom were quite quick at seating everyone who had been waiting in a long line in the hallway prior to the room's opening.  The cocktail waitress was around often so anyone wanting a drink could easily order from her or go to the bar themselves.\u000a\u000aI won't review the new show.  I put the photo of the set for the show here so you'd have an idea of what the showroom is like.

VI went to the Royal India Bistro for the lunch buffet today.  Lunch was very good and service was excellent. \u000a\u000aI was the first person here at about 11:30 but several tables were occupied before I left.  The server asked me for my drink order.  I got tap water which.  She then said they had a buffet and I replied that was the reason I was there.  She gestured for me to go ahead and start and she'd get my naan.\u000a\u000aThe buffet is small by comparison to other Indian buffets in town.  There are 8 hot dishes, some salad, and achaar.  It was a good enough choice and the good taste of the food made up for the limited selection.\u000a\u000aThe naan was buttered generously and was a welcome addition to the meal.\u000a\u000aFor my first trip, I got chicken tikka masala, malai kofta, and some basmati rice.  The thing I noticed about all of their dishes was they all had a nice spicy flavor.  It's not overpowering for people who like mild food but it had a definite tang and it was not just one dish but all of them.  It was the first time I know that I had malai kofta and it was really a treat!  The last thing was the vegetable pakora.  This was a bit disappointing.  I didn't read the full description because I know what it is.  The only vegetable I could see/taste was potato.  It seemed more like it was a pakora made from bread stuffing and some potato.\u000a\u000aFor the second plate, I had aloo matar, daal maharani, and curry chicken.  The aloo matar and curry chicken were good.  The daal was OK.  The sign said spicy lentils but this was the only dish that was lacking in spice.  There were some beans mixed in the daal, too.\u000a\u000aFor dessert I got some rice pudding and some carrot pudding.  The rice pudding was not labeled as kheer and it had a lot of liquid with less rice unlike kheer or rice puddings I've had before.  The carrot pudding, on the other hand, was very thick and unlike the carrot puddings I've had elsewhere.  Both puddings were very good--I'm not criticizing them but merely pointing out the different preparation.  I wish I had seen the achaar at the beginning of my meal.  I didn't think it would be as tasty with dessert!\u000a\u000aService as I said was very good.  When I went for my second plate, my dirty plate was removed and my water glass refilled.  The server was very pleasant.  The room is quite nice and it was very quiet.  \u000a\u000aThe price is just over $16 including tax.  For the limited selection, it's higher than most places.  Also, you have to park and walk your way through the casino to get there and it's right in the middle, halfway between either garage.\u000a\u000aStill, I won't hesitate to stop here and I think I'll try it for dinner some evening.

VWe stopped here yesterday for late lunch/early dinner.  Since it was Sunday, they had a brunch menu but neither of us were interested in that.  Immediately after being seated, we were asked about drinks and two iced teas were brought quickly.  \u000a\u000aAfter looking at the menu for awhile, my wife opted not to have the fajitas for two but ordered the chicken azado Vallarta style--salsa Española with capers, banana peppers, and olives.  I ordered the flaming fajitas.  After all, it's the name of the place and that's why I stopped.\u000a\u000aWe were brought chips, salsa, bean dip, and a small dish of grilled onions and one half of a grilled jalapeño.  Standard fare except for the grilled onions and jalapeño.  \u000a\u000aIn a short time, our dinners arrived.  Mine was flamed near the table but far enough away for safety.  The fajita pan is a high pan with a circular top.  The chicken, peppers, and onions were nicely grilled and the flavors were very good.\u000a\u000aMy wife's chicken was good, and it was a very large portion.  I have leftovers for dinner this evening.  It was one whole chicken breast.\u000a\u000aNot finishing her meal allows my wife to justify dessert.  I need no justification.  We shared an order of fried ice cream that was very good.  The crust on the outside was tasty and the ice cream was nice to have on one of our 100 degree summer days.\u000a\u000aService was excellent.  Multiple people came to check on iced tea refills, was it OK to remove dishes, anything else, etc.  One of the managers (owners?) came by and chatted and made sure all was well.  He asked if it was our first time at the restaurant.  He explained some of their current promotions.\u000a\u000aI normally would have given Juan's a 3 star rating.  However, the service and the appreciation shown for patronizing Juan's figured in my upping the review to 4 stars.  I appreciate when businesses give good service and are glad that you stopped there given all the choices we have in this city.  I am a fan!

VThis show has a lot going for it.  I was a bit taken back by some of the less than stellar reviews, but I found the show much to my liking.  Here are my positives:\u000a\u000aThe show moves along quite nicely.  The 12 month calendar idea is a take off on the Playmate of the Month.  After all, Claire Sinclair was the Playmate of the Year in 2011.  What I thought was well done from a theatrical point of view was the ease of transition for the most part from one scene to the other.  There were distractors that took your attention away from the stage so the crew could move into place the next scenes set pieces.  For example, some members of the band came down front and played--damn well, I might say!  When they were done, the stage lights came up and we were ready for the next scene.  Thoughtfully planned transitions like that work and there's no "down time" between scenes.\u000a\u000aThe band.  Well, what more can be said.  There are 6 members and they rock the house.  There are three horn players, two guitars players, and a drummer.  Boy are they ever good!  They're almost scene stealer sometimes.\u000a\u000aThen there are the dancers--5 of them--four women and one man.  They are all very talented and have good moves.  The ladies are dressed scantily enough to be sexy but this is not a topless show.  If that's what you're expecting, go across the street to Olympic Gardens and see all the tits you want.  \u000a\u000aClaire Sinclair, a name I hadn't heard until this show came about, acts as a narrator for the show.  Based on the earlier reviews, her speaking role has diminished.  She did some talking about where the idea came from for the show but she didn't overdo anything nor did she hog time.  Periodically, she'd do some dancing, most notably behind a translucent scrim, and she removed a top and tossed it aside.  When the scrim was removed, it left Claire clothed in a little less clothing albeit still covered.  She's there for her fame (notoriety) and she certainly has the body to please any eye gazing her way.\u000a\u000aMy favorite months were March, May, and September.  Without giving too much away, the March dance was to the song "Come Fly With Me" and the sole dancer was a flight attendant.  Really well done and choreographed well to the music.  May was a solo dancer again with the drummer near her and he'd rap the sticks on the platform on which she was standing and she'd tap dance a reply.  His stick work was amazing and her dancing was excellent.  Finally, the September theme, another solo dance, was the girl as a baseball player.  She could bend over the plate so provocatively.  It was great!  In between, there was a scene with Claire on a bed with some moving pillows.  Enough said, go and see the show to see for yourself.\u000a\u000aIt seems like there have been changes made to the show during the preview period and even since the official premiere last week.  It seems to be a polished show and I enjoyed my evening.\u000a\u000aFinally, the theatre is a pleasant place with comfortable seating.  While I could see well, I wasn't close enough to see as well as I wanted to.  Oh, there's always a next time and a reason to go again!

VAfter reading Nelson's review, I had to try this place.  It is hiding in plain sight.  I can't believe the number of times I've passed on the freeway and saw that large open shopping plaza, much of it empty, and little did I know there was a gem of a restaurant right in my line of sight.\u000a\u000aI stopped here after a "Showgirls of Las Vegas" program at the Nevada State Museum.  I was the only customer at 5:10 and remained the only customer for the hour I was there.  It's a shame.  They should have more business.\u000a\u000aI got the chips and salsa and I asked for the hot salsa.  That salsa with habanero peppers is quite good.  The mild salsa is fine, too, and I liked the small bits of avocado in the mild salsa.\u000a\u000aThe woman brought me a bowl of complimentary soup. It was not the vegetable soup shown in other photos for Chicken Itza but rather a noodle soup--fideo soup.  It was very good and very hot!!  Let it cool for awhile so you don't burn your lips, tongue, throat, and anything else to which this may come in contact!\u000a\u000aFor dinner, I ordered the panuchos.  Since there are three to an order, I got one, chicken, one turkey, and one pork (cochinita pibil).  All three were excellent!  The split tortilla filled with refried black beans with the tasty meat and toppings were super!! The meats were very juicy and this was a more than one napkin experience.  The meat could have been a bit hotter, but it didn't detract from the flavors.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I had arroz con leche which was not complimentary.  It is really, really, good!  It had a nice amount of cinnamon, raisins, and bananas and there seemed to be some pieces of crust as if the rice and milk were baked in a pie crust of some kind.\u000a\u000aThe horchata was very good. \u000a\u000aI'm coming back to try their other Mayan (Yucatan) specialties!  It is so wonderful to live in such a diverse city with all these different foods from which to choose.

VI had a comp ticket to see this show last night and I'm glad I went.  It was a very good show and I learned something about some of the rock music that I didn't follow.  While I liked the entire show, my favorite part was the early numbers--The Doors, The Who and the Rolling Stones.  When the Woodstock era ended and we sadly put away our bell bottoms, I took a different musical direction.  While I knew many of the songs when I heard them, I could no more identify the name of the song nor the band if Raiding the Rock Vault had not projected the names onto the large screens on stage and on the wings of the theatre.\u000a\u000aMy email about my ticket advised me that the show was LOUD! (sic).  I took a pair of ear plugs with me just in case, and while the show was loud, it didn't blow me away nor did anyone near me mind the loudness.  To me, it was a standard concert loudness.\u000a\u000aPeriodically, the screens would display historic information about the group or song that was being sung.  I found this very helpful because I learned as I listened.  Most of the people in the audience were younger than me and most knew almost every word to every song.  I was lucky if I could understand the words they were singing let alone know them to sing with the band.  \u000a\u000aI have nothing but good things to say about the quality of the playing and singing.  The band is fantastic.  There's a small story to get the show started--a little goofy--but it serves its purpose and I liked it.  As the show goes along, there are periodic pauses when some of the group does some speaking parts/skits on the sides of the stage.  It's a bit corny, but it too is OK.  It moves the show along from one era to another.\u000a\u000aI single out for special attention Tracii Guns and Howard Leese on guitar.  Wow are they good!  The box office person gave me a great seat, the 4th row center, but part of the center section begins with the 3rd row because they've built a ramp for the performers to stand when featuring them.  It was a great seat (see my photos).  As for vocals, the two I enjoyed the most were Andrew Freeman and Robin McAuley.  John Payne, a singer and the producer, was also very good.  \u000a\u000aThe lighting for the show was very well done and the laser light effects were quite good!  And a word about the LVH Theatre.  Since I was there the last time, they have redone the room.  The old wooden seats are gone and have been replaced with newer seats with cushioning.  They're fairly comfortable.  Also, as stated above, they've built out the front, center of the stage and if you're lucky to get a ticket in that area, you have a great view of the performers up close.  Regardless, the venue has 4 large screens that display the action so anyone can see well.  Since you're here for the music, you really don't have to see them that up close either.\u000a\u000aI recommend this show very highly especially if you're a fan of rock music of the 70s and 80s.  I think it's a bit long at exactly two hours, but it certainly is an entertaining two hours with very talented musicians.  \u000a\u000aAfter seeing this show at the historic LVH Showroom, you know that Elvis has left the building.  And so has Manilow.

VI saw Esteban once before at the Suncoast and I had the chance to see him again this week.  Performing with his daughter--who plays the violin and also a few percussion instruments--the two make a great duo.\u000a\u000aThe show, Music From the Heart, is a group of love songs for the most part.  Besame Mucho, the love theme from the movie "Romeo and Juliet," And I Love Her and the list goes on.  There tends to be a formula to the songs.  Esteban starts slow with his playing and is later joined by his daughter.  Sometime during the song, the two up tempo the number and really give their strings a workout.  Then, the temps slows and the song comes to a quiet and unhurried end.\u000a\u000aThe show is just about an hour and a half in the Shimmer Showroom at the LVH.  It's an intimate venue and there are no bad seats.  The show is good enough that I'm going again with a friend from out of town next week.  They are good!

VWe had our Yelp Book Club meeting in the great room of the Center last night.  This was my first time here and I needed my iPhone to guide me to the Center.\u000a\u000aI got a vanilla blended drink with a hot of espresso.  Quite tasty and very refreshing.  Had I looked at the menu more closely, I would have gotten an iced chai tea latte.  Oh well, if I'm in the area for some reason, I'll stop and get one of the sandwiches people rave about and the chai tea.\u000a\u000aThe Great Room was a good place for the book club discussion.  Our number was small--2--but Paolo and I had a good chat about the book "Fresh Off the Boat."  There are a good number of tables, the seating is quite comfortable, and it was a fairly quiet place until just before we left when there were a number of kids around and the computers behind us were all being used.\u000a\u000aIt's a very busy place with a lot going on at the Center.

VI stopped here for a light lunch.  I thought I'd order something from the "pickings" section of the menu.  I ordered the garbage fries.  They were very good, lots of peppers and sliced jalapeños, cheese, tomatoes, and sour cream.  \u000a\u000aService was good from the servers but not from the kitchen.  It took forever to get the fries--at least 15 minutes.  People who came in after me had sandwiches and fries much sooner than I got mine.\u000a\u000aIf it were not for the patio eating, this would be a 2 star review, but it's worth a star to watch the tourists go by.  I saw a guy approach a woman and buy her 7 Up scarf for $60.  Tourists.  Amazing!\u000a\u000aI don't think I'll return.  It's just not worth it even with the sales you see.

V***This review is for the casino only***\u000a\u000aAfter dinner on Fremont Street, I walked down 3rd Street to check out the newly opened Downtown Grand Hotel and Casino.  It's such a pleasure to see the downtown area coming alive again.\u000a\u000aI decided to get a slot club card and the line went quickly.  The place is really nice and has that new look and smell from the new carpeting.  All the slot machines are also new.\u000a\u000aIt's a small casino.  I really can't remember much of the Lady Luck which used to be here as it closed so many years ago.\u000a\u000aI did a walking tour of the casino and dining areas and it's all very pleasant.  I played for awhile and came away up $3.  Wow, big spender--major winner!\u000a\u000aThe area is dark and the only sign is one neon sign which says casino.  The place isn't ablaze with lights.  \u000a\u000aI hope to be back soon and try Stewart and Ogden.  It looked very inviting!

VOne of the benefits of living in Las Vegas is the large amount of talent and opportunity to see shows.  Raack N Roll is a newer topless revue that moved from Hooters to the D.  \u000a\u000aThe show is opened by Robert Nash, a look and sound alike for Robert De Niro.   He provides some comedy relief, and quiet, throughout the show.  He's quite good at what he does.  As with all impersonators, he's much better with some than others.  Of course he does De Niro well.  His Marlon Brando is a little off but funny nonetheless.\u000a\u000aNow to the reason why I came to the show.  This is a topless revue and it's well done.  The ladies are quite attractive and their dancing is pretty good.  The big problem with the show is the venue.  The D has spent a lot of money renovating the property since they purchased it.  The showroom has a new entrance, but the room itself remains pretty much unchanged.  That means there's a low stage, perhaps 2 feet raised from the floor.  When the ladies are doing some moves that have them low on the stage, it's difficult to see what they're doing.  If you really want to see them without anyone in your way, get there early and hope for front seats.\u000a\u000aThe music is loud--too loud, I think--basically hard rock.  Of course, I'm not the demographic to which they're appealing. The younger folks in the audience last night seemed to be moving with the beat.\u000a\u000aA couple of my favorite scenes--the woman on the swing to "Feelin' Good", the mini-bondage scene, and of course the classroom scene where an audience member--male--gets to join in the "fun" at school.\u000a\u000aA few changes to the show and a higher stage would earn this revue one more star.

VWhat a pleasure!  Three excellent performers and one of the best piano players there is join forces to showcase their fine voices and show us why they've been on Broadway and on national tours of some of the biggest musicals there are--Phantom of the Opera and Les Misérables.  \u000a\u000aThis show opened last year, closed for awhile when the Plaza had a dispute with a promoter of two other shows at the Plaza, and then reopened after that promoter's things were removed from the showroom.  The Phat Pack name comes from the fact that the three singers met while doing Phantom, the Las Vegas Spectacular and it's a play on words with the Rat Pack.  When Phantom closed, they decided to do this show and I'm glad they did.\u000a\u000aGenerally, it's three men, Randal Keith, Ted Keegan, and Bruce Ewing.  Ewing is out of town for awhile and they have gotten Rebecca Spencer, the original Madame Giry from Phantom, the Las Vegas Spectacular.  She filled in quite well.\u000a\u000aThe show revolves around the three singing together and in solo mode.  They tell some things about their lives and how they became entertainers.  Keegan did a superb Danny Boy along with some other songs including a very haunting I'll Be Seeing You by Cole Porter.  Keith's standout numbers were Bring Him Home from Les Mis and Is Anybody There from 1776.  The two sang a song written by a local composer called Men of a Certain Age which is quite funny and hits close to home for me.  Spencer's voice was very good and she was an able stand in for Bruce Ewing.\u000a\u000aThe three were accompanied by Philip Fortenberry, a very talented pianist that Las Vegas is lucky to have reside here.  He is superb!  He did a number that Liberace composed that's a great variation of Chopsticks.  If you saw the HBO movie "Behind the Candelabra" about Liberace, you saw Fortenberry's hands and sometimes his body playing the piano.  \u000a\u000aThis show is about 70 minutes in length and it is a gem.  I hope more people get out and see this show.  We are fortunate to have these talented people in this great city!

VI was going to stop in the northwest on my jaunt back from Indian Springs to get some cupcakes, but the place I was going is closed for a week.  A quick search of Yelp and Lulu's it was!  The fact that I had Nelson and Jade's reviews to guide me was a big help.  But, I was here for dessert to bring home.  Another day for breakfast or lunch.\u000a\u000aI passed the place the first time I went by because it faces the street from a high perch and all I noticed was the new Metro Pizza next door.  Had I looked at the photos as well as the reviews before I went, I would have gone right into Lulu's parking lot.\u000a\u000aI walked in and was greeted by a really pleasant young lady.  She let me look as long as I wanted to find the perfect dessert for my wife and me.  I ended up getting the cannoli cupcake for myself and a chocolate brownie for my wife that had a rocky road type of topping.  She divided hers into three pieces for three nights.  I finished my cupcake after dinner.  \u000a\u000aThe cupcake was angel food and the chocolate cannoli was stuck into the top of the cupcake.  The cannoli was good with a mildly sweet filling with some nice pieces of pistachio.  The angel food cake was heavenly, no pun intended.  Very tasty!  Andrea liked her brownie although she had a bit of a hard time with the nut, chocolate, and marshmallow topping.  This is right off the 95.  I can see stopping here more often after hiking.  We need to replace the calories we burned off, no?\u000a\u000aLulu, you deserve your four stars!

VI went here last night before seeing Kà.  I had read some of the Yelp reviews of good friends and I knew exactly what I would order.  When the time came, I changed my mind and I ordered two things differently than I had planned.\u000a\u000aI started with the lobster corn dogs which were accompanied by a container of crème fraîche flavored with whole grained mustard.  I have never had a regular corn dog--ever-- so this was a treat in more ways than one.  The lobster was very flavorful, the coating was a nice soft texture, and the mustard sauce made the combination a winner.\u000a\u000aNext I got the peanut butter crunch burger.  It's a large burger, I'm figuring 8 ounces before cooking, served on a bed of fries.  The burger is topped with peanut butter and some bacon jam.  There are also a number of ribbed potato chips on top and it gives a nice crunchiness to the burger.  I asked for it rare and that's the way I got it.  The fries were crispy but there were way too many.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I tried one of their cakes 'n shakes pairings.  I got the roasted peach and almond buckle that comes with a salted caramel shake and a small container of bourbon toffee to pour into the buckle like you would flavoring into a soufflé.  It was very good but the salted caramel shake which was very thick needed more salt.  I didn't taste any salt at all.\u000a\u000aService was excellent for most part.  It took quite awhile to get my check because it seemed like everyone was getting ready to leave at the same time.  Until then everything was good.  I was brought a new iced tea before my other one was finished, there was a clean fork brought between the corn dogs and the burger--in short--the kind of attention you get from higher end restaurants and not generally associated with a gastropubs.  \u000a\u000aI really liked my time at the pub and I found it a great place for a person eating alone.  There was a TV near where I was sitting.  I enjoyed watching the Washington Nationals game.  The place is loud and it would be hard to have a decent conversation but people were.

VI am a fan for sure.  This was my first time having shaved ice and it was wonderful and refreshing on this 100+ degree evening.  I got the black sesame with mochi and a drizzle of sweetened condensed milk.  Great!\u000a\u000aI'm glad they're going to be at the Telus parking lot for the foreseeable future every Wednesday from 3 to 10 PM.  I'll be back to try some of the other flavors and enjoy the chill it gives me on our warm summer days!\u000a\u000aThere is a 30 cent charge if you pay with a credit or debit card instead of cash.  That's not a bad charge considering what some others sometimes charge.

VI have been conflicted since I saw the show last evening about how to grade it.  I have been between three and four stars.  I'm not completely a fan of the show, so I'll give it 3 stars for Cirque's pushing the envelope with its technology.\u000a\u000aI think you will appreciate the show more if you know Jackson's music--I don't for the most part except the biggest hits and mine might not be the same as anyone else's.  \u000a\u000aWhen you enter the theatre, there are two threads that come into play--one, the constant write ups about Jackson in tabloids and the ceaseless hounding by paparazzi for him more than many entertainers.  The funny faux headlines in these tabloids are fun to read.  My favorite: "Man invents his own language - Can only speak to himself."  That shows the idiocy to which some of the tabloids went in creating incredulous stories about Jackson to sell papers.  The other part is the paparazzi, a group of five or six guys going around the theatre taking photos of audience members with one carrying a boom mike.  Another part of Jackson's, or any well known entertainer's life in the media world.  The projection on the scrim was a nice touch also.\u000a\u000aThe show started and there were a few of Jackson's songs with a bit of Cirque circus stuff.  When the songs ended, the Jackson fans in the audience cheered loudly.  Many of the people around me just sat there and didn't applaud.  It was a strange feeling that I can't quite describe.  Something along the lines of, "Oh, OK, that song's over.\u000a\u000aDuring the show there is a small amount of circus acts--the trampoline guys and the people climbing and doing tricks on fixed poles rather than the silks that Cirque is so known for.  My feeling was that they should have just left this out.  It really doesn't fit the songs and there's really no purpose except to remind you that you're at a Cirque show.  I wish they had focused completely on the technology and maybe even done more with that.  There is a lot of good music and dancing.  I recognized many of the songs but I wasn't there as a fan of Jackson but a fan of Cirque du Soleil and live entertainment.\u000a\u000aThe hologram sequence near the end was marvelous.  I think more could have been done with this throughout the show.  Not each number, but more of it.  Push the technology as far as you can and leave the trampolines out.\u000a\u000aFinally, I learned for sure that the man in the moon is a lady.  Now you'll have to go to see the show to know what I mean.  Theatre goers who know Broadway and see this show will get my double reference in that sentence.  \u000a\u000aThis is a solid show but needs some tightening.  And, please, have some of the song "Will You Be There" sung instead of spoken!

VNelson, thank you for finding this great little place.  I had this bookmarked for a few months and today I gave it a go.  It has to be all 5 stars.\u000a\u000aThe menu at Skinnyfats is divided into Happy Eats and Healthy Eats.  So of course I looked immediately at the happy side, skipping the healthy side, and I ordered their Bonjour Brulée, which the menu describes as "9 grain bread dipped in our egg white signature crème brulée mixture, pan fried and drizzled with agave nectar."  It comes with three slices of applewood smoked bacon.  There was no whipped cream as Nelson had, but it really is not needed.\u000a\u000aYou order at the counter, sit anywhere, and then one of the nicest young women brings your coffee or other drink and food to your table.  The French toast was wonderful. The agave syrup was only needed a tiny bit, and the fresh berries were the perfect topping.  The coffee was good.\u000a\u000aWhile waiting, I took a bunch of photos and just enjoyed the place.  Whoever came up with the theme and the decorations was very creative and imaginative.  I want to use the word cute, but I don't like using the word cute in general.\u000a\u000aThis is an out of the way place but I can see where they would do a good business from all the businesses in the area.  I wlll be back.  This is a place to try over.  Lunch next time!  This is a place to bring out of town guests for breakfast.  They'll love it.\u000a\u000aNota bene:  Follow Nelson's directions and look at his photos and you'll get right to Skinnyfats straight away!

VI had breakfast here this morning and I didn't want to have a large breakfast.  I ordered the Anaheim taco which consists of Anaheim chilies, sour cream, sautéed onions, a blend of three cheeses, a slice of avocado all placed on a taco with scrambled egg.\u000a\u000aThe taco was not a flour one.  It was more like a pastry crust rather than a flour tortilla, but it was very good.  The menu says that all breakfast tacos are served with potatoes or refried beans and rice.  I was offered neither.  I did have a choice of mild, medium, or hot for the salsa and I chose hot.  It's mildly hot if that's not an oxymoron.\u000aBreakfast was good and the server refilled my coffee when he saw I was getting low.\u000a\u000aThis place just opened a month ago and they're still doing work on it.  This morning, they were installing a garage door in the bar area that can be raised in good weather and serve from a counter on which the door rested today.\u000a\u000aPart of the fun of eating here today was watching my server change the Coke cartridges.  The syrup now comes in super concentrated containers that look like copy machine cartridges and it was interesting watching him switch out two of the cartridges. The change in technology was interesting.\u000a\u000aI parked underground in the Neonopolis garage and there was no charge.  I don't know if it's because of the time of day or that I was there less than an hour, but this is the second time that the cashier at the pay station just wished me a good day and opened the gate.\u000a\u000aNacho Daddy is worth a return visit when they get the kinks worked out. And gentlemen, aim for a field goal!

VI had an appointment this morning and decided to go somewhere for breakfast after.  A bit of searching on Yelp helped me decide to go with the Gold Spike Grill.  I've been reading about the changes here since it was purchased by the Downtown Project.  Wow, what a nice place!  What a nice surprise!!\u000a\u000aThe place is small so I didn't have to search to find the Grill.  It's a bright, almost all white area on the east side of the building.  I opted to sit at the counter.  As I walked through the lobby area, I noticed all the people with their laptops and I soon checked my iPhone for wifi.  Free, fast wifi!  Yes!\u000a\u000aThe menu isn't very large for breakfast but it's certainly adequate.  As I was looking at the menu, my server, Brittany, brought me coffee and a glass of ice water.  I ordered their 3 egg omelette with any three ingredients you choose from their list.  I got spinach, jalapeño, and cheese.  The omelette comes with hash browns and toast of your choice.  As I was enjoying the wifi and taking photos of the Grill, I noticed the hot sauces that were on the counter.  They have a whole bunch of kinds most of which I've never heard of before.  \u000a\u000aWhen my omelette arrived, I chose to put some "Scorned Woman" hot sauce on part of it.  The bottle had a heat level of 8 on it.  I don't know who judges the heat of a hot sauce, but 8 was a bit too high.  But, it was hot and it was a good addition to the omelette.\u000a\u000aService was good and sitting at the counter, one of the cooks looked out after I was eating for awhile and asked how breakfast was.  When I gave him thumbs up, he had a big smile and went back to his work!  This was something I noted from everyone at the Gold Spike.  People had smiles, they were very pleasant, and they were welcoming!\u000a\u000aWhen I left, I spent some time in the "back yard" which would be a great place to bring a drink or sit and spend some time chatting with friends.  There's also an area behind a fence where you can eat outdoors.\u000a\u000aParking is very convenient and free.  Enter from 4th Street between Ogden and Stewart as you head north on 4th.\u000a\u000aWhile the breakfast was nothing exotic, it gets all 5 stars.  This is as good as breakfast gets and the staff is so very pleasant.  Throw in the wifi and you have a great spot!

VThis is the former home of Cherry on Top Frozen Yogurt that closed months ago.  I've seen the sign that Dazzle Berry is coming soon and finally today it said they were now open.\u000a\u000aThe store is very nice.  Everything was very clean.  It looks like they took over the furniture from the previous shop as they are the same and the layout is the same.\u000a\u000aThere are 6 banks of machines with 2 flavors in each and the chance to do a twist flavor at each of the 6 machines.  The price is $.55 an ounce which puts it on the higher side of the frozen yogurt scale in the area.\u000a\u000aI tried a swirled flavor today.  My go to flavors when I'm trying a new place is Cake Batter and Red Velvet.  I swirled them an put some plain coconut and a few pieces of mochi.  The yogurt was very good.  Before I can give the place a higher rating, I need to go back and try the pistachio they have.  I can't say I've seen that flavor at other yogurt places.\u000a\u000aThe shop sells coffee and they also make waffles and you can get a warm waffle and put frozen yogurt on top.  Sounds intriguing.  On a 100+ degree day in Las Vegas, this little stop was a nice respite from throwing 240 pounds of softener salt into the car.\u000a\u000aI entered the website as it appeared on my receipt but it's wrong.  I Googled it and I got this:\u000a\u000ahttp://dazzleberryyogurt.com\u000a\u000aI'll be back.  It's going to be a long summer.

VI attended Tony T.'s UYE here last night and we enjoyed the food a lot.  We shared 7 main dishes and 5 shaved snow desserts.  The winning dish for me last night was the salt and pepper fried chicken.  The dish was salty and it was somewhat spicy from the cayenne like pepper sprinkled on the chicken pieces.  It was terrific.\u000a\u000aThe Taiwanese style sausage and minced pork with rice were very good.  In addition, the cuttlefish noodle soup was also very enjoyable. I had one of the spicy wontons and it was good but the spice level was low, not really very spicy.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, we had ordered 5 different kinds of snow ice and they brought each flavor to us one at a time which we then spooned into our dishes.  \u000a\u000aGoing with a group like this was perfect!  We got a chance to taste a lot of food.  Going alone or with another person would limit what you could try because the portions are large.  \u000a\u000aService was very good and the owners of the small restaurant were very accommodating.  Having Tony T. there was a big plus because he could explain some of the dishes to us and his conversant Chinese helped with the ordering process.\u000a\u000aI'll be returning.  I have to have my own order of salt and pepper chicken.

VI enjoyed Véronic's voice quite a lot but I just didn't know how well she was doing at impersonating many of the people she did because I had absolutely no idea of how they sound.\u000a\u000aThe 6 dancers add a little diversion during the show and the lighting is OK.  She has an adorable French Canadian accent.  I found myself closing my eyes and just listening to her voice which I say again is very good.\u000a\u000aWhile the hook for the show is it's name--Voices--not many celebrity singing impersonators go very far in show business.  Perhaps she should ditch her impersonations and let her voice stand on its own.  \u000a\u000aThe show lasted 90 minutes and was OK.  It also started 10 minutes late which is not OK.

VPriscilla is a funny, brassy, high energy musical filled with a lot of great songs, bright costumes, and a super cast!\u000a\u000aThe basic outline--a group of female impersonators travels from Sydney, Australia to Alice Springs in the center of the country.  Along the way, they have various incidents--some funny, some not funny at all!  The story is not deep.  It's just what it needs to be the move the show along.  The thing here is the music and the costumes.\u000a\u000aThis is a national tour show of Priscilla which was to be at the Venetian until the middle of September, but sadly, ticket sales have not been good and the show is ending July 22nd.  It's sad that a city the size of Las Vegas, the home of Frank Marino and the city where female impersonator Kenny Kerr brought this kind of entertainment to this city, is not supporting this show. So, if you want to see it, you'll have to go quickly.\u000a\u000aThe show is just about 2 hours in length, and it's goes by quickly.  You'll be amazed when you look at your watch after the show.  The cast is excellent and the staging is very well done.  And of course, the costumes are over the top.  You'll smile and laugh almost the entire show!\u000a\u000aOf the songs other reviewers have listed, none mentioned my favorite--MacArthur Park.  It's also one of the funniest dance routines in the entire show.  Locals, there's a 2 for 1 discount for the remainder of the shows.  Go see it!

VLast night was the grand opening festivities for this new place that has been open a few weeks.  There was a DJ, the Slidin' Thru truck, face painting, a Yelp table with costume ideas, and some games for the kids of all ages.\u000a\u000aOn to the reason I came.  I ordered their Nuts About Brownies shake, medium size that they call "mids."  This is one of the shakes they've designed although you can design your own.  Mine had blended brownies, Reese's, and peanut butter blended with milk.  The shake was very good but I shudder to think about the number of calories it had.  It could have used a bit more blending as the bottom ended with some large brownie pieces and some chunks of peanut butter.  All in all, it was OK.\u000a\u000aThey have a menu from which you can design your own shake.  Use caution because the price and the calories can add up.\u000a\u000aThis was another chance to get with some Yelp friends and enjoy some good conversation along with the refreshing drink.  I don't think I'll be a regular.  It's just too rich and sugary!

VI ride my bicycle through the park almost every Sunday and it's usually empty except for some people walking their dogs.   If there is no one out, I generally see rabbits who come from the desert to enjoy a breakfast buffet of the fine grass and plantings at the park.\u000a\u000aIt's a good sized park with lots of space for running with your pets--dogs and children--and there is a cushioned play area for the smaller kids with the requisite coverings so the sun is screened somewhat.\u000a\u000aThere's a section where you can play sand volleyball (the beach is too far away for beach volleyball).  There are covered picnic tables and clean bathrooms.  The park is well maintained.\u000a\u000aWe have stopped here after a hike or two for our snack and drink time but then read the Summerlin rules that alcohol is not allowed in the park.  \u000a\u000aIt would also be a nice place to sit and read but since it's in an area where the housing starts have really taken off, it will be a bit noisy during the day.\u000a\u000aIt's a typical Summerlin park and very nice.

VI came here last night with about 20 people from Yelp as the first stop on Nelson's UYE Taco Trek and Cool Down #2.\u000a\u000aI got two tacos, one cabeza with a hand made corn tortilla; the other was lengua with flour tortilla.  After stopping at the toppings bar on the side of the wagon, I enjoyed these tacos a lot.  I like the sliced cucumbers and their spicy hot green salsa.  It was very good.  On the lengua, I put some pineapple which made the flavor of the tongue stand out.\u000a\u000aI think this would be a place to which I'll return and get some tacos to go.  I find that eating at food trucks is problematic because you don't have a place to sit nor a table.  Of course, I could have gotten one of my folding chairs we use for after hike Guinness Time but today's not the best time to think of that.\u000a\u000aThis is a good street taco place and I recommend it if you're on the west side of Las Vegas!

VThere's no way I can write about RX Boiler Room without giving it the highest praise.  What a super spot and boy does it make it easy to have dinner with a fussy wife (did I say that?)\u000a\u000aLast night was KNPR night at Cirque's Michael Jackson One. m I looked at the menu and found that there was enough here for her to eat.  Eating tapas portions is great because you can try different things without getting something you're not particularly fond of.\u000a\u000aWe were quickly brought the iced teas we ordered and then we ordered the following from the Dips and Bites section of the menu:  For me--chicken liver pâté with a port wine jelly on top.  It was delicious and something I can enjoy because Andrea wouldn't even touch the glass if I paid her to do it, even double dared!  \u000a\u000aWe also got an order of Inside Out French Onion Grilled Cheese and an order of Chicken Pot Pie Nuggets.  The cheese sandwich has three kinds of cheese and the caramelized onions from onion soup in the sandwich.  The "soup" is a small metal container of the au jus from onion soup.  The Chicken Pot Pie bites are wonderful!  Small, deep fried tater tot shaped goodness with peas and carrots inside the nuggets.  Boy, were they good!  That about did it for normal food so it was on to dessert.\u000a\u000aAndrea got their Peach cobbler and our server warned her it wasn't a standard peach cobbler but had cinnamon ice cream with... At that point, Andrea stopped her and said, "I'll have that!"  Just say cinnamon and it will be good.  I ordered the greent tea panna cotta that had small bits of fruit and pieces of macadamia nuts on top.  It was also very, very good.\u000a\u000aNow about the service, Chef Moonen, whoever did the hiring and the training for your new restaurant deserves a raise!  Everyone, whether they were associated with our table or not, was king, polite, and had a pleasant smile and were very accommodating.  Our server, Alex, was a pure delight.  She knew the menu inside out, knew how to describe the food, recommended some things, and was a very efficient and pleasant server.  The runner who brought the food was also smiling and friendly.  \u000a\u000aWhen we were leaving, I saw an elevator and I asked if it was for use by the general public.  One of their staff said of course and called the elevator for us.  It saved a number of steps to the other side of the Mandalay Place Shops and we exited right outside the casino.  \u000a\u000aOne final mention about Alex.  She had on this red bustier type top and short shorts!  I almost asked her if I could take her photo, but that would have almost been an outrageous request for obvious reasons.  She was a delight, visually and professionally.  If you read this, Alex, let me know if it's OK for next time!  Chef Moonen, the person who hired should get a raise.  Hint, hint!\u000a\u000aI can't wait to go back and try some more of their goodies and I think I've sold my wife on tapas style dinners.

VFor my last review of 2013 what better than to review a desserts only restaurant?  \u000a\u000aI arrived at Sweets Raku at about 7 last night and I was the only customer for about 10 minutes.  I chose the prix fixe 3 course dessert menu along with a pot of peach tea.  I sat at the bar because I wanted to see the pastry chefs doing their thing up close.\u000a\u000aFor the three course prix fixe, you only have 1 choice--the second dessert.  The first, the amuse, and the last, the petit four, are fixed depending on the day and season.  For the first course last night, the amuse was an oval of mango sorbet with blue ice as Yuka, my server, described it to me.  It was mint jelly on the mango sorbet and it made a good pairing of flavors.\u000a\u000aCourse two I chose.  I had read the Yelp reviews and I was sure I'd go with the Mt. Fuji.  Yuka told me the Ringo (apple pie) was made that day and was excellent.  I finally decided on the Baton which was a tall thin chocolate mini-tower with chocolate and pistachio mousse and some fresh mango cubes.  It was excellent.  It was a little tricky to eat because I tried to peel a piece of the very thin chocolate tower to dip in the mousse but the tower is so fragile, it sometimes breaks away.  Regardless, it was tasty and lots of fun.\u000a\u000aCourse three, the petit four, was a delicious parmesan cheesecake with tangerine pieces.  The cheesecake was excellent.\u000a\u000aNone of the desserts was sweet which was very appealing.  It's not that I don't like sweet--it's just that it isn't needed in every dessert.  \u000a\u000aService was excellent!  Yuka was a gem. We did have a bit of a language problem but then I don't speak Japanese and she speaks English.  Do yourself and sit at the bar and watch the ladies work magic with preparing these delightful pastries!  \u000a\u000aFor those of you still trying to find the place when you arrive at the plaza, it's just south of Big Wong Restaurant.  Look for the wine rack through the glass windows.  At night, you won't see the spoon hanging outside.

VI was on my way home through Chinatown last night and decided to stop here for gas.  It's was only slightly higher than Costco prices and since it was later, it was an easy in and out.\u000a\u000aThey have a multi-point pay system.  Insert your card and then enter the pump you're using.  After pumping, you return to the pay area to get your receipt.  A painless process and at 10:15 not a crowded one.

VOne of the two best places to go for ice cream/gelato in Las Vegas.  This newer spot on Las Vegas Boulevard near the Stratosphere is just wonderful.\u000a\u000aWe came here for a sweet treat and we weren't disappointed.  I had the sweet corn and my wife had the pistachio gelato.  Both were very good.  There are several tables so you don't have to go back to your car to enjoy your frozen treat!\u000a\u000aThe woman who owns the place is just a delight.  She is so friendly and she wants to have you try almost every flavor she makes. The shop is clean and bright and welcoming.  There is a bathroom and it was kept nicely clean.  In addition to the gelato, she serves some baked goods and coffee and tea.\u000a\u000aThe parking is the only potential drawback.  During the day, it's probably more difficult to get a space here but I got one right in front of the sexy clothing women's store.  Viva Las Vegas!\u000a\u000aI'll be back to try the chocolate gelato with two peppers to give it some heat with the cold.

VWe decided to try Lucille's tonight with take out.  I did an online order this morning for pick up at 4:30 PM.  I was ten minutes early and it was ready yet which is good because it wasn't made ahead of time and sitting somewhere.  The online ordering was a big plus!!\u000a\u000aI got an original pulled pork sandwich with a side of mac and cheese.  My wife got the Cajun chicken sandwich with a side of garlic mashed.  One of the problems with what I got was simply the fact that it's take out.  I live nearby, but pulled pork isn't boiling hot when it's placed in the bun and therefore it wasn't a hot sandwich and in fact wasn't warm.  Luke warm would be closer to the temperature of the meat.  The mac and cheese stayed warm.  I thought the sandwich was dry even though the menu says it's tossed in their special sauce.  Maybe I should have asked for some BBQ sauce to go.  There was no toss that I could discern.  The mac and cheese was very good.  My wife liked her sandwich although she thought it was very spicy hot.  She liked the garlic mashed side.\u000a\u000aI guess I'm just not a BBQ person.  Nothing about BBQ blows my socks off.  If I came back to Lucille's, it would be for a dinner of mac and cheese.  I'll take international cuisines or a good steak before I'd get this.  There's one other BBQ place I need to try before I put a nail in my BBQ coffin and lower it in the ground.  The price/value just isn't there.  But, Lucille's is OK--Just.

VMy thoughts about Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak are about how good the appetizer was and how ordinary the rest of the meal was.\u000a\u000aI wanted to try one of the heritage steaks but when I didn't want the bone in 18 ounce ribeye--just too much food--and my server suggested I go with the regular ribeye, a smaller cut.  For a starter I ordered the charred octopus that's so highly recommended by the reviews.  For dessert, I had to try the S'mores Fritters.\u000a\u000aI was brought a bottle of still water in a Heritage Steak labeled bottle.  There was no charge for bottled water as I feared.  I also ordered an iced tea.  Both drinks were a bit slow in being brought but it was OK_I was in no hurry.  A runner also brought me a bread basked of two rolls and a small plate with a round of butter with cracked salt on half of the round.\u000a\u000aThe appetizer was superb!  The appetizer size was just right and the octopus was perfectly cooked.  It had a nice zing to it from the red peppers that were on top.  It was a grand way to start the meal.\u000a\u000aMy steak came next and I was taken aback by the way it looked.  Here was a nice piece of beef that had a glop of something on it.  As it turned out, it onion-balsamic relish and roasted onions, but it looked so odd.  I wondered who came up with this plating idea.  I had asked for the steak to be cooked blue.  The server asked if I wanted it charred on each side blue or just blue and not charred.  I wanted just blue.  It was cooked beyond this and it soon went to a medium rare rather than even rare.  \u000a\u000aFor dessert I had the S'mores fritters.  This was an OK dessert but there was nothing special about the deconstructed S'more.  It's a cute idea, but what it turns out to be are three doughnut hole-like chocolate rounds, several dots of marshmallow that are flamed brownish, and some gelato on Graham cracker crumbs.  The gelato was supposed to be Graham cracker flavor, but it really had little flavor of its own.  The taste of Graham came from the crumbs beneath the gelato.  \u000a\u000aService was generally very good.  Someone was around to refill my water glass with the bottled water and dirty plates were removed quickly.  The only hiccup was a wait for a second iced tea.\u000a\u000aI was underwhelmed by the meal.  It was OK and the appetizer was more than that.  It just wasn't up to the highest standards I would expect of this celebrity chef.\u000a\u000aEnd of review and beginning of side story:\u000a\u000aAfter I took a photo of something during the early part of my meal, I noticed a flash go off in my direction and a woman had snapped my photo with her iPhone.  She was with a party of four and she said she wanted a photo of someone really enjoying their job.\u000a\u000aLater when my meal was complete, she came over and sat across from me and asked if I was a food critic or a "Yelpie."  I proudly stated that I was a Yelpie.  She then went on to talk about the meal and ask my thoughts.  When I pretty much said what I wrote here, she talked about her steak which was supposed to medium rare came out raw.  She sent it back and the second one was correct.  I had noticed that she was eating while her husband and the other couple had finished and their plates were cleared.  She suggested that I try the Cowboy Steak at another restaurant, one very close to Heritage Steak.  The four of them thought it was a great steak.\u000a\u000aEnd of side story.

VLet me start by saying I'm not a fan and I doubt I will ever be back to Echo & Rig.  We came here late afternoon and there was one other party in the restaurant.  We were brought our iced tea quickly and it was refilled frequently while we were there.\u000a\u000aI had looked at the menu online and I took some time to decide once there.  For a starter, we ordered their portobello fries which were served with an herb aioli.  This was the first I noticed that anything that stated garlic or should have had garlic (herb aioli) had no garlic taste at all.  The herb aioli was good but missing the garlic flavor.\u000a\u000aMy wife ordered the tri-tip steak--medium--even though I suggested she get medium rare and I ordered the hanger steak blue.  She was drawn to the tri-tip because the menu said lemon and garlic neither of which was evident in any way.  Garlic fail number 2.  All their steaks come with garlic chips (no garlic flavor here either--garlic fail #3) and a mushroom Rockefeller, a breadcrumb stuffed mushroom cap.\u000a\u000aThe portobello mushroom was wonderful with the light coating and the cheese shreds.  Then we waited.  We saved some of the mushrooms fries for our steak, and then we waited some more.  Approximately 20 minutes later, our server said the steaks would be right out.  He took our small plates and silver away.  About 5 minutes went by and he stopped by once again and said the steaks would be right there.  About 5 minutes later, he stopped by to say they'd be out in about a minute.  This time, he was right.\u000a\u000aWhen the steaks arrived, I noticed that both had been cut in slices and I just cringed.  I absolutely hate it when this is done.  Maybe that's why so FEW places do it.  I asked if there was a culinary reason and the server said he'd ask.  When he came back he told us that the chefs said it was to make the steaks more tender.  My steak was good, but it was cooked a little more than I would do it at home.  My wife's steak was less tender and because of her medium order, which they did, the steak was less juicy and there was a fair amount of sinew that you wouldn't expect.  She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.  But above all, I'd say, please don't cut my steak.  I'm not a two year old and I'm not infirm.  I Googled this when I got home and found that the only reason (perhaps) to do this was to cut the steak against the grain the right way.\u000a\u000aWe each had a sundae for dessert.  They were OK.\u000a\u000aI left Echo & Rig very disappointed.  The length of time from ordering to getting our mains was ridiculous when the place is less than 1/10 full.  It was a Tuesday afternoon--not date night USA at 8 PM.

VAfter the Yelp event, I met Tony T. (The duke of Café Teaze) in the lobby and he told me some of the Yelp crew ere going to the café.  Off I went on Spring Mountain Road and after looking for a bit on the second floor of this mostly Asian food mall, I found Café Teaze on the west side of the building.  \u000a\u000aI also noted that Roger T. was already checked in here and he had created a UYE to celebrate Tony's birthday.  I opened the door and walked in to Café Teaze to see lovely ladies and some Yelp friends.  I had been a bit reticent to come here alone, so now there was safety in numbers.  Soon others arrived and we had a fine time.\u000a\u000aOne of the ladies came for my order and I got an iced taro milk tea with boba.  Tony told me that was his favorite drink--hot--so next time I'll try it that way.  The tea was excellent.  It's served in a mason jar with a handle.\u000a\u000aI soon learned that they have snacks and I got the chance to try some popcorn chicken Taiwanese style.  Wow, great!!  \u000a\u000aThe concept is fun and the ladies certainly provide great eye candy serving wearing only lingerie.  It's difficult to keep from staring and that's OK because that's part of Café ´Teaze. I guess you could call it no guilt ogling. \u000a\u000aI surely won't get the number of check ins Tony has, but I'll be back--for the food, of course.  Oh, and the tea!  It's sort of like getting Playboy solely for the articles.\u000a\u000aTo see the ladies, look at Tony's photo, the first one.

VA savory crêpe for breakfast?  It sounded like a good idea and it was.  While waiting at an office yesterday morning, I did a Yelp search and found The Crêpe was on the way home.  After the appointment, off I was to Tivoli Place for breakfast.\u000a\u000aThere was a sign to seat yourself and I went a few tables in from the open door.  It was a perfect place because you could enjoy the morning air but the breeze coming in wasn't overwhelming.\u000a\u000aI was brought a menu by Agnes.  I later found out she was the owner.  After looking over the selection of breakfast crêpes, I went with the special of the day which was a crêpe with pastrami, scrambled eggs, potatoes, and Russian mustard.\u000a\u000aThe crêpe was very tasty.  The mustard absolutely made the dish, however.  It was a rich, spicy, brown mustard with a lot of favor.\u000a\u000aAs I was waiting for the crêpe to be made, Agnes came by and as we starting chatting, she sat down across the table from me and she explained that the restaurant had only been opened for two months.  We also talked about the music and dance evenings they have.  I think I need to go back for one of the jazz nights and have a dessert crêpe.\u000a\u000aThe crêpe was tasty and it was artfully presented.  As I said before, the mustard made the dish!  I will come back again.  I like the space and the ambiance.  The crêpes are a bit pricey, but then the rents for Tivoli have to be high, too!  A coffee Americano is $3 with a $1.50 charge for a refill.  I guess that's because it's individually brewed Lavazza but it's quite different when I'm used to a bottomless cup at breakfast!

VI went to see Meat Loaf tonight and I liked the show a lot.  He did a wide range of his songs and he did the one I was hoping he would perform--Paradise By the Dashboard Lights.\u000a\u000aI really didn't know who Meat Loaf was until I had to chaperone dances as high school principal.  Almost every dance, the girls, especially, would request the DJ play Paradise.  The girls sang the lyrics..."Will you love me..." and the boys would respond with "...let me think on it..."  That's when I knew who Meat Loaf was.  My musical tastes had diverged from rock after graduate school and the beginning of working for a living.  "Paradise" was well done tonight and I brought back so many good memories.\u000a\u000aI was surprised to know that Meat Load did the music for Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Seriously, folks, I have not lived under a rock for the last 30 years or so.  It's just that I knew the name and didn't associate his name with some of the music.\u000a\u000aNear the end of the show, they have some large artificial penises from which they shoot T-shirts.  I caught one tonight.  The little lady next to me thought she was going to get.  Afraid not, sweetheart.  I hope your black and blue goes away soon!   The shirt says "I Saw Meat Loaf in Las Vegas."  Now I'm glad I went.  Wait, I live here!\u000a\u000aThis is a show I could easily see again.  It's very enjoyable and Meat Loaf really puts all his energy into a good 2 hour performance.  There was one complaint I had about the show.  He proved his Indian name was correct!  Now you have to go see the show to know what I mean!

VWe came for dinner before seeing Human Nature.  I didn't watch the Cake Boss show but I knew about it and wanted to try the restaurant.  We were early and they were still serving lunch so we ordered an appetizer so we could order off the dinner menu.\u000a\u000aWe got an order of Nina's mozzarella en carozza.  It was like having a toasted cheese sandwich with mozzarella cheese with some tasty marinara.  It was very good.  We shared the order and each had two wedges.\u000a\u000aFor our mains, my wife ordered  Nonna's lasagna.  It came with beef, pork, sausage, and four kinds of cheese and it was huge.  We could have split this between the two of us had we known how large it would be.  It probably weighed a pound at the very least and it was very good.  We brought 2/3 of it home and have it frozen for a meal for the two of us.\u000a\u000aI got the Sunday Gravy.  How could I not go with his signature dish.  It's meatballs, sausage, lamb, and pork simmered in a Sunday gravy and served with a bowl of rigatoni.  The rigatoni was a sensible serving size, but when you added all the meat, this also was a dish that could have been shared.  This dish is worth the praise it gets from reviewers.  The Sunday gravy is excellent and the meat is so tender from the hours of cooking in the gravy!  Saving room for dessert, we opted to have part of this boxed also.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, we wanted something small and went with our server's recommendation of the Nutella Cake, cake with a warm Nutella center, chocolate sauce, some praline crunch, and served with salted caramel ice cream.  It was delicious and perfect to share at the end of the meal.\u000a\u000aOur server, Graciela, was a gem.  She was around often to check on us.  The bus people refilled iced tea glasses quickly,  Service was very good!  The only drawback was the large Palazzo sign along the Boulevard which was at the level of the windows and was extraordinarily bright.  They have a shade which was partially lowered but it should have been lowered more or we should have changed our seating position at the table so our backs were toward the sign.\u000a\u000aA very pleasant evening in a really good restaurant!

VGreat food, super staff, a pleasant environment--5 stars all the way.  After an appointment, I came here to have breakfast.  I had looked at the menu online and read other reviews and I was all set to get something more on the healthy side.  When Ashley came to take my order, I opened my mouth and out came, "Didn't I read that you had some kind of Elvis breakfast?"\u000a\u000aFolks, don't be confused like I was.  There it is, hiding in the sandwiches and not under the breakfast section of the menu.  Ashley showed me where it was and that's what I ordered.  Peanut butter is healthy, no?\u000a\u000aBreakfast consisted of two slices of French toast with bananas, bacon, peanut butter, and Nutella inside--something from each of the five food groups so I deemed it healthy!\u000a\u000aBefore ordering, I was brought a very large cup of coffee.  You almost need to use both hands to pick it up and it was refilled quickly when I needed the push to be able to do stupid things faster.\u000a\u000aMy breakfast was brought and it was delicious!  I think Elvis would be pleased that he's being remembered with some good food like this.\u000a\u000aAll the staff at MTO was outstanding.  One of the bus persons asked me how my breakfast was as he removed my plate.  When I said, "Excellent," he replied with a, "That's what we like to hear," and a big smile.  I chatted with another staff member about restaurants in Los Angeles and he gave me a tip about a place to go in San Gabriel.  \u000a\u000aI have to come back and get the pancakes with carrots and coconut.  It looks too good not to try!

VThese guys are really talented.  Five men singing a cappella and filling in the voice parts with one or two of the men providing "instrumental" accompaniment.  I was sure in the first couple of songs that they had to have a live or recorded percussion accompaniment, but I was proven wrong.\u000a\u000aThe Shimmer Showroom in the LVH is a small theatre and it lends itself very well to this kind of show.  No one is more than 25 feet or so from the stage.  That's how I found out I was wrong about the percussion track.\u000a\u000aOne of my favorite parts of the show was when four of the five came to the front and did their own solo "instruimental" -- one playing electric guitar, one bass, one harmonica, and one doing trombone.  They were quite talented and this really showcased their talent.\u000a\u000aI had seen the group when they opened for George Wallace and when they did a number or two at the Ribbon of Life two times.  Seeing their entire show, which lasts just over one hour, gave me a chance to see their talent in full.\u000a\u000aI highly recommend this show.  The price is right, the room is great, and they are terrific!

VI tried Settebello for the first time last night.  I had read the reviews of my Yelp friends and likes the sound of the Rafael pizza which was on their special of the day and it sounded good.  \u000a\u000aWhen I talked to the young man at the podium and told him I wanted to place a To Go order, I told him about the pizza and the reviews.  He told me he'd check and a short time later, he came back and told me they could make it but they didn't have the caramelized onions for it.  I told him to order it anyway.\u000a\u000aIn just a few short minutes, the pizza was brought to me as I waited in their small waiting area.  I brought it home and it was very good.  It was also the perfect size for two people.\u000a\u000aMy preference is still for thick crust, Sicilian style pizza, but I can see that Settebello will be on my rotation list.  And, I want to try some of the others as well.\u000a\u000aGood service and good pizza!

VI stopped by here today to try their drinks and to check it out for a future Yelp Book Club meeting.\u000a\u000aI wanted something cold as the day was warmer than I'd dressed for.  I had read the Yelp reviews and the one thing that people had been ordering and liking was their pistachio latte.  I ordered a pistachio frappuccino.  It was quickly made and I took a seat.  The pastry case had been hit by holiday shoppers because there wasn't much left.  I could have gotten something but it was easier to pass this time.\u000a\u000aI sat at one of their tables and took a few photos for this review.  Then I checked for wifi.  A locked wifi.  I went to the counter and they pointed to the left side of the chalk menu board and the password is there.  The wifi was pretty zippy, but there weren't a whole lot of people there.\u000a\u000aThis is a good distance from where I live but when I'm in the neighborhood for something else, this is a good place to stop.  And, this will make an excellent place for our Yelp book club meeting.

VI watched this place sit idle during the Great Recession and then was so pleased to see something going in there when the economy improved.  Toros Spanish Kitchen & Gaming is a good addition to the small shopping center.\u000a\u000aWe stopped last night and had dinner.  I had looked over the menu online but I wanted to look at theirs in house as there were other items than the tapas I'd seen online.  Our server brought iced tea.  We had to wait a bit to catch the server's eye to get some Sweet 'n Low but eventually we got it.\u000a\u000aThe complimentary toasted slices of bread was nice.  I used it more for a pusher than anything else.  \u000a\u000aI ordered three items to start_an order of sautéed mushrooms in garlic and sherry wine, gnocchi with shrimp in a garlic cream sauce (I thought I'd be able to sneak the shrimp past my wife), and last, an order of croquetas with ham, cream cheese, and béchamel.  \u000a\u000aThe winner of the trio was the gnocchi with shrimp.  When my wife got to the one shrimp I hadn't been able to screen out with the spoon, that was all for her.  Score for me--I finished the dish.  The gnocchi were soft and the shrimp, although small, were good.  It was a nice combination.  Next, the garlic mushrooms were really good.  Sautéed nicely in garlic and sherry, the mushrooms were very good.  The disappointing dish for me was the croquetas.  They were very light and had hardly and body to them yet it was difficult to pick them up.  They broke in half.  There was not a béchamel sauce but a marinara like sauce.\u000a\u000aWe decided not to order more.  The three dishes were filling--well almost.  We ordered the chocolate lava cake.  It takes 15 minutes to make (the menu states this clearly so if you're in a hurry, order early).  The lava cake was rich chocolate cake with chocolate sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  A nice way to end a good dinner.\u000a\u000aService was spotty.  Our server seemed to be nowhere in sight for much of the time while the server who had the tables on each side of us seemed to be at those tables all the time and the place was not that crowded.  During dinner, the owner came around to ask how things were and the personal touch is always appreciated.  It's also very good business.  The spotty service kept me from giving Toros four stars.\u000a\u000aI thought the pricing was very fair.  If you subtract the desert we had from the bill, the total would equal about what I paid for 1 person at another tapas place and I left hungry.  Two of us ate for the same coast and we left without feeling hunger.\u000a\u000aWe need to come back and try some of the other dishes.  I also need to come back with some friends and without my wife.  There are items I'd like to try from the menu that she won't eat!  Her loss.  Time for a UYE?

VBefore the Las Vegas Great Santa Run, I had breakfast at Stewart + Ogden.  It wasn't busy at all and the hostess took me to a seat immediately and gave me a menu.  She came back quickly with a complimentary copy of the Review Journal for reading then or taking with me.\u000a\u000aMy server came by the table quickly and asked about coffee and i soon had a hot cup of coffee on that cold morning.  It was refilled several times in the time I was there.\u000a\u000aI ordred the fried green tomato Benny--eggs Benedict made a different way.  The base is not an English muffin but two slices of green tomatoes, breaded and fried, topped with lump crab meat, and topped by two poached eggs and a remoulade sauce that had a nice zing.  The Benny was served with a small field green salad.  The breakfast was very good.  I liked having a Benedict done a different way.  \u000a\u000aThe thing that got me about Stewart + Ogden was the staff.  Everyone worked together.  Although I had a server, not one person went by with a coffee pot that didn't stop to ask me if I needed a refill.  Also, the staff were all very polite and pleasant people who seemed genuinely happy to have you in their restaurant.  It was a very nice feeling.\u000a\u000aStewart + Ogden is a little pricey--it's not your bargain breakfast, but if you're looking for something different and outstanding service, I recommend Stewart + & Ogden highly.  Oh, and their menu stating the legend of this being near where Archibald Stewart and Peter Ogden once shared a meal is probably a made up legend for the new Downtown Grand.  It sounds good, but it's unlikely!

VI came here for the UYE last night and loved it!  The staff was simply the best and the food was good.  It was my first time at one of these seafood places and the staff talked me through the entire process.  \u000a\u000aI ordered a pound of shrimp, medium spice, with the sauce being the Hot N Juicy which is a combination of all their sauces.  you put on your bib and some plastic gloves and when your bag of goodness arrives, you dig in and start taking off the shells.\u000a\u000aAfter awhile, I got really frustrated with the slowness at which I was removing shells.  I took off the gloves and then the process became easier--messier fingers but faster work.\u000a\u000aRobin was our main server and she was a GEM!  What a pleasant woman and what a help!\u000a\u000aI will be back.  This is one of the things I do by myself unless my wife wants to have fried chicken fingers.  How you limit yourself if you don't do seafood!

VThe only thing premium about this place is the price they charge for their food.  I opted to go here to use a Groupon and because its location in the Miracle Mile Shops makes it an easy walk from the garage elevators to the restaurant for my wife.\u000a\u000aI ordered two burgers--a mushroom and Swiss and a Western.  The mushroom and Swiss was supposed to be medium and the Western was to be rare.  With them, I ordered the soda/fries combo.  All that for a mere $36 including the $20 Groupon.\u000a\u000aI went to the self serve area and got three flavors of ketchup.  I tried the balsamic ketchup, the maple bacon ketchup, and the fry sauce.  I also got our two iced teas and napkins.\u000a\u000aThe orders were brought and the mushroom Swiss was correct by burger was the wrong one so she took it back and eventually brought out a Western.  That's when my disappointment set it.  The burgers were larger and flatter than a hockey puck, but they were really lacking much flavor from the toppings.  They were also very, very dry.  I am a person who very rarely uses ketchup. I think it's a bastard food item meant to hide the taste of things on which it's spread.   When I put some on a burger, you know it's awfully dry and it needs something to make it taste better.  No luck.  It wasn't so dry, but the taste, oh it never was there.  The bacon on my Western was odd.  It was very tough although it had been cooked throughly.\u000a\u000aThere were a few things that made the experience tolerable.  I liked the women in their short shorts.  They looked quite fine.  The free wifi (well, I guess with the prices you should never refer to it as free wifi) worked well and was zippy.  Ask someone who works there for the password.  The wait for the burger was not long.  How did they overcook the meat that quickly to the point of desert dryness?  It's a puzzlement!  One more thing, the fries were good.\u000a\u000aI realize I now have two rules for buying Groupons.  Rule #1:  Always check the Yelp reviews before buying.  Rule #2:  Don't forget Rule #1.  I guess I got to Rule #2 and didn't follow Rule #2.  Fool me once!\u000a\u000aThere are so many good burger places along the Strip, don't waste your time and money here.  It simply is not worth it.

VI didn't know there was a Nielsen's in the Las Vegas area until I stopped at Nielsen's in St. George, Utah two years ago.  They had a sign with the new address for their Henderson store.  I bookmarked the place then but never thought to stop.  If you're an avid Yelper, you understand that when it comes to bookmarks.\u000a\u000aSince the burger joint went to doesn't serve dessert, and we had plenty of time before going to the Sin City Opera, we drove to Henderson and onto that piece of Eastern Avenue that can be the most frustrating drive.  I had no trouble finding Nielsen's and it was fun introducing my wife to something I enjoyed in Utah.\u000a\u000aI got a vanilla concrete with cheesecake.  Concrete is the thick frozen custard whipped with whatever you choose to have in it.  They have three flavors of custard--vanilla, chocolate, and the flavor of the day which was Rocky Road last night.\u000a\u000aThe concrete was very good and exactly like what I had in St. George.  My wife enjoyed her raspberry sundae.  The shop in Henderson is very small.  There is a considerable amount of old time things to give the shop a nostalgic air.  Check these out.  They are quite interesting.  There's also a small patio in the front with some seating there.\u000a\u000aI'm glad this is on the other side of town from me.  If it was closer, I'd probably be stopping more often.

VI just made a cursory stop to get some photos on my jaunt downtown earlier this week so I can't give the Container Park a full review.  I really like what they've done with this space.  It's hard to believe that only a block away was the site of the Western Casino, the much maligned spot on Fremont Street.\u000a\u000aUntil December 8th, the Project Y.E.S. spaceship will be in the Learning Center area for kids to explore.  Check the Downtown Project's website for ticket information (there is no charge for the tickets).\u000a\u000aI'll be back in another day--at night--and I hope to see more as I have the time to walk around inside the Container Park and enjoy the vibes of this place.

VIn the new Downtown Container Park, just as you enter on the left, is this small coffee outlet.  It's a satellite of the Beat Coffeehouse on Fremont Street.  There is a limited menu and no seating.  It's a walk up window where you place your order and then take a seat somewhere nearby.\u000a\u000aThe staff last night was absolutely delightful!  Friendly, smiling, and helpful.  Instead of coffee, I got a large hot chocolate and I took it to the second floor of the Container Park and sipped it as I watched the praying mantis blow fire!  What a hoot!  The hot chocolate was very good and just the thing for a cold evening.\u000a\u000aThis is definite stop the next time I'm at the Container Park.

VI was on my way to ride my bike and hike near Lake Mead and I decided to do a little detour and have breakfast on Water Street in Henderson.  I daresay I haven't been on the street in 40 plus years.  The place I had bookmarked was closed so I walked across the street to the Eldorado Casino--owned by the Boyd Group--to have breakfast there.\u000a\u000aMary's Diner is a 50s kind of place with lots of memorabilia from the era.  This is so off the beaten path that I think all of the customers were locals.  This is not a destination casino.\u000a\u000aI ordered the chili and cheese omelette.  It comes with breakfast potatoes and toast.  It was very good and very filling.  My server was Stacey and she was a delight!  \u000a\u000aWhile eating, I enjoyed the music of that era playing on the loudspeakers.  I couldn't help but hum the tunes.  The music of my younger days!\u000a\u000aThis was a good breakfast spot.

VFour of us met here for lunch so that we could try several dishes to try Portuguese food.  The owner, Lubka, told us it was the only Portuguese restaurant in Las Vegas.  \u000a\u000aWe were brought rolls and our drinks came quickly.  We ordered several starters to share.  First was a half chorizo that was cooked with red wine and flame grilled tableside.\u000a\u000aNext, we had the dish Halloumi, goat cheese grilled over cypress and served with a sweet and sour sauce. \u000a\u000aNext came the snails cooked with a chardonnay white wine and garlic sauce and broiled with mixed cheeses and served with some toast slices.\u000a\u000aNext was Bacalao, a dish made up of salted cod, mashed potatoes, garlic, onions, eggs and extra virgin olive oil and served with a salad of mixed greens.  Lubka (Luby) told us how they treated the salt cod daily with whole milk to remove the saltiness of the cod so it wasn't overpoweringly salty.\u000a\u000aThen onto the chicken Trinchado.  The chicken is marinated in red wine and grilled.  It's then put in the Trinchado sauce which had a nice paprika flavor and a small hint of cumin.\u000a\u000aThen we had the Calamari curry, a bowl of nicely cooked calamari in a curry sauce that didn't hit you up front but had a nice curry tang after the fact.  It was quite good.  With the calamari, we got rice and a container of chutney.  The flavors complimented each other nicely.\u000a\u000aWhen we thought we had no more room, Luby insisted we have some dessert.  We went with the tiramisu.  It's quite a different looking dish from common tiramisu.  The  ladyfingers weren't like most tiramisu but there was a wonderful chocolate and \u000acoffee flavor in the ladyfingers and the mascarpone cheese made this a wonderful ending dish.\u000a\u000aService was outstanding for the two hours or so that we were there.  We asked that the dishes not be brought out all at once and they did one at a time.  Luby came to the table and asked if it was OK to start the next dish.  She explained the dishes when she brought them and she was an absolute joy!  She's very proud of her food and she has reason to be proud!  \u000a\u000aThis was a very memorable lunch with good company, good conversation, excellent food, and outstanding and very pleasant service.  Thanks to LJ and Niyen for the heads up on Vila Algarve.  I certainly expect to come back soon. I have to try some of their chicken livers and gizzards.  We opted not to do the organ meats yesterday.  That omission will be rectified soon!

VI wanted to try this lunch buffet since reading some friends' reviews and I went today.  It's taken the #1 spot in the Indian lunch buffet spot with one restaurant yet to go.\u000a\u000aI was there early, about 11;15, and I was the first person in the restaurant.   There soon were several other customers.  It's a very large room with lots of tables laid out well and the buffet is a large area opposite the entrance.\u000a\u000aWith a check in on Yelp, you get either a mango lassi or a soda free.  It's a good deal for merely checking in.\u000a\u000aI ordered garlic naan and then headed to the buffet.  The naan was good but I wish it had more of a garlic flavor.  For the first plate, I had chicken Biryani, a couple vegetable pakoras, a vegetable samosa, a piece of tandoori chicken, some chili chicken, soya badi, and some saag paneer.  Everything I had was very good and I noticed that almost all dishes had a spiciness that I liked.  Of these, the weakest dishes was the saag paneer.  The crust of the samosa was flaky and the filling was very good.  The soya badi was quite good.\u000a\u000aFor my second plate, I had squash, Navratan korma, chicken curry, and chana masala.  All of these were very good save the squash which was a little nondescript.  I also tried some of their raita which was good.  The chicken curry didn't have very much of a curry flavor but when the juices from the chana masala mixed with the curry juice, it became much better.\u000a\u000aFinally, I went back and got one idli and put a small amount of tamarind chutney on it.  It had a soft texture and was good.  I was a but disappointed that they had no dhokla.  I had read Christopher S.' review and I was interested in trying something different.\u000a\u000aOverall, this is a very solid buffet and moves to the top tier of Indian restaurants.  The price is now $10.99 but that's still very good considering the wide choice you have with their large buffet.\u000a\u000aService was very good!  Several times, someone stopped by to see how things were.  A woman stopped once and asked me if it was too spicy so they know that they spice their foods.  Plates were cleared before I came back each time.\u000a\u000aThis is another stop for after hiking when we go to an Indian buffet.  It's a great addition to the Indoian dining in Las Vegas.

VMichael U. had the idea that after our Doughnut Crawl Part - II, we'd go to this new Po-Boy sandwich shop near downtown Las Vegas.  A caravan of five or six cars went form the northwest to Streetcar.\u000a\u000aThe owner helped move two extra tables to a booth and we had enough room for the 15 or so of us who descended on the place.\u000a\u000aFour of us decided to get one sandwich each and split the sandwiches into quarters so that we could each try a little bit of several sandwiches.  It was a super idea.  We ordered a Streetcar which has shrimp, oysters, and catfish.  Sandwich two was the Bourbon Street--roast beef with gravy.  The third sandwich was the Crescent City, a muffuletta.  The fourth was a Marie Laveau which is boudin sausage.  We also had a Pirogue, a crawfish boudin because an error was made and they brought the wrong sandwich, but left it with us to enjoy while they made the correct one.  Most of the sandwiches came with chips and a small side of cole slaw.\u000a\u000aWith our sandwiches, we ordered three sides--deep fried macaroni and cheese, hush puppies, and corn fritters.  \u000a\u000aEverything was simply great!!  The bread is from the Leidenheimer Baking Company in New Orleans and is flown here for Streetcar.  The fillings in the sandwiches were excellent.  My favorite was Marie Laveua, the boudin sausage Po-boy.  The deep freind mac and cheese was excellent as were the corn fritters.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, they brought us some praline King Cake they were trying out.  It was very flavorful.  Michael U. had pre-ordered a King Cake and they were waiting for us to come before they dressed the cake so the icing and other things on top were fresh.  I have not yet tried my King Cake because I'm still in a food coma.\u000a\u000aService was very, very good.  Gwen, the owner, was a wonderful, welcoming person who made us feel at home at her piece of NOLA in Las Vegas.  Our main server D'nis was very good and a friendly person.  Gwen gave the three young ones in the group a small stuffed animal.  That was very kind of her.\u000a\u000aIn the piece of praline King Cake I got was the baby that's baked into the cake.  That means I have to buy the next King Cake or host the next Mardi Gras gathering.  OK, Mel C., Terri R., and Michael U., put this on your calendar for next year.  We return, get four sandwiches and some sides again, and I'm buying.  \u000a\u000aI can't wait to come back here for the alligator Po-boy.  It's been awhile since I had alligator!

VI'm not a fan of O'Sheas.  It certainly wouldn't be my casino of choice if I was wandering the Strip.  That said, I'm sure the table limits are low and when I've been there for shows, it seems to have a younger, louder, more alcohol impaired crowd.  Not my kind of casino, but there are worse.\u000a\u000aThe food court in the back looks perfectly fine for a quick eat.  The garage has to rank up there as being one of the worst in Las Vegas.  There are competitors, but this one can hold its own.  Just try finding it.

VI go to Starbucks every day.  This was my first time at this new location on East Flamingo in the Howard Hughes Center.\u000a\u000aThe shop is roomy, it has lots of product (juices, pastries, and sandwiches--typical Starbucks stuff.  The wifi is free and it's fast--faster since Starbucks converted from AT&T to Google for their wifi.  There are two areas to sit outside.  There are some tables along the front and there's a patio on the east side.  Since the building is quite tall, it gives you shade in the afternoon.\u000a\u000aThere are plenty of chairs and one long table with stools where you can work with a laptop or just use your smartphone.  It's far enough away from UNLV that students won't walk here to hang, study, and otherwise be their normal pains in the butt as they are across Maryland Parkway from that Bucky.  This will just be a place where the adults come to use Bucky's wifi so they can conduct their businesses from their "office."\u000a\u000aThe staff was on the ball today and it was a good stop.  I'll be back again now that I know the store is open.

VWow!  Now that I've been to Rose.Rabbit.Lie, I understand how the whole thing fits together and works.  I had a free ticket for the show last night and I made a dinner reservation, too.  The website said they were fully booked, but when I called the Cosmopolitan, she made a reservation for me.\u000a\u000aI got my ticket at the box office on the second floor and went to the Rose.Rabbit.Lie entrance at 6 PM for my reservation.  There was a couple in line ahead of me.  They weren't yet open.  There's a lot of security and ear pieces in this area across from the Wicked Spoon buffet.  When they opened, the woman asked me if I wanted a table or to sit at a bar.  Since I was alone, I told her the bar.  She asked which one I wanted to go to and I couldn't answer.  I let her choose and she took me to the Library Bar.\u000a\u000aThere are several rooms behind closed doors after you enter the main door.  On the left was the Library, a small room with about 8 tables and 8 or so seats at the bar.  I took the end seat and I was so glad this was where I was.  We could hear the music from next door--it turned out to be the Music Room--and the bartender who waited on me was Anthony!  He was perfect--knowledgable about the menu and he made some great recommendations to me.  \u000a\u000aMost of the dishes are tapas style.  I ordered the Brussels sprouts with crispy chicken skin. Manchego cheese and Spanish paprika.  I also ordered Tête de Cochon--pig head with a slow cooked egg.  The pig head was cooked and the meat was seasoned and formed into a small rectangle.  It was lightly battered with panko breadcrumbs and lightly fried.  Served with a soft poached egg, it was delightful.  Breaking the egg and letting it run over the pork was so very good!  The Brussels sprouts were wonderful!  I could not have had two better recommendations!\u000a\u000aI chose desert on my own.  I ordered the butterscotch pudding with a chocolate and hazelnut "stone".  The dessert was a perfect ending to the meal.  The butterscotch was salted and the "stone" was very tasty!\u000a\u000aService was excellent and sitting at the bar was a show in itself.  Anthony showed me and the gentleman seated next to me the 3 kinds of special ice cubes they make for Rose.Rabbit.Lie.  Quite interesting and creative.\u000a\u000aFrom here, I was shown to the Music Room where I listened to a 5 piece combo play.  There was a singer who walked on the bar in the Music Room.  One of the entertainer/ushers--a friend of mine--came in to work.  I had no idea he had gotten a job here.  He told me that we'd be shown into the Ballroom (another place to eat and drink) and then we'd go to the showroom.  The combo and the singers went into the Ballroom and then the doors were opened to the Showroom.  \u000a\u000aThe show is called Vegas Nocturne and although the website lists it as 70 minutes, it's more like 95 minutes in length.  There are two types of chairs and I got seated in a row that had the hard folding chairs.\u000a\u000aThe show is a milder version of its cousin, Absinthe.  The acts are lower key in a way because of the low ceiling.  The acts are very good, the comedy is quite funny, and it was a perfect end for my evening.  Katy Perry was in the audience.\u000a\u000aThis was a wonderful evening and I'm so glad I went.  I'm not sure I'd pay the full price for the show.  It's a bit steep considering the other entertainment available on the Strip but as part of an entire evening at Rose.Rabbit.Lie, it was just perfect!

VIn my previous life in education, I heard so much about changing our ideas--our culture--and I always thought it was so much happy horse shit! When I read Tony Hsieh's book "Delivering Happiness" and I saw the word culture so much, it gave me déja vu all over again.  (Thanks Yogi)  After my tour of Zappos today, I get it and how it works for this company.  \u000a\u000aYou sign up online for the tour.  Parking is in the Zappos' garage off Las Vegas Boulevard before Stewart.  You go to the second floor, sign in with the person in the lobby, and wait for your tour.  You're given an ID badge and a name tag.  Several culture reps divide the group and take you to see Zappos at work.  My culture person was Renée and she was a gem!  She was always happy to be asked a question and she had the answers for us.\u000a\u000aWe saw some of the call center, the culture section where employees were dealing with customers either online or on the phone.  We got to see the Z Café and the employee patio.\u000a\u000aI am sure that the employees are not always smiling and not always happy, but I did see a whole bunch of people who seemed to be happily doing their jobs in a relaxed, informal setting and the idea of culture that Mr. Hsieh has been so focused on works!\u000a\u000aThe tour lasts just about an hour.  You are free to bring your camera and take photos.  The only thing they ask is that you don't take photos of computer screens (it might have customer information on it or other things that should remain private) and they ask that there be no video.\u000a\u000aThis is a tour that would be interesting for anyone to take.  It's amazing to see what they did to the old Las Vegas City Hall.

VPanda! is a fun and entertaining show.  It's also a show that many children would like because of the pandas in the theatre entrance and during the show.  As you enter the theatre, there's an opportunity for a photo op with a large panda for you and/or the kids.  There are also pandas on the stairs. Kids of all ages seem to be drawn by those cute animals.  You want to see a panda break dance?  Come see this show!\u000a\u000aI would describe the show as a mix of acrobatics, kung fu,  and dance.   There is a whole lot less acrobatics than you see in a Cirque du Soleil show but that's perfectly OK.  There is interaction with the audience at times and the performers of all ages are very talented and have trained well!\u000a\u000aA couple of things really got to the theatre person in me.  The "curtain" consists of about 35 weighted, cloth tubes onto which different things can be projected.  Before the show, it looks like large stalks of bamboo growing.  Because the curtain is in so many sections, they can raise a small section to reveal one character, lower that section, and raise another section on the other side of the stage.  And the whole thing can be at different levels to add to the staging.\u000a\u000aThe projections on the back wall and on various objects lowered from above are outstanding!  One is a volcanic eruption that fits into the story somewhat.  Another brings some humor when live performers dance in unison with a large number of terra cotta soldiers.  That was really well done!\u000a\u000aThe music and the costumes are beautiful. For me, it added to the story but I have always liked classical Asian music of this type.  \u000a\u000aThe show started promptly at 7:30 and ended at 8:57.  It is really an entertaining show.

VI haven't had a pasty since I lived in the East.  I used to buy them from churches that had sales and sometimes I made my own.  Let me say that none of the purchased nor homemade were as good as the ones I bought today.\u000a\u000aI was in the area--deliberately--today and I stopped and asked about whether it would be OK to purchase a part baked pasty at 1 and leave it in the refrigerator until late in the afternoon and then bake it.  No problem, I was told.  A couple of hours later, after my Chinese New Year photo op was complete, I came back and got two Oggies, part baked, to bring home.  \u000a\u000aWhile waiting, my order taker, Alexis, asked if I wanted water or something else.  I got a diet Coke.  Before I knew it, she was back with a nice little bag with the wrapped pasties ready to go.  The Oggie has small steak chunks, thinly sliced potatoes, rutabaga, and onion all wrapped in this wonderful pastry.  I saw them put a tray of pasties into the oven and I wish I had been where I could have gotten a photo.\u000a\u000aThere was a miscommunication or simple forgetfulness, but I didn't get any red wine gravy with the pasties.  I asked about that before I Ieft, one of the men at the bar said that it would be in there--pointing to my bag.  Were it not for that small slip, I would have given Cornish Pasty a full 5 stars.  Regardless, the pasty was fantastic!  It was wrapped beautifully and the baking directions were on the wrapper where I couldn't miss it.\u000a\u000aSince this is in the Sahara Commercial Center, I have a feeling I'll be stopping here for some pasties before shows at the Onyx Theatre nearby.  It's also a quick meal to make on those days when you don't want to slave over the hot stove.  Also, you can get ANY pasty part baked, not just the Oggie!\u000a\u000aWhat a great find!  Thank you fellow Yelpers for cluing me into this new place!

VI am upping my review to 5 stars.  I recently made my second stop here and got pasties for 2 dinners.  We had some that night and I froze the other two for a later day--today in fact--when I needed to have a good dinner done quickly.\u000a\u000aAfter volunteering for the National Park Service for 10 hours today, I came home tired and hungry.  I had taken the pasties out of the freezer, they were thawed, and in 20 minutes, I had a good dinner for the two of us.\u000a\u000aWe have now tried the Oggie, a Cottage Pie, a chicken Alfredo, and a peppered steak.  Tonight's peppered steak had sirloin pieces, leeks, zucchini, and Stilton cheese.  The sauce was excellent.  My wife enjoyed her chicken Alfredo.\u000a\u000aThe staff was super when I was there and I know this place will be on my stopping list often!

VI think one would like this show if they were a fan of the Pawn Stars show.  I've wanted to see the show because I've seen most of the cast in local theatre in Las Vegas and I was eager to see how they did this spoof.\u000a\u000aThe show is just under an hour and I was surprised at how quickly the hour went by.  The lead characters who play the spoof characters of Slick, Lil' Boss, and Chump look like the real life Pawn Stars.  This gives the show a familiar look to those who watch the TV series.\u000a\u000aA summary of this show could be that it has a very thin script and is goofy and corny.  There are bits that make you groan and other times laugh.  You know something is not quite right when my biggest laugh was the producer's mention of the "Real Housewives of Pahrump."  \u000a\u000aThe show is stolen by the antics of Enoch Scott.  His main part is to be the voice for the Old Man puppet.  However, his many roles are where the show goes off track, funny and goofy though they be.  Trying to move the story along, Scott plays a number of characters and it stretches the idea of spoof a bit thin.\u000a\u000aPut all this together and add two Las Vegas showgirls (very pretty I might add), and you have a show that's trying to hard and succeeds at little.

VAfter seeing the good reviews for Goodwich and having friends recommend it, I had to stop by and I made plans to do so on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aIt was a little after noon but there was little wait.  My order was taken and I had a seat in the shade of the front of the stand while waiting.  During that time, it was interesting to see tourists and locals walk by on the Boulevard.  Quite a cross section of humanity going by.\u000a\u000aThe sandwich came and it was packed nicely in a bag.  It was wrapped in paper and sealed with one of their logo stickers.  The sandwich, the foie, was very good.  It was filled with ingredients.  There's no scrimping here.  The crispy chicken skin and the almond were a nice touch for texture.  I had the sandwich Monte Cristo style and it was nicely grilled.  I also had a diet soda to go with the sandwich.\u000a\u000aThis is a good place to stop but I'm not a fan of sitting nearly on the sidewalk or in my car.  Hopefully, the guys will be able to get a real shop (if that's their goal).  In that case, I would be more likely to make follow up visits.  This isn't close to my house nor am I in this area that often unless planned.  I'm not sure I'd make the effort to try another sandwich here.

VI attended a Yelp event at Bobby's Burger Palace shortly after it opened and I've been intending to get back there.  My wife had never been there so we went last night.  We valeted at Mandarin Oriental and had a short walk to the back door.  The restaurant was fairly empty at 5:15.  The only people in line were Clark County firefighters from the local house by Vdara.\u000a\u000aI got a bleu burger and my wife got a Miami burger .  We each got an order of regular fries as iced tea.  My burger was done rare and my wife's medium.  My burger was very juicy--my wife's less so but that's what happens when you cook it too much-the way she wants it.  The fries were good and I could become addicted to the chipotle mayo served with them.  \u000a\u000aService was quite good.  Different servers asked about iced tea refills and plates were removed in a timely manner so we could munch on our fries.\u000a\u000aI wouldn't do this too often when I have a better choice near home, but when near CityCenter, the MO valet option makes this a place that will be on our list once in awhile.

VI was running errands today and I decided to stop here and experience what some of my friends have been talking about.  It really is a well done tea and coffee shop with pastries too.  \u000a\u000aI ordered berry black tea, iced and I got some macarons top bring home.  The gentleman asked if I wanted a stamp card and he spread the cards out so I could choose the one I wanted.  I wrote my name on it and hung it on the wall.  He then told me to sit anywhere and he'd bring the things to me when they were ready.\u000a\u000aI sat at a low seat near two primary desks/seats from an old school.  It reminded me of the desks I'd seen for so many years as a teacher when I was in the elementary school.\u000a\u000aIn a short time, the gentleman brought me a tray with a pot of hot berry tea and a glass with ice.  He told me if I needed any more ice or hot water that I was just to ask.\u000a\u000aLater, he came back to ask if I needed any more hot water and I asked for some more ice.  The tea was very tasty.  Serving the tea in the small wooden tray with a leaf and wind up toy was really a nice touch.\u000a\u000aEdit:  While I was drinking my tea, the gentleman came over with the macarons I had ordered.  They were placed in two bags with a nice sticker closure.  They are very tasty.  I tried one--all right--I tried a couple.  The chocolate especially stands out.\u000a\u000aThe only drawback for me today was the fact I was there alone.  This is definitely a place where you want to come with a friend or friends--maybe even sit in the VW canvas bus.  It's a place where you share conversation, play a game, or enjoy a pastry with someone else.\u000a\u000aI really like the way the place is decorated.  So many nostalgic things.  Thanks to Paolo's girl friend and Brian for the translation of the name.  I'll be back to get my stamp card off the hook and I'll come with a friend.  I need to find someone who wants to share some honey toast.  It looks so good.  Almost enough for three people.

VI decided to play tourist and go to the Strip to check out the newly opened Linq entertainment district between the Flamingo and the Quad.  I really like what they've done with this former street by turing it into a pedestrian space with shops, restaurants, and at the end, the High Roller, what will be--for awhile anyway--the tallest wheel of its type in the world.\u000a\u000aThere are lots of spaces to be rented yet and there are several that will be opening soon.  When completed, the Linq will offer a full compliment of entertainment whether shopping, eating/drinking, or riding a thrill ride.

VI finally got the chance to attend a Bingo UYE with Khatherine T. and a full table of Yelpers.  What fun!  Since several of us were going to see the Spazmatics in the showroom after bingo, we were encouraged to dress 80s style.\u000a\u000aIt was interesting to see how some people came to bingo.  Not just our group, but others who were also going to see the Spazmatics.\u000a\u000aAfter getting our tables under the large chandelier, Sylvia Q. went and got reserved signs to hold our seats.  Then a short wait in line to get our bingo games, pick up our electronic bingo machines, and we were ready to go.  The technology has improved so much you really have nothing to do but watch your screen and swear--well perhaps!\u000a\u000aWith the electronic machines, we were able to chat, laugh, and make fun of our friends.\u000a\u000aWhat a great way to spend an hour with some very fun and nice people!  I hope I can make the next one!

VThe last part of my playing tourist yesterday was to ride the High Roller.  It has been great fun to watch this being built and to anticipate riding it.  I have a fear of heights and I abhor glass elevators.  This seemed to me like the making of a perfect fetal position ride.  But, I screwed up my courage, bought my ticket, and scampered into the car.  \u000a\u000aLet's back up a bit.  You can buy tickets online, at one of the many self-serve kiosks in the Linq and other places around the Quad/Linq area.  You can also buy in person.  If you do, and you have a Total Rewards card, the $2 fee you pay online is discounted.  No special price for Nevada residents.\u000a\u000aAfter getting your ticket and going through several theme park like queuing areas, one on the first floor and then another one on the second floor at the top of the escalators.  \u000a\u000aAfter walking down a ramp, you're urged to move along quickly because the wheel generally doesn't stop and you enter after the people have exited on the other side.  Once everyone is in, the car door shuts and is locked.  The ride is very smooth and it was very easy for me to do.  I was so interested in moving from side to side taking photos and enjoying the view.  It really didn't bother me.\u000a\u000aAfter what seemed like 10 minutes, the ride was over and it was time to exit.  I strode down the ramp with a swagger as if to say, "Yes, I did it! Yo!" \u000a\u000aNow, to go back and do the ride at night to see the lights.

VThis new outlet by the owners of Patisserie Manon has many of the items the original on West Charleston has.  It seemed like the amount of items was less than the original, but there were still a lot of good choices.\u000a\u000aI liked the variety of flavors for the macarons and at $1.10 each, they are nicely priced.   I thought they were completely comparable to the original store.  I also got a raspberry torte which was very good.\u000a\u000aI'm not sure I'd stop in here very much. The original one is much closer to home and it can be dicey with the traffic to get across Rainbow if you need to getting into or leaving the location.\u000a\u000aThe seating area in the front of this former fast food restaurant is larger than the location on West Charleston but I never had an issue with that.  And, for those who want a quick visit, a drive through for a bakery is a bonus of their new location.\u000a\u000aA solid bakery with some good stuff!

VShort review:\u000a\u000aIt's an automatic fail when I come for breakfast and am there for at least 30 minutes and not once during that time did anyone come around to offer a coffee refill.  Not once.  \u000a\u000aLonger review:\u000a\u000aI saw Biscuits Cafe on Yelp and since it's close to home I decided I'd have to give it a go.  I wouldn't have ordered the biscuits and gravy combo but when in Rome... This is their signature, their biscuits.  The combo includes a choice of meat, I chose sausage, and two eggs any style.  I opted for over easy.\u000a\u000aThe order was done quickly.  I am not a connoisseur of biscuits and gravy.  In fact, I can't remember the last time I ordered this.  The biscuit was OK.  I'm not sure if it's supposed to be house made but I'm pretty sure it wasn't.  There was nothing special about it.  The gravy was OK, too, with a hint of ground pepper.  I'm certainly glad I didn't order the breakfast with two biscuits.  The sausage was two links that were sliced horizontally and grilled.  The eggs were done over easy.\u000a\u000aAll in all, breakfast was OK.  I should have stuck with an omelette or Benedict--my usual go to breakfast dishes.  But, I'll never know what they're like because I won't be back.  \u000a\u000aWhen I paid at the register, the woman asked for my member number.  When I told her I didn't have one, she asked me if I wanted to join their club.  My answer was a polite no.\u000a\u000aPeople, when you have three servers covering about 7 tables, it's not hard to bring a carafe of coffee around and offer warm ups or refills.  It should be something you dream about at night.  If one of your two specialties is breakfast and you fail on service for that, there's not much hope for you.

VThis is the part of Costco that I can review better than the store.  I am here many too many times but when you hike a lot in Southern Nevada, driving distances can be high and the need to stop here comes around soon.\u000a\u000aI try to go early in the morning, either on the way to the gym or on the way home.  If you get there before 9:30, you can generally be assured of no line.  My other favorite time is after 8 PM on weekdays.  You drive right up to the pump.  One of the attendant's, Peter, works nights, and he's a very pleasant fellow.\u000a\u000aGas prices are generally lower than other stations certainly those nearby.  There are times when I go to/from Chinatown that two station have competitive pricing to Costco and I'll stop there.\u000a\u000aI basically maintain my Costco membership for the gas and the few things I buy in the warehouse shopping part of Costco.

VI was doing the local playing tourist thing yesterday, and I decided to try Bachi HLK for a different breakfast.  I ordered coffee which was brought quickly and was refilled without asking for more.\u000a\u000aI think I knew from when I walked in the door that I'd have the brioche French toast and that's what I got.  A very flavorful stack of four brioche rounds, wonderfully soft and flavored nicely with almond.  On top of the stack were some banana slices and the plate had some small pieces of chopped kiwi and mango.  The plating was very nicely done.\u000a\u000aI had a choice of three syrups and I went with the coconut syrup.  You also have the choice of getting whipped cream which I opted for.  Along the the whipped cream and the syrup comes a small container of almond butter which is very rich and very tasty!\u000a\u000aService was excellent.  Well, you'd expect it to be!  I was the only person in the place who wasn't an employee.  \u000a\u000aI really like the decor.  Modern with lots of wood.  On the wall near where I sat was a TV with the Cooking Channel playing and while I waited I watched Nigella's show and her making Jamaican jerk chicken.  It passed the short wait very pleasantly.\u000a\u000aI plan to go back soon and try their fois gras de canard.  A good choice for breakfast with quality ingredients.

VAfter my doctor's appointment this morning, I stopped here for breakfast.  The place opened recently and I wanted to check it out knowing that it was part of a chain.\u000a\u000aBefore looking at the menu, one of the bus people came and brought me coffee. I first checked the specials board.  Then I looked over the menu.  After some thought, I went with one of the specials and ordered a Cordon bleu skillet.  The skillet had potatoes, chicken, ham, and swiss cheese and Hollandaise.  I got my two eggs over easy and rye toast.\u000a\u000aIn less than five minutes, my server brought the skillet over and it looked great!  It also tasted that way.  The chicken pieces were real chicken--not formed chicken.  The swiss cheese covered the top.  I was pleasantly surprised that the skillet was not heavy on cubed potatoes to use a cheaper ingredient to cut back on the ham and chicken.\u000a\u000aMy coffee was refilled without waiting and service was good.  I'm glad we now have a good breakfast place in the neighborhood.

VThree of us, a biker, a runner, and a hiker, met for dinner last night (5/17/14).  The runner had made arrangements with the house for a tasting menu for the three of us with specific dishes included in the tasting.  More on that later.\u000a\u000aThe evening started with our dual appetizers of Torchon foie gras and Paté de Campagne Bourguignon. The paté and foie gras were excellent with some frisée served with them.  We each got two slices of bread on which to spread the paté.  \u000a\u000aFollowing this, we were brought escargots spätzle with chicken oyster, garlic, parsley coulis, and hazelnut.  The spätzle was soft and very tasty and the nut pieces for texture were a perfect addition.\u000a\u000aNext came a course of sea scallops on a bed of corn.  The scallops were cooked on point and this, too, was a very tasty dish.\u000a\u000aThe the Tunisian lamb chop with some merguez sausage with cousocus, lemon braised spinach, red pepper tagine, and some chickpeas.  The chop was excellent, perfectly rare, and the spinach was very good.  The sausage had a small bit of spiciness to it.  Another winning dish.\u000a\u000aFor the last main, we got the crispy duck confit with a petite onion ring, trumpet royale mushroom, and some swiss chard and a small turnip.  Excellent duck.  \u000a\u000aWe then went to our dessert course.  We had ordered 6 items--a cheese plate with 5 selections, raspberry clafoutis, black and white fondant, Gateau Basque, "Le Président", and Madeleines.  The five cheeses were: Pierre Robert Triple crème, Humboldt Fog goat, Petit Basque sheep, Pennsylvania Noble cheddar, and Fourme d'Ambert bleu.  The cheese plate was served with cranberry bread, nuts, and quince preserves.  The cheese plate was outstanding!  My favorites were the triple crème and the bleu.  I often buy Petit Basque so that was nothing new for me.\u000a\u000aThe desserts were quite good.  Standouts here were the Gateau Basque, "Le Président" and the black and white fondant with verbena ice cream. "Le Président" was a chocolate-hazelnut mousse tort and coffee chantilly.  The gateau Basque was a custard cake, brandied cherries, and vanilla Anglaise.   The texture differences of "Le Président"--the mousse tort with the bitter chocolate rings hiding the interior were wonderful together.  The gateau Basque was very smooth and quite a different cake than generally served.  With dessert, two of us had coffee and one had a single espresso.  \u000a\u000aThroughout the meal, the waitstaff was excellent.  There was a little hesitancy with one server as the restaurant has only been open for about three weeks.  I was brought a fresh glass of iced tea before finishing the one I had.  Water was refilled during the meal.\u000a\u000aThe only reason I didn't give the fifth star was the mixup in the tasting menu.  The runner had taken the lead in contacting the restaurant about a tasting menu.  After some conversation, a list was sent and approved for our group.  However, two of the things we had chosen were not served and one of the appetizers we got, the scallops, was not ordered.  Additionally, we were headed from our lamb right into our dessert course skipping over the duck confit--one of the must items on our list.  When brought to the attention of our lead server, a manager came over in a short while and told us the chef was preparing our duck.\u000a\u000aI know the restaurant has only been open a short time, but for a Daniel Boulud restaurant, when a menu has been submitted and agreed to, it should have been followed.  The serving staff was excellent.  The back of the house service needs some improvement.\u000a\u000aI hope to go back and let this place wow me again because the food is outstanding.

V17 of us met here last night for a six course tasting menu and it was a fantastic meal!\u000a\u000aWe started with rock shrimp tempura for an hors d'oeuvre.  They were pieces of shrimp fried and coated with a chili aioli that gave them a nice tang.  Great started.\u000a\u000aThe first course was a trio of good food.  We were served house smoked yellowtail, house smoked salmon, and Korean noodles on a bed of kimchi broth jelly (some spicy and part not) with seared beef.  This was absolutely superb!  The sauces on the two smoked fish micro greens and the fish were really very tasty.\u000a  \u000aFor the second course, we got an eggplant salad with grilled eggplant, grilled shishito pepper, micro greens, a cherub tomato and Moko dressing.  Very refreshing with wonderful flavors.\u000a\u000aOur third course was spicy chicken thigh stuffed with kimchi and sweet potato with a sweet and spicy sauce.  I'm running out of adjectives to describe the fantastic flavors in this dish.\u000a\u000aThe fourth course was 10 hour braised Berkshire pork belly.  The pork belly was marinated in soy sauce and cooked sous vide for 10 hours.  It was served with a cherry tomato, a kimchi crêpe, and black raspberry marinated sea salt.  If you look at the photos, you can see the sea salt on the plate.  Outstanding!\u000a\u000aThe fifth course was beef short rib with garlic and gratin.  The meat was so soft and had a marvelous taste.  Always, there's attention to detail in the courses of this meal.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, we had omiza crème brûlée.  Omiza is the fruit of an Asian tree that is used often for herbal tea.  It gave the crème brûlée a nice flavor.  We tried to decide what it most tasted like but there was no agreement.  \u000a\u000aService was outstanding.  The owner, Ryan, was a very busy guy last night but he was always gracious and explained each dish as he brought them to us.  At the end of our dinner, Chef Hong  came out of the kitchen and talked with us about his techniques and answered questions we had.  This was a great way to end an excellent meal.\u000a\u000aWhat an outstanding meal!

VThanks to Terri R., I know this place exists and they sell wonderful popcorn, something I don't usually buy.  Since I was going by today, I stopped to give it a try.\u000a\u000aI bought a small bag of Hot Stuff which is described as orange cheddar and jalapño and a small bag of La Famiglia--parmesan cheese, garlic, and onion.  I also got a small, complimentary bag of their mixed flavors.  \u000a\u000aI tried some of the mixed flavors and I had to open the Hot Stuff.  At first, I didn't think it was very hot.  Then the afterburners kick in and you taste the jalapeño.  \u000a\u000aWhile I may not be stopping here often, their product is great!  I wish I could get popcorn like this at the movies.\u000a\u000aAnd I'll end my review the same way as Terri--welcome to the neighborhood!
