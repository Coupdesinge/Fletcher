VOh my! I can't believe the poor reviews for this Hallmark! I am huge fan of this Hallmark, especially since it is located in The District. Whenever I come here I feel quite a bit more metropolitan, rather than just hum drum going to shop.\u000a\u000aThis store has always served me well for cards of all kinds. I am actually a card snob. If it isn't Hallmark, than it better be a beautiful card for my standards. I love Hallmark's collection of cards. \u000a\u000aI've come here for their Christmas cards for two years in a row. The cards are good quality and they always have a great selection. Also, you can always buy one pack of Hallmark cards and get the second for 50% off. \u000a\u000aThis Hallmark always sends me 20% for my holiday shopping AND coupons/discounts for my birthday.\u000a\u000aThe only thing about this store that I could possibly say is wrong is that it is quite small. However, they work their space well. \u000a\u000aOverall this is one of my favorite places to go in The District, and I go out of my way to come to this Hallmark and will continue to do so.

VI got my wedding dress here. This was a last minute addition to my bridal shopping list. Originally I was not going to go to David's. I was really put off by their "$99" dress deals. I thought the store might be a free for all with brides yanking dresses off of hangers and people just meandering around the place, but I was wrong.\u000a\u000aMy mother mentioned David's quite a few times when discussing dress shopping. So, it was for her mostly, that I made the appointment. I've seen others on here complain about coming here without one and being pissed when the staff said they could not accommodate them, or they were told they could browse and were snubbed by the staff... Well I just have to come at this with a different view as a bride who DID make an appointment:\u000a\u000aI'm glad the staff snubs those who do not make an appointment. Why? A few reasons...\u000a\u000a1. When you are a to-be-bride and you make an appointment you expect to be treated like royalty. I'm sorry, it's just the way it is. Here you are getting ready to spend hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars on a dress you are going to wear once. Plus you have probably brought friends and family with you, to look at you and oo and aa and smile and clap when you have selected "the one". As a bride-to-be I would have been pissed if there had just been random people here with no appointment taking away from MY TIME and MY DRESS SELECTION. \u000a\u000a2. The staff is paid on commission, obviously. They sell a dress, they make money. So WHY would they even want to deal with someone who is not there to buy a dress? Maybe if the store is devoid of anyone with an appointment, then yes, the staff should be helping those who have come without an appointment and who just want to have the fun of looking at wedding dress.\u000a\u000a3. Don't come to a freaking wedding dress store unless you are actually getting married, or you're going to prom, or whatever. If you're there just to browse - don't bother! Wedding dresses are put into plastic bags these days, the stores will not let you handle them or take them out. It preserves the integrity of the dresses. David's Bridal is not Ross. Wedding dresses are not meant to be played with.\u000a\u000aAs for MY appointment. First of my consultant was very sweet and nice. She was very helpful and although I sensed she was getting a bit frustrated toward the end of my appointment, I think she held herself together very well. However, when I came for my appointment she was still busy with a bride she was already working with. She had to split time between myself and this other girl for the first 20 minutes of my appointment. Also, my mother and bridesmaids were standing for the first portion of my appointment because the arrival of chairs for them took WAY too long.\u000a\u000aI'm not giving more than 3 stars mostly because of the first 20 minutes of my appointment, plus the store is a bit run down. I think they could certainly use bigger dressing rooms as well. They are way too small for two people, especially one person wearing a wedding dress.\u000a\u000aOverall it's okay. I never expected to get my dress here, but I did and it's gorgeous! Honestly, had we gone to the other bridal store first, I probably would have fallen in love with a dress there, and not come to David's. I think that's kind of the way it works. Unless a person is incredibly picky.\u000a\u000aSo overall David's is okay. I just hope things go well with picking up my dress, getting the bridesmaids dresses, and returning for alterations in July.

VAn update thus far into my wedding gown and bridesmaids gown experience with David's Bridal. Basically this is a downgrade update.\u000a\u000aTo begin with I did not mind DB's at first and went here as an "option" when I picked out my wedding dress. I just so happened to find my dress here. Therefore my bridesmaids are taking advantage of getting 20% off their dresses and we are coordinating the bridesmaids dresses here. \u000a\u000aAfter my first appointment, however, everything has gone downhill - fast. I am not going to write out a tangent of 14 paragraphs (which I could), but instead bullet point the continued problems:\u000a\u000a1. E-mails to me about arrivals of things such as slips, bras, etc. I am emailed when they arrive, then I call to make the appointment to pick them up and then I am called not once, but twice by the inept sales people here asking me when I am going to pick up. Annoying, inconvenient to me, and ridiculous. \u000a\u000a2. Seeing my personal "consultant" ONCE during the whole time I have picked out my dress, until now. If you're going to give me a personal consultant why aren't my appointments made to be sure she is there?\u000a\u000a3. Bridesmaids dresses have been a nightmare. The styles of the dresses my bridesmaids ordered were NOT put into their system. Therefore when my bridesmaids went back in to actually ORDER the dresses, they had no idea which ones they needed/wanted! Also, one bridesmaid ordered a dress, and it was wrinkly as F&^% when she got it. I get it, sometimes things get wrinkly, but really?\u000a\u000a4. All of my interactions with the people here (minus my "consultant" the FIRST time I went) have been forced and impersonal. \u000a\u000a5. When I went in to pick up my dress the lady who was helping me seemed incredibly irritated I had forgotten to bring my own slip and bra. Um, sorry lady but I have a lot of shit going on. See the ring on my finger? I'm a BRIDE and I have BRIDE SHIT TO DO. Not to go all "bridezilla" but giving me grief over such a mundane issue should not happen.\u000a\u000aOverall I gotta say DB's is not so good and I would probably recommended going somewhere else for your bridal needs. But now I'm stuck with them and I can't wait to be done with them.

VI am a fan of Trader Joe's, always have been since I first stepped foot in one outside of Berkeley, California in my Sophomore year of college. I was instantly in love with all the products, the amazing quality - the CHEAP prices!\u000a\u000aTrader Joe's is like your neighborhood store, except it's not Wal-Mart (YAY.) and it's l much smaller than Whole Foods, which I appreciate. I like to enjoy my shopping trips and not feel consumed by the store I am in. Often while I am at Whole Foods I feel a little uneasy because I have a hard time meandering through their multiple aisles not finding what I am looking for. TJ's is easy to navigate and set up much more like say, Albertson's or Vons. \u000a\u000aTheir products are wide-ranging and they offer things you will not find anywhere else. For obvious example: Cookie Butter. \u000a\u000aI also love when they are offering samples and pop up out of nowhere to allow you to try a new delicious cookie they happen to have that day. What's better than surprise cookie? Um, not much.\u000a\u000aTheir flowers are also pretty much the best you're going to find at any super markets/grocery stores AND the prices are rock bottom. I purchased a sunflower bouquet for $3.99 as opposed to Fresh & Easy who always sell theirs at at least $5.99 but usually more like $7.99+. On my last trip I scored an entire basil leaf plant for $2.99! Yes, that's super cheap, plus the basil plant was in perfect condition.\u000a\u000aI am going to start shopping here more often.

VBuffalo Wild Wings holds a special place in my heart because it is the place where my husband and I had our first date. I know, it's just magical right? It was not at this particular location, but I still think back to our first meeting whenever I go to BWW.\u000a\u000aThis location is located in the Galleria Mall Shopping Complex and tends to be busy and frequented by quite a few patrons on the regular. It has the same feel as any other BWW you will go into. Sports bar, good selection of beers, great menu items, and of course tasty chicken. Whether you like it on the bone or boneless, BWW is here for you.\u000a\u000aOn my husband and I's recent trip here we had indulged in boneless wings, buffalo chips with cheese and bacon, and cheese curds. To be noted these cheese curds are made with cheddar cheese, which is hard to come by in Vegas because typically most places use a white mozzarella. My husband is from Iowa, where they serve cheese BALLS (and they are always cheddar), so this was a great find for him. My boneless wings were a bit on the dry side though and they didn't have the Sam Adam's seasonal beer they had featured in the menu that my husband wanted. \u000a\u000aThe waitress brought me a tall beer instead of a regular, but said the bartender just accidentally poured that one and she figured she just bring me that one anyway but still charge for the regular, which was fine. She did ask us if we wanted dessert while we were barely into eating our meal, which was a little odd, but oh well. Service was a tad slow, but the place was kind of busy.\u000a\u000aOverall this BWW gets a solid 4 stars. I would obviously return.

VNever. Again. My fiance and I almost walked out on this place after we ordered our food. The service was deplorable and the wait staff is full of invalid excuses as to why it takes almost an hour to get food out to a dining room that had a total of 6 tables. "It's pretty hectic in here" was an excuse given to me by one of the waitresses. Sorry, I used to Bust. My. Ass. when I was a server at a Mexican restaurant and I got food out to 10+ tables faster than this place can serve one!\u000a\u000aI don't want to rag too much, because I did tell them I felt as though the service was sub-par. What could have helped the long wait? Simply our waitress coming to our table and at least checking on us once and letting us know the food was taking longer than usual. But that didn't happen. Then the table behind us asked for a manager and actually complained to them about the heinously long wait. Our waitress was nice, but not a good server.\u000a\u000aMy fiance and I were sat in a sparsely populated dining room and after we were sat - NO ONE ELSE CAME IN. No other tables were sat after us the whole time we waited around for our sub-par breakfast food, which came out luke warm by the way. How the hell can my food come out luke-warm when I've been waiting on it for 45 minutes?!\u000a\u000aI ordered the Southwestern Eggs Benedict, which is basically eggs benedict with chorizo sausage. It was okay. It came with some pretty bland country potatoes. My fiance got The Crepe Dealer, which came with eggs, two strawberry crepes, and a ham steak which he declared to be too dry to eat. He had about three bites and for my fiance that is very weird.\u000a\u000aStay away from this place.

VI really love Chipotle and I wanted this review to be better, but there are a few problems I had with my most recent jaunt to this particular Chipotle in Henderson. \u000a\u000aTypically I order the same thing all the time: Chicken Burrito, black beans, easy on the rice, cheese, a bit of sour cream, hot salsa, and lettuce. I will note that this incident has happened to me before at Chipotle, but this one was the most recent. It is when the people making it don't take care to make sure the ingredients are dispersed throughout the burrito. Sometimes I can deal with this, but the reason I was so disappointed in this particular case is because it was not even busy in the place so the employees had no excuse not to make me a perfect burrito, which is what I expect.\u000a\u000aI'll still return here if I'm in the area, but my favorite Chipotle in Las Vegas has got to be the one on Maryland Parkway directly across from UNLV. They are always nice, and consistently make me perfect Chipotle burritos. \u000a\u000aChipotle is awesome in and of itself. I love that the owners are dedicated to serving the freshest of fresh veggies, cheeses, and meats. (They even indicate in the store if they happen to be having problems with getting the meat as fresh as possible). I do wish Chipotle had a cheese sauce option like Qdoba does, but I guess that might be because it wouldn't hold up to their "freshest" possible standards.\u000a\u000aChipotle is definitely my go-to quick, Mexican burrito place in Las Vegas. They have locations pretty much everywhere and the food is good.

VI never know what I'm going to get. Eating at Kyklos is like taking a gamble, but I guess it's a gamble worth trying.\u000a\u000aOn a few ocassions I have eaten at Kyklos. Mainly these times have been when I am with my mother shopping it up at Galleria. I have gone through all of their salads and find them to be delicious, crispy, green, and fresh with all the right trimmings for what I would expect from Greek salads.\u000a\u000aI happened to see Groupon post a Greek food coupon, which doesn't come around too often and I jumped on it not realizing it was Kyklos. I only realized this after further inspection. Yesterday after work I headed directly to Kyklos to pick up some food to-go for my boyfriend and I. I have since learned - don't get it to go, just eat it there. By the time I got everything home it was quite smooshed and I was disappointed. Not their fault, but just the fact that gyros and fresh french fries should be eaten as quickly as possible once you have gotten them.\u000a\u000aI went with the gyro (supreme) and chicken gyro (for the boyfriend). Thinking of sides, I decided on the french fries and falafels. The sides were a major fail. The falafels were God awful. I just have no other way to put it. And the fries? Boring and tasteless. As for the gyros... hrmmm. I just can't say they were that great. These are supposed to be a staple, especially in a mall food court! It's the one thing you can grab and eat with your hand, rather than the salads and plates. My supreme was smothered in way too much feta. I felt like I had to power through it to get to the meat. \u000a\u000aIt's a Greek place in a food court, so I can't say it's terrible because I can't compare to a Greek restaurant where food would be expected to be better. But it's okay. That's all she wrote.

VThis is my update to Kyklos as I was contacted by the very, very nice manager in response to my disappointment I had with my Groupon and gyro experience. \u000a\u000aI have once again returned to Kyklos and I will return again and again when I am shopping at The Galleria. It honestly is the best place to eat in the food court. They take great pride in their food here and the staff is incredibly friendly. This time I went I once again had a gyro and this time I got my feta on the side. I highly recommend this as it lets you sprinkle the exact amount of feta as you eat. I also got the rice, which I thought would be simple, yet it was bursting with delicious tomato flavor!\u000a\u000aI must say Kyklos is kicking butt in the arena of mall food AND Greek food! Can't wait to try something else here.

VDuck tacos. Duck tacos. Duck tacos.\u000a\u000aI know, it's a pizza place, but duck tacos are the only thing I order when I come here. I find Sammy's to be hit or miss most of the time. Besides this location I have also been to the one on Sahara once. However, I spent a birthday dinner at this location in Henderson a couple years ago.\u000a\u000aBesides the duck tacos (I know I just confessed to only eating them) I have also had their pizzas. Well, of course I had to considering the place has "pizza" in its name. But alas, I have always come back to the duck tacos. I've never had them and not loved them.\u000a\u000aService is typically decent. I've never run into a down-right rude server, but some have been kind of stand-offish. \u000a\u000aThe place can turn into quite a family magnet during certain times of the day or on weekends. I usually go during off-hours when it's not as busy and I won't be bothered by large crowds.

VThe times I have been to Sport Chalet have been for some odd-ball reasons, mostly having to do with my husband wanting to go there to look at sporting equipment. The last time we went we were browsing for a bicycle for myself. I wanted to look at different styles and get a feel for what I wanted. I had already done some research online so really I just wanted to see the bikes in person. While we were looking two employees actually came up to us and chatted, which was nice. They both appeared to be knowledgeable about the merchandise.\u000a\u000aThe store offers a wide range of sporting equipment, some camping equipment, and sports clothing as well. I've browsed their tennis section - purchased tennis rackets last year, their golf section, and my husband and I have looked at their scuba gear, as well as looked into their classes for scuba diving. Yes, they offer scuba diving classes! You can become certified.\u000a\u000aOverall the store offers a lot for the sports-minded folks. If you need some type of equipment you can most likely find it here.

VTypically I don't shop at JCPenney unless I'm with my mother. I think JCP has lost itself to an older generation. You don't really hear too many 20-somethings saying, "Oh I got this at JCPenney" or "I shop at JCPenney ALL THE TIME!"\u000a\u000aNormally I think JCP is good around Christmas. They always have amazing sales and you can find really cheap kids toys here strangely enough, such as RC cars and helicopters. You can also find good stocking stuffers, especially for the older people in your family. I have also noted I can find cheap running shoes here as well.\u000a\u000aAs for their clothes selection I never find anything I like. Their junior/petites section definitely does not speak to me and the clothes, to me, all look pretty cheap and junky. I rarely find anything I like.\u000a\u000aThey do have a decent small appliances/kitchen section and if you get their catalogs/sales in the mail you can often find a pretty dang good deal on certain things. This past Black Friday I got 24 Lock-N-Lock storage containers for $19.99. Very cheap. \u000a\u000aThis particular JCP is lacking in customer service most of the time and often I find that the customer service people have problems running coupons or being able to point out where the deals that are being offered in the catalog are. Management could do their store a favor by training on the weekly/daily deals a little better. \u000a\u000aIt's an okay store, but it's really good for certain things. Just keep that in mind.

VUlta, Ulta, Ulta... \u000a\u000aI am always disappointed when I come here. Why do I keep coming back? I receive Ulta catalogs in the mail and I am usually intrigued by some of the products they have on sale. Their sales are GOOD. Just recently I received a catalog which had TIGI Bedhead items on sale for breast cancer awareness month.\u000a\u000aOf course - when I went to the store there were none to be found. "Limited quantities!". They must put about 3 of each item into each store because this is not the first time this has happened to me.\u000a\u000aMaybe if I could actually get some on sale items they boast so much about I would be back here to perhaps buy other things besides the on sale items. But really.... when I show up and the store NEVER has the items I drive out of my way for... \u000a\u000aThe store itself is much smaller than say, Sephora, with less selection. The employees often greet you, but I've never really been helped by anyone. It's not great, it's not bad, it's just meh.

VUsually my trips to VS are pretty lame. I go for their annual sales and grab and go not really looking at anything else. This trip was different because I went specifically to find a push-up bra for a shirt I plan on wearing to an event.\u000a\u000aI had my heart set on their "Very Sexy" Push-Up and immediately went to take a look at them. A nice young lady came over and told me about their promotion that day - buy any bra and you get a panty free! Hurray for me, since I was definitely planning on purchasing a bra. Next she asked me if I had been measured, and since I haven't been in awhile she went ahead measured me. Afterward I got the correct bra and headed to the fittings rooms. \u000a\u000aThe girl in the fitting room was very helpful and also gave me their "bra box" with a few other push-up bras in my size, but in different styles. I had a few questions about some of the bras and the girl was very helpful in telling me her experience with the certain bras I was trying on. I had also brought the shirt I wanted to wear the bra with and they let me try it on with the merchandise.\u000a\u000aAfterwards I went to pay and they did try to push a credit card on me (VS always does this) and I declined. Luckily she wasn't pushy about it and  even gave me a complimentary sample size bottle of their new perfume.\u000a\u000aThis was a fantastic experience and one I would recommended to any woman who is purchasing new undies/brassieres.

VWhat happened Mimi's? Was it the economy? Did you just get really bad really fast and I didn't even notice it?\u000a\u000aMimi's was introduced to me when I lived in Reno, NV during my college years. I tended to like the restaurant, although a bit pricey for a college student, I still indulged every once and awhile. Even though it was chain - it was quaint. But this Mimi's.... yikes, not even close to what I remember Mimi's to be.\u000a\u000aFirst off the place is so ridiculously loud it reminds me of being in my middle school cafeteria. Not even high school - MIDDLE SCHOOL. Loud, obnoxious, you have to yell across the table at your fellow diners. I could barely hear what my boyfriend was saying half the time we were eating. \u000a\u000aNext - food! Honestly I'd like to give the food 1 star, especially their selections. $1.99 to add on soup or salad? SHEESH. Come on Mimi's... is your soup and salad made from gold? I don't think so. I had the $10.99 lunch time special, basically I thought it was the only thing on the menu that was worth the price. It came with your choice of an entree and a soup or salad. I picked the French Onion Soup and the Brie Burger. I should have known better than ordering the Brie Burger. Brie is a delicious cheese, but done poorly it is tasteless and this was definitely tasteless. This burger was a catastrophe. TINY piece of brie, seriously, you can't even give me a big hunk of brie? You have to have a bunch of it to get the taste! Also, the burger was supposed to have dijon on it, which I thought would be an amazing addition. NOPE. They gave me half a shmear of Dijon. I could barely taste it! This burger should be ashamed of itself.\u000a\u000aAnd about the soup.... how dare you screw up French Onion soup Mimi's. This is the one place where Americans might extend their culinary desires and order some delicious "French" food. But no. You can't even do that right. A sad little crouton, barely any onions, and although the cheese was melted nicely on top there was NONE IN THE SOUP! Who does that? ARGH! \u000a\u000aLastly, the Mimi's in Reno (at least when I was there) were not stingy with the complimentary bread. Our waitress brought us THREE pieces of bread. There are two of us. WHY would you bring two people THREE pieces of bread? You can't even bring two of each? Two of the rolls and two of the brown bread? COME ON!!\u000a\u000aMimi's management must be cracking down on their servers here and the economy must be cracking down on Mimi's. From the experiences I used to have, compared to what it is now is just sad, sad, sad.

VI've been to this DSW on numerous occasions. I've purchased boots, running shoes, sandals, and even house slippers here. I've also bought socks and even a wallet on my past ventures. \u000a\u000aI think the store is well kept, bright and clean like all DSW's of course. I love the way DSW has their shoes at the level of your hip, so you can see the shoes clearly. \u000a\u000aMost recently my mother purchased a pair of Nike shoes for my brother for Christmas, but unfortunately it was the incorrect shoe. We took them back and the employees were more than happy to issue a refund with no problems. While we were there I bought a new pair of Rocket Dog slippers for $29.99. I love cheap shoes!\u000a\u000aI kind of flip flop about whether or not DSW truly deserves 5 stars, but so many of my trips here have ended in success with no problems that I feel I must say it is as good as it gets in shoe purchasing.

VRed Robin is and always will be a mediocre hamburger restaurant with a variety of appetizers. The entire menu is burgers, that's their thing. I guess you also have to mention they have the speckled lemonades and decent iced tea as well. \u000a\u000aMy last venture to Red Robin was because I was out with a friend in Henderson and we needed a place to grab lunch. Well, I hadn't been to Red Robin in awhile so we figured hey why not.\u000a\u000aWe arrived a bit after lunchtime so the place was pretty dead. We were seated fairly promptly and the service was good. Our waiter didn't mess up our order, he checked up on us, etc. \u000a\u000aI ordered a chicken sandwich. Honestly I can't even remember the name, but it was of the grilled variety. The only thing I can really say about it is I did not enjoy the super white breaded bun it came on. I just think I've become used to better slices of bread. I've become spoiled by other places I suppose. My friend ordered a chicken sandwich as well and I believe hers had some pineapples on it. \u000a\u000aTheir large steak fries were tasty and add a bit of variety to the meal. The waiter also asked us if we would like certain types of sauces to dip the fries in, which was nice of him.\u000a\u000aOverall the food was okay, the service was very nice and competent, the restaurant was clean, and so was the bathroom. They do have a bar at the back of this location. I didn't realize that came standard with Red Robin, but hey, it does.\u000a\u000aWould I be back? Hmmm. Possibly. But there are a lot of better places to get a burger in Vegas.

VI love my Jetta and I love VWs. Strangely enough, I also love this Findlay Volkswagen for their service department! \u000a\u000aI don't take my Jetta solely to VW for its check-ups and oil changes, but I have been here on a few occasions. The last time I went was for an oil change and to have new wiper blades put on. The last time I put new wiper blades on my Jetta I royally eff'd them up and had to take them to a small mechanic near my house to have them put on correctly. That being said I wanted nothing to do with putting on the wiper blades myself ever again. Therefore - have the service department do it! It only costs $40 (for the blades) and they do not charge you to put them on. Worth it.\u000a\u000aAs for the oil change I received a $29.95 coupon in the mail. Normally an oil change is about $70. Pretty pricey. Had I not got gotten the coupon I would have gone elsewhere.\u000a\u000aI left my car there and went to breakfast/shopping with my mom. They called me as soon as my car was done (took about 1 hour and 45 minutes). Overall it was a great experience and with car servicing that is hard to come by.

VI really hate to do this, but I need to update with my poor, poor experience at VW last week.\u000a\u000aMy boyfriend made an appointment because he has a new 2011 TDI Jetta and he had gotten a recall notice in the mail. We drive out here and I am expecting the great service I am so used to. Well, it was a mixed bag. First off the staff is still generally very nice (minus the girl who takes care of signing you out/giving you your keys... more on that later).\u000a\u000aAll right we drop off the Jetta and the maintenance guy asks my boyfriend if the car has had its annual check-up to which he replies it hasn't. Since the care is under warranty he decided to go ahead and get it done. This added an hour and a half to our already one hour wait time. We decide we might as well take the courtesy shuttle to Galleria Mall.\u000a\u000aWhile at the mall the maintenance guy rings my boyfriend and says there are actually two other recalls on the car that need to be fixed. My boyfriend says to go ahead and do them, so this puts our time to pick up at 1:15 PM (we dropped off at 10 AM). But it's okay because we have the courtesy shuttle come pick us up - right? No. Wrong. At 12:30 PM we called and asked to be picked up, the shuttle driver pretty much blew us off and told us he was on lunch and said our maintenance person could find us a ride. So, we called him.... and called him.... and called him... and he did not answer. We started walking, kind of out of boredom and kind of out of just wanting to be there, get the car and leave. \u000a\u000aSo the shuttle driver calls us about 1 PM and says he can come pick us up, so he does, on the side of the road. He apologized, but come on.... why didn't you find someone to come get us? Why doesn't VW have someone who can cover the shuttle driver during his lunch break? That's ridiculous.\u000a\u000aTo end our experience we're dropped off at the desk to sign papers and get our keys. While we stand there and stare at the girl running this operation. She staples papers. Continues to staple papers. Does not acknowledge us. Continues to staple papers. We're obviously WAITING FOR HER. Finally she stops, and comes over and plops papers for my boyfriend to sign in front of him and then practically (might as well have) tossed the keys to him onto the counter without so much as a smile or a well-wish goodbye. All I was thinking in my head was, "What a sour effing bitch." One should not work in customer service if you're going to behave in such a fashion.\u000a\u000aI'm not going to stop taking my VW to be serviced at a VW service station, but I just might have to try somewhere else in the valley after such a poor experience here.

VOkay I admit it. Sometimes I am a cheap-ass when it comes to certain things, but honestly I think I'm just being cleverly cost-efficient!\u000a\u000aMost 99 Cent only/dollar stores have that funk smell and they have that funk clientel. You walk in thinking, "Oh, here I go into the DOLLAH STOAH" $$$. Anyway. I brave through that feeling because I like to spend my money on things like sushi and handbags. Hence dollar store rummaging.\u000a\u000aHere are the things I have found that are worth buying at the dollar store:\u000a\u000aCleaning items\u000a- Toilet brushes\u000a- Toilet cleaner\u000a- Cleaners in general\u000a- Washrags/Dishrags/Hand towels for cleaning (not for nice presentation)\u000a- Car cleaners\u000a- Car Fragrance\u000a- Brooms/Mops/Etc.\u000a\u000aParty Supplies - Hey you know when you're going to have that party and you're going to throw away all the party crap because you're never going to use it again? Why pay so much for it!? Yes. I get party supplies at the Dollar Store. Sure, they don't have the biggest selection, but do you know how many awesome "Hawaiian" Luau themed parties I've thrown with dollar store stuff? Quite a few.\u000a\u000aSodas - Always cheaper than other grocery stores AND Wal-Mart. \u000a\u000aTupperware, One-time-use food storage containers, plastic cutlery, AND... AND!! Plastic bags, freezer bags, garbage bags, wax paper, parchment paper, cling-wrap, and aluminum foil.. YES. For one dollah! Holla holla! I realized how much I could save on these things by going to the dollar store. It's the SAME THING you would be paying $3+ for at normal grocery stores!\u000a\u000aSo that is my review of the Dollar Store. This one in particular is in a nice, convienent location. It actually is decently organized and the funky-smell is kept to a minimum. Sometimes it's crowded and you have to wait in line, but oh well.

VI'm a regular here! Bah.\u000a\u000aBoulder Station is a little less than 10 blocks from my house making it a less than 5 minute drive. I've been in this rinky-dink casino numerous times. I can't even count how many times I've been here. \u000a\u000aOut of all the Stations Casinos it's definitely on the "meh" side. I must point out though that they still treat their guests with all the "local love" you'd expect from a Station Caisno. \u000a\u000aThe downsides are: the smell, it's old, it's not in a very cool part of town, there's no good concerts, and the dining options are extremely limited. BUT the buffet prices are crazy cheap and the food ain't bad.\u000a\u000aIt's not a bad place, but I don't think it's good either. All in all it is what it is. Don't expect much and you'll enjoy yourself. Expect anything else besides "meh" and you'll be pissed you even stepped foot in here.

VThis place is small, located in the strip mall on Craig, next to the Pets Mart. After picking up some doggy items my boyfriend and I stopped here to grab some sandwiches to go on a Saturday afternoon.\u000a\u000aI went in to order while my boyfriend kept our four-legged friend busy outside where they have some tables set up for out-door eating. Um, too bad it stinks outside right around the area of the store though. Definitely not appetizing to eat sandwiches around a sewer-like smell.\u000a\u000aI have given Capriotti's a 5-Star Review before, but this was kind of "meh". I'm bumping it up to 3-Stars though because the Bobbie was yummy per usual. Unlike a lot of people, I'm not a regular at Capriotti's because I'm more of a Port of Subs girl for my go-to sandwich. However, Capriotti's hits the spot sometimes.\u000a\u000aThis location is tiny by the way and there's not much seating to speak of inside. Also, the set up to pay/get your sandwich/get your drinks is a little clumsy to say the least.

VPre-text: My husband and I had never been up this far in Henderson. The only reason we were up here was because we had been hiking at Sloan Canyon and we were both very hungry after our hike. Yay for Cap's!\u000a\u000aThis Cap's is located in a shopping mall in a very Western part of Henderson, nestled among golf courses, country clubs, and from what I could tell, rather expensive housing. It's a nice area. The Cap's is nice too, clean, with a long wooden counter and a bar to eat at. \u000a\u000aThe gentlemen working were very nice, clever individuals who continually yelled, "Hey, we got beer money!" whenever anyone tipped them. So, of course, I tipped them too. Good tactic.\u000a\u000aAs for the food, I ordered a medium Capastrami, which I looooove. The meat is so tender, absolutely amazing flavor. This is the way it is at all the Cap's in town. But this one may have been a tad better because I had just been on a hike. My husband got his go-to The Bobbie. \u000a\u000aWe got some drinks and a bag of chips and ate outside on one of their two tables and then we both ate the rest of our sandwiches at home for dinner! Ha! Thanks for two meals Cap's!

VThere are a lot of movie theaters in Vegas and I tend to frequent a select three. Green Valley is one of them. I particularly like this theater because it is situated in the perfect place. You can get to the theater without actually going through the casino, which I love. It has an entrance directly off of The District, which means it affords you the ability to have a lot of dining options if you want to do a dinner/movie. The casino's food court is also directly above the theater, which affords you a cheap, quick meal if you don't want to do a sit-down meal. \u000a\u000aThe theater itself is kept clean. It is on the small side, but I kind of like that about the place. You can usually catch movies here that have been out for awhile and you'll be able to watch it in a less than half full theater. \u000a\u000aI rarely go to the box office anymore to buy tickets since I buy them online, so my dealings with the staff are rare. However, whenever I've given my ticket over to the ticket taker here they have been congenial and happy.\u000a\u000aI would recommend this theater over many others in the Valley.

VOh snap, I just gave a 2-Star Review. Sorry, but I am not a fan of Ichiza. I realize many people will probably stare me down in disgust, but I will not be held to liking a place just because so many others do. Perhaps I am just not on board with the traditional Japanese dining experience this place supposedly offers. I am not a fan of the menu on the walls. Why can't I get a menu? They are hindering those of us who happen to have prescriptions, but sometimes do not like to wear our glasses for a night out, as was my case on the night I went here. \u000a\u000aI went with a friend for her birthday (and I was picking up the bill, hurray!). She had been here many times before me, so I let her lead the way. First off I was incredibly disappointed with their service from the get-go. They offered us a table, but let us know that the table would be needed in about an hour for a large party that was coming in. Um, okay, then why offer us the table? Why not put us on a wait list for a table that is not going to be needed? ANYWAY, we figured we wouldn't take over an hour to eat since it was just the two of us and we were starving, so we took the table.\u000a\u000aI had no idea what to order, and especially since I do not know Japanese food that well, the menu was a little scary for me. I mean, I am very apt to try things I've never heard of, but the server wouldn't even come around to explain some dishes. My friend ordered us a pretty decent salad. Something else that had a BUNCH of kimchee in it, which I quickly had a bite of and ignored. \u000a\u000aLastly, we ordered the Honey Toast dessert, which I absolutely adored and ate half of because I had had barely anything for actual DINNER. \u000a\u000aOh right - dirty silverware I had to have taken back and brought out to me, but waited for it for about 20 mins. This place is over-hyped and you can tell because it gets incredibly packed and very loud. The service is mediocre at best. All in all I would not make a return visit.

VI've only been to Meatheads once and it was for a show. My friend's band was playing a show and I always take time out to go hit up bars to listen to their music. I'm a huge supporter of local music.\u000a\u000aMeatheads is a small, skinny bar. At the end is where they have their concerts and they have comedy nights (so I've heard, but have not seen). It's in a strange location, in a large Wal-Mart shopping complex, shoved in between a Jamba Juice and a Panda Express. Makes me wonder if the bar had been there for awhile and then those chains just popped up later...\u000a\u000aAnyway, it's a nice little neighborhood bar. The bartender was attentive for the most part. However - the fact that this place hosts bands is just so weird to me. The tiny space just does not make is very conducive. BUT I still had a good time and maybe being crammed into such a small place had a little bit of charm, like "oh we're all getting in here to see this band and listen to the music and it's gonna be loud and in your face!".\u000a\u000aIt's a bit far away from where I live and I doubt I'd ever go back there just to have a drink and hang out. But if there was another band that was playing a show there I'd definitely go.

VCheap gas alert! Cheap gas alert! Cheap DIESEL alert!\u000a\u000aFellow Yelpers in Las Vegas who drive motor vehicles... This Circle K may have the cheapest gas in town. Plus they have incredibly cheap diesel. My boyfriend drives a Jetta TDI, which takes diesel and we went here yesterday to find incredibly cheap-o diesel.\u000a\u000aIt's in a skeezy neighborhood, you might be hit up for change by the somewhat sleezy folks hanging around outside, but if you're rummaging in your change jars for gas money this may be your best bet (outside of places like Costco).

VI've been a fan of Osaka for awhile. They've been around for awhile. They're a steady sushi spot. They've thrown in some new items as they've aged. The "bistro" part was only recently added, at least to my recollection they were once only known as Osaka. The restaurant, although in a seedy part of town, has been kept up well. I'm sure at some point in time, this spot was a GOOD spot in town. But you can't really help what happens to an aging city. You can help keeping your restaurant clean and nice looking, which Osaka has done.\u000a\u000aI enjoy the atmosphere of Osaka, it is dimly lit when you first walk in and around the tepanyaki areas. However, the dining area is well lit with nice, clean, wooden tables. The service has always been up to par when I have visited. The servers are well versed on the menu, they are around consistently to refill drinks (I usually always order a hot green tea). \u000a\u000aOn my last visit I went with a friend because I had a LivingSocial deal, which they honored without any hesitation. I had a few different items: Age Dashi Tofu. I thought it was pretty good, although I have had a better age dashi tofu at Cafe de Japon. The serving they give at Osaka is quite large. I shared some with my friend. The broth it was in was a teeny bit salty for me, but I did drink it all up. Moving on to sushi, because that's what I came for. I ordered the Lisa Lisa roll (shrimp tempura, cream cheese, avocado, eel sauce). It was decent. Not the best or worst roll I've ever had. The tempura was on the soggy side. Wish it had had a more crispness to it. Next: temaki (hand roll). I always get a hand roll when I eat sushi. I ordered the Miki's special, it's simple: crab, massago, and mayo. It was good. And lastly: nigiri. I ordered the sweet shrimp (Ama Ebi). This was my favorite by far. I wish I had just ordered a bunch of these. They were stuffed full, very generous portions. \u000a\u000aMy friend also allowed me to try some of the food she got. I unfortunately cannot remember what it was she ordered. But one thing was the Japanese pancake, which I really liked because it had seafood in it. \u000a\u000aWe ended our meal with the Bomba - chocolate peanut butter! I highly recommend this. It was very good. \u000a\u000aOverall I like Osaka. I will be back again. They have a very extensive menu and I would like to try more sushi as well as their Udon.

VI have never had a manicure before. \u000a\u000aI was feeling like I really needed to get my nails taken care of today and I have seriously been considering dipping my fingers into the manicure world. I just so happened to be on the Westside of town going out of my way to visit a few places I've been meaning to get to. So, as I was driving down Durango I decided to look for a nail salon. I happened upon More Than Nails, read Yelp reviews and decided hey why not!\u000a\u000aI was a walk-in on a Wednesday morning (about 10:45 AM) and there were two patrons and three people working. I was greeted and asked what I would like. Well, considering I'm a newbie I just stated I wanted a manicure. I was directed to select a nail color from the wall. I picked a pretty dark pink with a slight shimmer from OPI and was lead to start my manicure.\u000a\u000aIt was very pleasant and there was a movie playing overhead that I watched. The lady doing my nails was not very talkative, but very meticulous and nice. She seemed surprised I had never had a manicure done before.\u000a\u000aAt the end I had a bit of a surprise, my manicure had only cost $12 and in order to use a card here you must purchase a minimum of $15. I was pretty flabbergasted  and asked if there was anything I could purchase to push the amount of money up. Luckily they were able to issue me a $3 gift certificate. So, with my GC I plan to go back for a mani-pedi and I will make an appointment this time. \u000a\u000aOverall it was very nice. I am a newbie to all this, but I think my first experience was great. By the way, they offer a 10% discount for checking in on Yelp! I will partake of this offer later when I spend a bit more than $12!

VBoo-urns! I think maybe I've been spoiled by really, really awesome antique stores in Reno when I was in college because this place just looked like a dump-truck pulled in and shoved off a bunch of stuff from the 80s and 90s. I don't know about anyone else, but I'm just not interested in looking at (or buying) VHS tapes from 1995.\u000a\u000aApparently there are two Armstrong Emporiums, one on Main and another on Commerce. Supposedly the one on Commerce (just a block over) is supposed to bet better and bigger according to the owner.\u000a\u000aThis one though is just a mess. I mean the stuff is just piled on top of things and there's no rhyme or reason to anything. \u000a\u000aIf you want to go to an *antique* store and be able to actually find some gems I would suggest going somewhere else. If you want to browse around for awhile and possibly find something cool then this place may be up your alley.\u000a\u000aThere was an awesome chicken cookie jar there that I had my eye on. But when I looked at the bottom it said it was Made In China. I was hoping it was at least made in America, some kind of kitschy Americana item, but alas, it was China-junk I could get at Wal-Mart. Sad experience.

VI've taken an interest in my front yard. I never have before, but recently I was motivated to do so by my parents. I actually reside in my parents' home; my husband, brother, and I. I noted the lawn was quite.... burnt and yellow. Now, it is Vegas so not really surprising. However, it came to me one day that I wanted the lawn to look nice!\u000a\u000aAfter going to my nearest Home Depot and not finding anything I wanted I decided to come to Lowes. I looked online to see if Lowes had what I wanted (an aerator), but no. They did not have it. I opted for another tool which would do pretty much the same thing. I got fertilizer and gardening gloves.\u000a\u000aMy husband and I were not helped by any associates, but I liked Lowes better than HD. The gardening center was more shaded and less hot. There seemed to be a better selection of flowers. \u000a\u000aI'll be back to this Lowes for some pots for plants to put in my front yard when my grass becomes green. At least, I really, really hope the grass starts becoming green.

VLuv It is old school Vegas gold. It's a perfect spot to get a perfect creation - frozen custard. It's dessert so delicious and creamy, it just melts in your mouth and makes your taste buds tingle with pleasure. You must go to Luv-It. You will Luv-It!!\u000a\u000aMy husband and I ventured here on a boring 'ol weekday night we were having. When we arrived (around 9:30 PM) there was a line about six people deep in front of the window. I knew it was true - this place was gonna be GOOD. \u000a\u000aI ordered the Western, my husband got the banana sundae. We went with the regular (not the junior). At first I thought I had gotten too big of a cup, but then as I ate I couldn't put down my delicious cup of frozen custard. The melty caramel draped over the crunchy pecans and it mingled with the warm fudge. It was so, so, so good.\u000a\u000aThe bad thing is Luv-It is very close to where I live. Oy. There went a notch on my belt buckle!\u000a\u000aPS - Don't let the reviews about the "ghetto area" get you down and don't worry about coming here at night either. Just man up and do it. Honestly you will not regret your trip here.

VAll three of my stars go to the excellent, fresh, delicious taste of the carne asada, salsas, and guacamole. I can honestly say this place does have some great authentic tasting flavors. On the other hand....\u000a\u000aInstead of going inside I decided to slip through the drive-thru since there were no cars in sight. I'm guessing the place must have been bumping inside, because I did wait a LONG time to get my food at the drive-thru. Instead of getting tacos, I decided to go for the carne asada torta with a side of chips and salsa (holy crap, they give you a huge bag of chips btw). The lady over the intercom for the drive-thru was hard to hear, and I know she was asking me if I wanted all the extras on my torta, well hell, I said yes - but be warned you will get an extra charge! However, it is worth it.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately my torta was mooshy-mooshed by the time I got home! :( Not all of it mind you, but a good portion of the bread had just soaked up the guac and juicy meat leaving a messy bread pile wrapped inside of foil. I did salvage a majority of it though. The salvaged part was delish! So word of warning: do not get the torta to go, especially if you got all the extras put on it. And note: I only live about 5 minutes away from this place, so it's not like I had to drive 15 mins home with it sitting in my car.\u000a\u000aLastly, I must say even though they gave me a ton of chips, they were cold! Even Taco Bell serves me warm chips through the drive-thru window! *sigh* So, when I got home I warmed up the chips and they were very, very good and SALTY! Mmmm. Plus they gave me a TON of pico de gallo for dipping, but I don't like cilantro. I opted to dip my chips in the SPICY red sauce they gave me with my torta.\u000a\u000aThis place is authentic and it is incredibly popular. Unfortunately my experience was not-so-good. I do want to go back and try the tacos though! And next time perhaps I will dine-in instead of hitting up the drive-thru.

VSo I like to review places a couple times. Usually if I've had a good experience two or three times I simply allow my reviews to stand as is. Therefore I had to give Los Tacos another review based on my most recent experience.\u000a\u000aOnce again I went through the drive-thru. I will offer this information: in the drive-thru they can't see you and by that I mean you will most likely be greeted in Spanish (even if you don't know a lick of it). But no worries, I placed my order in English and there was no problem. I decided I wanted to try the carne asada taco and carnitas taco. I have heard the carne asada is superb here.\u000a\u000aHere are the pluses: the tacos are BIG and very filling. However, I was disappointed in both of the meats. First off the carnitas were very, very fatty. I kept getting big globs of fat, not just little pieces here and there. The carne asada was better, but salty. Very salty. The salt was overpowering the natural flavor of the meat.\u000a\u000aI've kind of had mediocre experiences at Los Tacos while my experiences at Tacos El Gordo have rated higher. Since they're both in the same parking lot I think my business is going to go to El Gordo from here on out. \u000a\u000aOh, but I will give them this awesome plus: their beans are perfectly cooked and tasty and not refried beans! A very refreshing difference from the refried variety.

VThis Big 5 has been around forever. I'm 29 and it has been here as long as I can remember. Being that they are pretty much the only sports-type store on the East side I imagine that is what has kept them in business.\u000a\u000aThere are no Dick's, Sport Chalets, or any other big-box sports retailers in the area. \u000a\u000aThe store itself is small, cramped, and crammed with merchandise. I walk INTO clothes and sports equipment and racks of weights here -- because there is nowhere else to go, but into them and THEN around them.\u000a\u000aIt is really CRAMMED with merchandise, every spare corner is filled, the floor where all the clothes are situated leaves no room to maneuver.\u000a\u000aThe GOOD thing is they have sporting good, clothes, and shoes at SUPER discounted prices. Also, going here saves me from having to make an hour+ long trip to Henderson or the South side of town for sporting goods.\u000a\u000aThey do not have everything and they may not be the "nicest" place. But it will do.

VI've now been to this X.O. Liquor twice as it is the closest liquor store to my house. No, I am not a booze hound! The first time I needed banana liquer for cupcakes I was making, but unfortunately they were all out, although the employee there was nice enough to look around and even make a suggestion for 99 Bananas. I didn't want the people eating my cupcakes to get totally smashed though, so I opted out of that one.\u000a\u000aHowever, this past Super Bowl Sunday I was in need of Chambord at a last minute decision to put the delicious liquor into my margaritas I was making. Lucky me, they had Chambord, for a decent price and also offered the smaller size bottle and the bigger bottle. I opted for the smaller one.\u000a\u000aStaff is always friendly and helpful. It is in a kind of skeezy area right off the freeway. But just power through that area into the store. Oh PS - I would NOT come here if it were not light out and NO I am NOT joking about that fact.

VI've been to this Home Depot a bunch of times recently because spring has sprung! And guess what... in Vegas there is only so much time between winter and summer. I do not want to be outside doing yard work during the summer, so from now until probably the middle of April, it's yard work time.\u000a\u000aMost everything I've gone to get here has been in the garden/nursery section because my fiance is redoing the backyard with rocks. So we needed a new wheel barrel, shovel, weed killer, etc. \u000a\u000aEvery time we've been here we've been able to find what we needed. Also, there are pretty competent employees who can help you find something and give you advice for something you might have a question on. \u000a\u000aIt's a decent place, but I don't like the groups of people outside in the parking lot looking for work. However, I think there's going to be that problem at pretty much any Home Depot or Lowes.

VHonestly I would expect more out of such a highly rated restaurant AND a Zagat restaurant as well. I think the night we came was jinxed or something because my experience here for a friend's birthday was not terribly good.\u000a\u000aFor starters we had a party of 6, which increased to 7 unexpectedly, but it was fine, we all just squished a bit closer to each other. The restaurant did have a table set up for our reservation when we arrived, so that was a good start. The ambiance of the restaurant is relaxing and the noise level while we were there was perfect. In fact, I think we were probably the loudest out of the whole place.\u000a\u000aService - It was all over the place. We had two people taking our orders and I think that is where things got weird. We had a friend who came, but needed to leave early so she ordered her food before the rest of our part had even arrived AND she ordered it to go. Somehow between our two servers that was turned into "She wants an order of shrimp chow mein AND an order of shrimp chow mein TO GO". Luckily we were able to nip this mistake before it actually happened. And although our servers were attentive, the service was S-L-O-W. As in plates of food came out one or two at a time and there was big chunks of wait time in between people's food arriving. It's one of my biggest pet peeves when a restaurant cannot get a whole party's food out in a decent amount of time. Members of our party sat without food for a good 7 to 8 minutes while others were almost halfway through their own plates. \u000a\u000aFood - I had the Kang-Ped Delight with Beef (err, actually with 5 pieces of beef). Although it was really good, I did enjoy it, I was missing the beef! The curry was spot on and their rice was sticky yummy. As always I also had a Thai iced tea and theirs is spot on. Creamy and milky, yet refreshing and served in a very cute glass. I also sampled from the "Combo Appetizer Plate" that our group got. I had the BBQ pork, very good; and an egg roll - also good, especially dipped in spicy mustard! We all also shared the fried eggplant, which I felt was okay, nothing special. The ice cream served for my friend's birthday was kind of funky, and I felt as though it was freezer burned. Meh. \u000a\u000aOverall - Honest to goodness I don't think I'll be coming back. The lackadaisical service to my friend's birthday party was pretty off-putting. Maybe they're just not good with big groups? I have no idea. BUT I can get Thai food at a lot of places in Vegas closer to my house. So, unless I'm *invited* to Komol again I doubt I will return.

VYou evil, awful Monopoly, cash-grubby company.\u000a\u000aCurrently have the "bundle" offered by Cox. Phone, Internet, and Cable. First off, why doesn't Cox offer a decent combo of Internet and Cable these days? NO ONE has a land-line anymore! Get with it Cox, the land line phone is DEAD.\u000a\u000aInternet is mediocre. And when I'm paying this much for Internet, it better not be mediocre. Every morning about the same time my Internet mysteriously disappears. It also happens once or twice a day - just no Internet. I've called Cox and they've had me restart my router, restart my computer, etc - but no help. They have told me before that perhaps the problem is MY router, hm, no Cox... maybe the problem is YOU.\u000a\u000aMAIN REASON I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW:\u000a\u000aA few weekends ago I was having a party. This party was to celebrate the UNR vs UNLV game which was being broadcast on one of the public Cox Cable Channels. The newspaper had stated for about a week that the game would be broadcast on that channel. So, I have a ton of people at my house and we are having a good time and it's time for the game.... um, what is this? This is not the game, where is the game? I look to make sure the time is right, I switch channels, I switch it back, I look in the paper.... yes, no? WHERE IS THE GAME?! At this point I have 15 people and no football game. I call Cox:\u000a\u000a"Excuse me, why isn't the UNR vs UNLV game being broadcast?"\u000a\u000a"Oh, we're sorry, we're having technical difficulties trying to get the game up. It will be up shortly."\u000a\u000a"Oh okay, thank you." *hang up*\u000a\u000aSuddenly - GAME APPEARS! Except..... there's no sound and it looks like it's being shot with a freaking 8mm camera!\u000a\u000aI AM ENRAGED. I call Cox again, while at the same time my friends have turned on the radio (where the game is being broadcast) so we can watch the TV/listen to the game.\u000a\u000a"Yes, hello... I just called about the UNR vs UNLV game? Well, I have picture, but there's no sound."\u000a\u000a"Oh yes, we're sorry, but we're only getting visual right now. We're working on it."\u000a\u000a"Oh, do you have an idea of when it will be up? Because we're listening to the radio and watching the TV."\u000a\u000a"Well, we really don't know... (silence for some reason). However, ma'am if you would like you can switch over to ESPN3 where the game is being broadcast right now."\u000a\u000a"Umm, I don't have ESPN3 on my package. I thought you guys were broadcasting this game? It's an important game. The papers said you would be broadcasting it! How can it not be running right?!"\u000a\u000a"Ma'am, I'm sorry, but like I said, if you'd like we can bill you for $25 to watch the game on ESPN3...."\u000a\u000a"EXCUSE ME? CAN YOU REPEAT THAT? YOU WANT ME TO PAY $25 TO WATCH A FOOTBALL GAME.... IN MY HOUSE? THAT YOU SAID YOU WOULD BE BROADCASTING?!"\u000a\u000a"(stupid customer service agent apologizing and doing NOTHING)"\u000a\u000aSo I hung up and we watched the game until HALFTIME when miraculously (amazing how it happened), all of the sudden when the commercials came back AFTER HALFTIME the game was back on and completely different!\u000a\u000a#1 - Sound\u000a#2 - No more 8mm, grainy looking shit-show\u000a#3 - ESPN3 logo in the bottom right corner.... hmmm?\u000a\u000aYes, those bastards tried to swindle people into buying that game because they KNEW people wanted to watch it. So they held out on doing what they said they would do until halftime, which is broadcast a football game. They're awful, evil people and I hate them.

VThis Coach Store always, always, always has a ton of people in it. It does not matter what day, what time, what holiday, etc. It is always packed, no matter what. I guess the slashed prices on their purses will have that effect on people. \u000a\u000aI have been here on countless occasions. Most recently I went in search of a new handbag and succeeded in my journey. I bought one of their new bags and used the 20% coupon given to me upon entering. They ALWAYS give out the percentage coupons. I've never been in here when they haven't.\u000a\u000aIt is what it is. If you go in, make sure to expect the hustle-bustle of a bunch of people and be forewarned: there may be lines you have to wait in. If you can just take it easy and not get irritated it's a great place to get a cheap purse. After all, Coach really isn't all its cracked up to be these days with many other designer purses pulling ahead of them in the game. Still, I like them for what they are - a designer purse anyone can have.

VI was expecting to be giving Joey's Pizza more stars, but based on my husband and I going out of our way to "try something different" - that different did not turn out so great.\u000a\u000aI've had this place bookmarked because of the good reviews and proximity to my home. There's not a lot on the East Side worth going out of your way for, but some things are really diamonds in the rough. Joey's is not.\u000a\u000aOrdered three medium pizzas for $21.99 for take-out. The girl on the phone took my order and repeated it back to me.\u000a\u000a1 Pizza with hamburger topping\u000a1 Pizza with ham and mushrooms\u000a1 Pizza with pepperoni and jalepenos\u000a\u000aWe got two pizzas correct and the other came as a HAWAIIAN pizza. They put pineapples and ham instead of ham and mushrooms. Okay, it's an honest mistake, but I've ordered this type of pizza from Marco's, Domino's, Metro, Pizza Hut, and Little Ceasers, and never have any of them eff;d it up. \u000a\u000aMaybe I could over look the wrong pizza, but then when it comes down to it, the pizzas were just "meh". The cheese was boring, no diversity, just straight out mozzarella, and gooey-gross messy. The first time around it was okay, heated up the next day it was particularly yucky.\u000a\u000aAlso - I got a bad stomach problem that night and woke up *ahem* having to go to the restroom. I spent the rest of the night in and out. I decided it must have been the pizza, but my husband did not get sick. Then I decided to experiment and took all the pepperoni and jalapenos off the pizza I ate and had it sans-toppings. I did not get tummy trouble after that.\u000a\u000aWho knows - the sickness may have been something else I ate, but considering the meh quality, the wrong pizza, and my late-night bathroom ventures, I will not be ordering from Joey's Pizza again.

VI hit up this B&N quite often with my fiance because of his need to look at books pertaining to flight, airplanes, and military warfare. Although he never purchased books here. Only looks through them and then buys them on Amazon once he's decided he actually wants the book. Can't blame him because I do the same thing. Usually I'll snap a pic of a book with my phone so I can add it to my Amazon wishlist later on. On occasion I will actually buy a book if I'm feeling overzealous and I have some extra cash on me at the time.\u000a\u000aFor the most part the store has always been tidy and well set up. I've never been approached by an employee for help, other than the cashiers, who are typically friendly. But the one thing I dislike about B&N is their constant nagging to get the card. Every. Time. I mean come on. Plus I always have to tell them I already receive their email updates each time I buy something here.\u000a\u000aI do enjoy their cards and stationary selections. On my last visit they had some Parisian themed cards/stationary which I could not resist buying because my wedding has a Paris theme to it. \u000a\u000aThing about B&N is the books are always going to be more than buying them on Amazon, but I guess sometimes you just want to go to a bookstore and actually buy a real life book, in your hands, and flip through it before making the final decision to buy. That is something you cannot to on Amazon.

VWhen I was in college I dined at Chili's often - often enough to have sampled almost everything on their menu. I hadn't been in awhile, but all the staples are still there - out-of-control burgers with lots of toppings, the ribs, a few scatterings of fish dishes, one pasta dish, and of course, the appetizers and my favorite - the chicken crispers. \u000a\u000aThis Chili's was super packed when my boyfriend and I showed up on a Friday night. Luckily, we were able to snag a two-person booth quicker than the said wait-time of 25 minutes (yikes!). Anyway, we were seated and greeted by our waitress who was pleasant, but seemed a bit overrun and busy. However, being a Friday night at Chili's what else is there to expect? I ordered a Stella and a water, while my boyfriend went for a Sam Adams draft.\u000a\u000aFor some reason there wasn't much on the menu that was enticing me. I thought about going for the ribs, but ended up ordering a new addition to the menu, a twist on the chicken crispers - honey chipotle chicken crispers. Well, this item was somewhat of a let-down. The crispers were much more sweet than I imagined them to be. I was thinking something with a spicy kick, but not so. Of course they gave me a heaping amount of fries and the corn on the cob, which was good.\u000a\u000aMy boyfriend's fajitas looked much better than my meal. He got the trio, with shrimp, chicken, and steak. I did try a few bites, and the shrimp was a tad over-cooked, but the chicken and steak were very good.\u000a\u000aOverall this place is great for families (there was even a person running around making balloon animals) and it's just like any other typical Chili's. I found no huge problems with the service or the food, but it's simply another neighborhood Chili's.

VYikes. I will never be returning to this sushi place even if it is the closest one to my boyfriend's place. I would much rather trek somewhere else.\u000a\u000aI got a Groupon for Yoko based off the fact it was close to my boyfriend's house. The Groupon was for $30. Originally I had planned on just ordering a few rolls that my boyfriend and I would split because he's not huge on sushi. He's more of a Cali Roll and "I'll try it, but won't like it" sushi eater while I'm the "I'll eat anything and probably like it" sushi eater. Therefore doing an AYCE typically isn't the best idea. However, the girl sold it to us because with the Groupon it would be like a buy one get one. Wish I hadn't done it.\u000a\u000aFirst off, the AYCE here is $25.99. Look, I'm not cheap, but if I'm going to pay $25.99 for anything it better be good quality and the sushi here is not good quality. The fish was okay, it was the preparation that was inconsistent and poor. Half of our rolls were terribly put together. Every time I picked one up the rice would fall off. There were a few pieces that didn't even have fish in them. The only rolls that looked like they had any time put into them were the specialty rolls. Also, the nigiri was kind of warm. Freaks me out when my fish is on the verge of being warm.\u000a\u000aThe ambiance is nice, the seating around the bar was as well. They were playing some top 40s music and there was a decent amount of people there, but I won't be back, even if they do offer another Groupon.

VIt's not bad, but it's not great either. But it's convenient for me. \u000a\u000aNot  the best selection of dog bowls/watering dishes. However, they do sell Nutro, which is what I feed my dogs. Sometimes you can get really good deals on BIG bags of dog food. You can never have too much, I think.\u000a\u000aThe parking lot is usually a mad house though and I'm a little weary of letting my pups out in the lot, even if they are leashed.\u000a\u000aSo it's nothing special. Just a PetsMart.

VI don't go to this Smith's very often, but when I do it serves as an okay place to grocery shop. I guess I tend to hit up this Smith's when I happen to be getting Wingstop, which is located right outside the parking lot. \u000a\u000aThe produce section is nice, pretty well setup. The artisan bread section is awesome. I love that it's enclosed behind the plastic windows and you can open it up and choose which bread you'd like. They're all baked fresh daily.\u000a\u000aThe only real complaint is the clientele of this particular Smith's. The poor store is in the ghetto so the people shopping there are less than desirable. I guess it's not as bad as shopping at Wal-Mart though.

VI guess I can't write a stellar review of KFC since I really actually don't like KFC in general. Honestly I'm pretty sure their chicken is some mutated, deformed chicken raised to be torn apart and shoved in buckets.\u000a\u000aHowever, my family loves KFC and I am subjected to it. I'm not against eating it, I just wouldn't do it without having someone else purchase it for me. Their chicken is meh, mac and cheese meh, coleslaw okay, and they really are lacking in their sides department. Is it just me or did they used to have more variety? I believe the last time I was there you could actually select a salad as a side, but apparently that is no longer an option.\u000a\u000aThe only thing I like at KFC is the mashed potatoes and gravy. Don't know why, but something about the salty balance really gets me.\u000a\u000aThis KFC is pretty well taken care of, service tends to be mediocre, but nice. It can get busy at dinner time for sure. Today we went there and my mother swore up and down she saw an advertisement for a special KFC was offering on TV and asked for that special. This particular store would not honor it, so I'm not sure what that's about.\u000a\u000aIn conclusion - no thanks KFC! I'll get my fried chicken fix elsewhere!

VJust keep driving and hit up IHOP, it's literally 30 seconds away from this Denny's.\u000a\u000aI am actually a Denny's fan. When I am in the mood for something that is full of calories and eggs that are stuffed with meat and cheese, Denny's is a good place to come. It's great for eating after you've been drinking and it's good for a breakfast, just because you want to have a huge Grand Slam breakfast.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately this Denny's is really sub-par, and I know, I know - it's Denny's! But still. The place is always super crowded and the waiters always seem on the verge of having mental break downs. They often forget items or don't have the food brought out correctly (ie: my boyfriend always orders things without onions and here they always manage to leave them on). \u000a\u000aPlus, I think Denny's is over-pricing its food now-a-days. Unless you go for their specials such as the breakfast slams you might as well go eat somewhere else and get better food for a better price. I paid $9.99 for an "okay" buffalo chicken sandwich. When I pay almost $10 for a sandwich, I want it to be spectacular. \u000a\u000aJust not worth it.

VRecently my husband and I decided to switch veterinary offices. For a few reasons our previous vet was not working out - mostly because of how far away it was from our home and it was a bit on the pricey side.\u000a\u000aLuckily this vet is not far from our house at all, which makes for an easy 6 or 7 minute drive. Overall I am very pleased with this vet so far. They have a place to make appointments online (yay!), but the receptionists are very helpful a nice over the phone and in person. The hospital itself is quite large and has a "cat" and "dog" entrance. The space was clean and the room we took our lab in was also clean, although a bit cold (dang, they were pumping the AC while we were there!).\u000a\u000aWe were given a doctor (can't remember his name now), but he was very, very good with our pup. He sat down on the floor with him when he examined him. This doctor also specifically called to check up with us a few days after our visit.\u000a\u000aOverall I am very pleased and I am giving a 5 star review. I hope it will not go down in future visits.

VHi, um, have you had their cheese curds? Because if you haven't you are missing out on a tiny piece of heaven - in your mouth! Seriously though, Big Dog's knows how to deliver tasty bar-food, especially in the form of deep-fried cheese. Hey, if I'm going to down tasty beers brewed locally I'd like to pair them with the most unhealthy thing possible, thank you very much.\u000a\u000aThe Big Dog's is located on the east side, on Nellis, just a jaunt from Nellis AFB (therefore offering a nice selection of good to look at Air Force men folk if you arrive at the right time). They also have an aaawesome happy hour. Including reduced prices on their brews as well as their pitchers! \u000a\u000aOn a recent jaunt to this bar I had the "Holy Cow!". Very tasty! And I had their fried-steak sandwich. Oh it was good - it was basically a chicken fried steak on a bun, with a delicious pepper seared on it, with cheese and lettuce, tomato, and pickles. OH BONUS - it comes with an avocado spread! Yes, I think I'm in love with this sandwich. \u000a\u000aI love Big Dog's and I have for YEARS. This place has been open in Las Vegas since I was tiny little kid and my parents took me here. It is an institution you have to visit if you're in Vegas. Go to Big Dog's, enjoy the smokey-waftiness as you walk in, ignore it, and continue in - and then sit down for a perfect bar-food, beers kind of night!

VUpdate time for my beloved Big Dog's. Can you tell I'm an East Side gal and just can't get out of my comfort zone? Haha. So many places in Vegas on the west side of the valley I'd like to try, but I'm just too lazy and my Jetta just won't make the drive. Tee hee. \u000a\u000aWent to Big Dog's for a big hearty breakfast (and military discount). The place had the smell of Saturday night still lingering in it when my parents and I arrived at about 10:00 AM this morning, on a Sunday. But I don't let things like that stop me, it is a bar after all. I guess that smell probably indicates a rocking Saturday evening so can you really fault the place?\u000a\u000aI had an omelet (make it your own way), and I got ham, cheddar cheese, and jalapenos. The thing is massive. I only ate half of it. They did not skimp on the fillings which was nice. Plenty of ham, plenty of 'penos. Came with a ton of hash brown (slightly crispy, slightly softly potato-y), and an English Muffin (or toast). My Mom got the "Double Down" breakfast: two eggs (your way), hash browns, your choice of bacon or sausage, and your choice of bread. Mum said is was good. Dad got the morning's special: Pumpkin pancakes! They were as big as my head!! And you get three of them. I tasted them and I thought they were good, but seriously, too sweet for me to eat for breakfast (then add maple syrup and you might as well be having Pixie Stix on a plate). But still - a very nice surprise and well executed for a bar!\u000a\u000aService was a little iffy. Our server seemed a little out of it, not totally sure of what she was doing, but still nice enough. She got the food out and kept our coffees filled. Guess you can't ask for too much more than that.\u000a\u000aAlthough not a 5-Star experience, it was still good! I like Big Dog's for drinking beer and having bar food better, but if you're on the East Side and you need a BIG breakfast for cheap this is a good place to hit up!

VRecently went here to get my car's oil changed. I went on a Tuesday morning so the place was not busy at all. I mean, if it's possible for you to get your car's services done on a weekday, it's always better in my opinion.\u000a\u000aThe place is kinda run-down, but the service was quick enough for me. In fact, it barely took the kid 30 seconds to see I was waiting. A nice older gentleman also informed me my air filter should be changed. I knew they were going to say that so I said to go ahead and do it. He also filled up my tires as well.\u000a\u000aThe service took just about 30 minutes. Really quick and all the workers were professional and nice. My car has been running perfectly fine (it's been two days since I got it done). Bonus - you also get a free car wash when you get services done here.\u000a\u000aNo complaints from me!

VI like it. I do. Just not a whole lot.\u000a\u000aHit up this PT's just a few nights ago for an outing with coworkers. We all arrived shortly after 9 PM on a Tuesday night. There were a few patrons at the bar, but other than that the place was empty. It does indeed have a smokey smell, but it looks really clean and new. There are definitely nice place to sit around tables on couches. The bar area is large a well-lit. There are pool tables and a beer pong table.\u000a\u000aMy friends and I mostly came for the beer/drinks. We sat at a table near the billiards section as many in my group were playing pool and beer pong. \u000a\u000aI was starving, so I actually had to eat. I selected the Jalapeno Sliders, that come with three mini burgers and some french fries. They were quite tasty, not greasy, not overly done. The jalapenos gave them a nice kick. They were good - but everything on their menu seems pretty pricey to me for it being bar food. My sliders were 9 bucks! I don't mean to be a cheap-skate but usually when I see a bar menu there's *at least* a few items around $5-$7. But not on PT's menu.\u000a\u000aOverall I'd come back if I were hanging out with coworkers and this was their choice. But I doubt I'd be back just because I felt like it.

VMy boyfriend and I recently added a black lab puppy to our growing pack of dogs. Actually, our little Jake will be the last doggy for awhile. So with one growing puppy and two mixed chihuahuas we need a good vet.\u000a\u000aAmerican Pet Hospital does two things: takes care of animals and humans well. Jake has been since he was brought home at 3 months. He has been for numerous shots because unfortunately he had kennel cough and worms AND THEN tape worms. However, no fear! The vets here have taken very good care of him. He does not whimper or shy away. He whines a bit, but he is a puppy.\u000a\u000aThe staff and the vets are animal lovers to the core, you can tell. They are always smiling and handling the animals with care. You really feel the warmth here. :)\u000a\u000aI'm so happy to have found such a wonderful animal hospital. It's a bit far from our home, but I am more than willing to make the drive to Henderson.

VIf you're on the East side and you're hankering for a sandwich, but you don't want to go the route of a chain, then Bob's is here for you!\u000a\u000aLocated in a business park off of Patrick Lane, Bob's is an unassuming joint. There is a sign leading the way for you though, so do not be afraid of the business-like exterior. Inside is a no-frills sandwich shop bringing you cold and hot sandwiches alike. Tables and chairs scream community kitchen, but do no be afraid, go ahead and order a sandwich. \u000a\u000aI went with the simple cold, turkey, cheese, and salami with everything. Lettuce, tomatoes, and red onions. Also comes with mayo, which by the way, you should probably ask for light mayo if you are watching your figure, OR if you just don't want to have an over-slathering of mayo on your sandwich. Next time I'm there I'll opt for the lighter option. Other than the mayo the sandwich was great. Just enough meat and cheese and fillers in my opinion. There wasn't one prominent part of the sandwich. The bread was also incredibly soft making for a great texture wrapped around the meat, cheese, and veggies.\u000a\u000aMy husband went for the French Dip, while on the smallish side, he said was good. We also shared a bag of chips.\u000a\u000aBob's is simplistic. Sandwiches. Chips. Salami. Cheese. Bam. Bam. Bam. Don't expect any crazy aioli sauces or fancy-pants toppings for your sandwiches here. \u000a\u000aI'll be back when I'm in the mood for a good deli sandwich.

VWhat is wrong with gas stations these days? We aren't paying them enough money for their gas and their over-priced goodies? I'm not even complaining about gas prices. Originally I thought I was going to get a great deal at Breez Right In... but oh no, they sneakily screwed me. How considerate of them!\u000a\u000aI looked up cheap gas prices on Gas Buddy, my app on my phone. Usually it leads me to the cheapest gas in my area, and this time it showed me Breez Rite In, with Regular Unleaded at $3.29. I was pretty stoked to be paying under $3.30 per gallon so I zipped on over. Per usual I checked their MAIN GAS SIGNAGE for the price (you know, the big one all gas stations have?) and it said $3.29. Sweet deal, I thought. I also searched for a Credit/Debit card fee and saw no signs noting it.\u000a\u000aWhen I got to the pump I swiped my Debit card and the machine asked me if I wanted to pay Inside or Outside. Errr, well outside of course, so I selected that option and away went my pump. As I stood there I started examining the gas station because I'd never been there before and then I looked at a digitzed money amount above the pump - IT SAID $3.34 a GALLON. W. T. effing F!!! I was pissed, but my gas tank was almost full.\u000a\u000aSo as I'm getting ready to storm in and give them a talking to, I see a tiny sign off the main road noting "$3.34 SELF SERVE"! You've got to be kidding me! So instead of being out-right charging people who use debit cards instead of cash, they sneakily place a small, small sign, not anywhere you can see it, and say it's some convenience charge for using your card at the pump.\u000a\u000aThis was just the most infuriating thing to happen to me in a long time. I've learned my lesson though. The gas industry is evil. Always has been and always will be. They will try to screw you every which way, so you better watch out.

VThis theater is enjoyable and strangely enough quite empty the majority of times I have been there. But when I think about it, that's probably an extra point - no crowds to contend with!\u000a\u000aThe theater is two stories and has decent rocky chairs. Most of the time things are cleaned, yep, that includes the bathrooms. \u000a\u000aPrices vary from day to day. However, they seem to continually do really good promotions. Right now if you save your ticket stub it's good for one free game of bowling at Sam's Town.\u000a\u000aLastly, I like that you can park on the East side of the casino and not have to walk all the way through the casino to get to the theater. The reason I can't give 5 stars is because the theater does have a vacant feeling to it. No excitement factor. BUT it's still a great place to catch a movie.

VI've stopped by this Rubio's quite a few times. Strangely enough it is probably the furthest Rubio's from where I live here in the valley. But I do have a friend who lives close by and if I'm in the area it is always nice to stop in and grab some tacos.\u000a\u000aI like Rubio's tacos. They are fresh and I have never had a bad experience with what I tend to order. I rotate between their original fish taco platter, street tacos platter, and grilled fish platter. I've never had the burritos, quesadillas, etc. On my last visit I had the street tacos platter (carne asada, chicken, and carnitas). They were all tasty and well prepared. Not fats or gristle, just good meat.\u000a\u000aThe chips are nice to dip in the beans and the numerous salsas you can get at the salsa bar. \u000a\u000aLastly, this Rubio's is clean, the employees were very nice to me and my mother (and made sure my mother did not get any guac in her meal). Overall, Rubio's is still a fave of mine, especially this location.

VWith so many sushi places in this city - are there any that truly stand out from the rest?\u000a\u000aYummy Grill & Sushi, in my opinion stands out for its supremely fresh fish and "off-menu" items. The sashimi is phenomenal (Blue Fin Tuna & Toro respectively).\u000a\u000aRolls come in a variety of styles, tastes, flavors, with sauces, without. While my friend and I dined here we ordered the following: Come To Me (spicy), Dynamite, and Tomo Devil (very nice spicy taste). The Dynamite is like your typical sushi-places except it comes out in kind of a sushi format instead of a bowl.\u000a\u000aHappy hour prices are quite nice. Ordered two rolls, one a spicy/crunchy tuna roll that I quite enjoyed.\u000a\u000aKanpachi with Serrano was somewhat disappointing. The sauce the sashimi is served in has an odd taste to it, and the Serrano pepper, while spicy, does not necessarily add to the fish in my opinion.\u000a\u000aWe ended our meal with fried green tea ice cream. Crunchy exterior, smooth finished ice cream with a strong green tea taste. \u000a\u000aThe restaurant itself is small, so if you go during high-peak times make sure to make a reservation. Also, it may be best to make sure you are "pacing" yourself here as each dish you order comes out at a much slower pace than most sushi places.\u000a\u000aThey do not do AYCE. No matter. This place is top-notch and should not be missed, based mostly on its super fresh ingredients, off-menu items, and its congenial staff.

VThis Mexican place is located on and/or near a golf course...? Possibly a retirement community? That is the clientele for sure. It is kind of like a diner in a Midwest town that attracts the olds to have coffee and eat really bland Mexican food at "that one thar Mex-ee-can" place.\u000a\u000aThe tables have no hot sauce on them. HUH?\u000a\u000aThe menu does not feature burritos. HUH?\u000a\u000aI had an a la carte chicken burrito that didn't come with ANYTHING. No salsa. No sour cream. No guac. HUH? \u000a\u000aI mean, I get that I ordered it a la carte, but not even a dollop of sour cream? Makes you go hmmm. The chicken was sub-standard and didn't have much of a sauce in it. As I sat there eating it I was envisioning a Chipotle burrito I could have gotten for a dollar less and it would have been a thousand times better.\u000a\u000aMaybe I should have ordered something different, but for a place called "El Burrito" I was shocked there was not a plethora of burritos to choose from.\u000a\u000aI say go to Chipotle over this place if you want EL BURRITO. \u000a\u000aPS - While I was there the US Foodservice truck pulled up and made a delivery. I knew this because he had an employee fill out a form and I watched him get in his truck and drive away. US FOODS you GUYZ. YIKESES.

VThis is my go-to Walgreens when I don't have time to go to Ulta/Sephora/the Base and I need makeup or perhaps a card and I don't have to time to go to Hallmkark. Maybe I need some pictures printed for some reason or another - I come here. Actually, I do the picture print order online and then just pick up the pictures, which I must admit is a really great service, except for that one time they put a sticker on one of my pictures. But they rectified the situation quickly.\u000a\u000aThe only thing I do not like about this Walgreens is the characters that stand around and ask you for money outside the store. Believe me, pretty much every time I come here I get hit up for money. Sigh. But that's the pitfalls of living where I live. \u000a\u000aFor its location the store is still decently clean and organized. I don't feel like it's not being taken care of and I've never run into a surly, unhappy employee. For the most part I've always been helped and greeted and taken care of just fine.\u000a\u000aI've also been immunized here and, of course, I've picked up prescriptions here as well. The wait times can be a bit long, but that's going to happen anywhere I'm convinced.\u000a\u000aOverall it's a Walgreens and it does its job well.

VI was hesitant to give the 5 Star rating, but I gotta do it. This Sonic hits it on the mark every time I've been here.\u000a\u000aMy boyfriend and I must be having coinciding sweet tooths lately because we have been hitting up this Sonic late at night to get some yummy ice cream concoctions. My boyfriend's go-to is always the M&M Blast and I usually switch between the Oreo Blast and the Chocolate Shake. I love their drinks. Sonic offers such a variety - shakes, slushes, sodas, and the sodas! I love that their Cherry Coke has a REAL cherry flavor and they top it off with a cherry!\u000a\u000aSonic also offers more than just your ordinary fast food fare with delicious hot dogs and the option of onions or tater tots instead of fries. The burgers are always good to me. I love their brown bag special! It's such a deal. How can you pass it up?\u000a\u000aNever met an employee who was rude, although 90% of the time I have been through the drive-thru and not the pull up windows so not a whole lot of interaction with them. \u000a\u000aSonic is a coveted institution that we in Las Vegas take for granted. People love this place and hate that they don't have their own where they live. Amazing that us Las Vegans can indulge all we want!

VWhile in the area, and after a Yelp event my friends and I were hungry. I wanted some Thai and this place popped up. It was only a hop, skip, and a jump away from where we were so we headed on out. You will miss it if you don't look for it closely in the shopping center. Just have to look for that big sign that says "THAI". \u000a\u000aThe place is small, cozy, and has a very "family" charm to it. This is mostly why I am a fan. I love places that are like this. It makes me happy to be giving my money over to people who are running a business to feed their family, and not a corporate conglomerate so they can fuel their yacht. Anyway.\u000a\u000aFood - I ordered the Chicken Curry at a spicy level of 6. I wish I had gone with an 8 because it was not very spicy at all. Although I did not mind, it was still very good. BUT, again, wish it had been spicier. I just have to test the waters of places before I can allow myself to go up into the higher numbers, so I won't ding them too much since I left without even having to wipe my nose once. I also wished for more potatoes in my curry. I really love getting those potatoes, they're such a nice surprise. \u000a\u000aService - Friendly and happy. But my table felt a little out of place when our dishes were taken away but the check was not delivered. After all, the place is small, so when we were done, it was quite obvious. We actually had to ask for the check. \u000a\u000aPrice - A good price for what I originally thought was a small portion - but no, it was just fooling me. I didn't even finish my entire bowl. But I did get rice. We got a big portion of rice for two people. We were not charged extra for the rice... which I found interesting since I saw Misti's previous review noting the extra rice charge.... \u000a\u000aUnfortunately I did not partake of the Thai Iced Tea, which I normally do when I eat Thai because I loooove it, but I really just wanted water. Maybe next time I am back at Prommares I will get the Iced Tea. \u000a\u000aOverall - I like the homey vibe and I personally like the smallness of the establishment. The food is good and so is the value. PLUS - there is hand sanitizer on every table, but I believe this is because you must walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom? Because I saw one patron go back there in search of it. Anyway, I'd go back definitely.

VI came with a Restaurant.com $25 gift certificate in my hands and I had read the not-so-stellar reviews here on Yelp, but when my husband and I entered this quaint establishment on a Saturday evening around 6:30 PM I was pleasantly surprised. It's a small dining area with bright colors and Italian-esque decorations covering the walls. There's a bunch of wine lining the back walls and only about 10 white-clothed tables. I have to admit I was comparing it to my favorite Italian place in town, which is in Downtown Las Vegas called Chicago Joe's. There's similarities and differences.\u000a\u000aTo start off with I ordered a glass of raspberry iced tea, my husband, sweet tea. The tea was deliciously sweet. Next we were served some nice, warm bread, about half a loaf with some delicious garlic butter. The butter was perfectly spreadable. The bread, although a bit tough on the outside, was still good. We were offered a second helping, but we declined. \u000a\u000aI ordered the Linquine Clams with a red sauce. When I inquired as to whether or not the red sauce had a little spice, I was told it did not have any spice, but the waitress asked me if I would like the cook to make it spicy and I said yes! So that was very nice of my waitress to cater to my desires. My husband ordered the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo and we both opted for House Salads with Ranch dressing. \u000a\u000aThe salads came out with very green leaves, shredded carrots, a few tomatoes, and a couple slices of sweet onions. In comparing this salad to the one at Chicago Joe's - this salad wins. Definitely a better variety of green lettuce leaves and a bit fresher in my opinion. \u000a\u000aNext our entrees arrived. They plate their pastas in bowl-like boat plates. They were hot and fresh, my red sauce had just the enough amount of kick to my liking. What I enjoyed a bit more about this Linquine Clam over Chicago Joe's is that there were actual clam shells with meat along with clam meat actually dispersed throughout the pasta. I think the addition of clam shells gives the dish a nice, rich oceanic flavor. It is nice to dig out the clams and get that bit of sea taste.\u000a\u000aMy husband noted that his pasta was very good, but I did not try any because I was slurping up my own. We ended up taking home leftovers and declined desert because we had a fresh pie waiting for us at home to eat.\u000a\u000aOverall the food is A+. There's no doubt about the authenticity of whoever is cooking here. The atmosphere is nice, the music was not too loud, and it is a family/casual dining experience. Service was great from our main waitress. The woman who brought us out our drinks and bread was a bit cold, but nothing so much to ruin our experience.\u000a\u000aI would certainly go back, especially if I happen to be in the Henderson area and I am craving Italian. The plus side here is that you are supporting a local mom and pop business as well. I would and will continue to gladly fork over my money to places like this over Olive Garden and Macaroni Grill.

VFiesta Henderson is actually a nice locals casino. For those living in the vicinity it provides gaming, food options (restaurants and a food court), as well as a movie theater. The great thing about the movie theater is their Tuesday special which is $7 for a movie ticket all day (even into the night). This is a great deal to take advantage of.\u000a\u000aThe casino is on the outskirts of Henderson, nestled off the 1-15 on Lake Mead Parkway. It is quite clean, does not smell like smoke very much, and although it is not big, it's a decent size. The casino is meant for locals, not for a wow factor, so you get what your come for.\u000a\u000aInside there is a center casino bar, which I partook of and was pleasantly surprised to get a Shock Top draft for $3.50. What? Let's drink here all the time!

VWhat can I say? I'm cheap!\u000a\u000aAll at the last minute I decided I wanted to do a Staycation on Memorial Day Weekend in Las Vegas. Good luck finding anything, let alone anything for a decent price the day before the weekend right? In comes... Fiesta Henderson!\u000a\u000aWith a room, and two movie tickets, and two passes to the buffet for $119.95 my husband and I were off to our cheap-o hotel fun time. \u000a\u000aSure the casino isn't great. The movie theater is, well, a movie theater, and the buffet, eh, the buffet - eh. \u000a\u000aBUT - you can't beat the price, even if the room was less than spectacular, but at least it was clean!\u000a\u000aThe pool too, was clean, and quiet, save for a few kids in the pool - and, sigh, no bar. But hey, my husband and I just brought champagne and chilled it in our ice bucket in the room, and a 6-pack of beer! We snuck our drinks into the pool hidden in normal old cups, and guess what? No one noticed. \u000a\u000aDisappointments - the lights in our room were very touchy, and randomly went on and off. And - no room service, so no breakfast in bed! *womp womp*\u000a\u000aPros - Great package deal and great discount for military. \u000a\u000aIf you want to do it on the cheap, here's the place to do it!

VSince acquiring an RV my husband and I have been to 3 Camping Worlds. The one way out South on Las Vegas Blvd is the one we actually purchased our RV at. This Camping World is WAY out on Boulder Highway. The other one we've been to was in California.\u000a\u000aAll Camping World's are about the same. I believe most of them have places where they do work on RVs and of course the retail portion. Prices are steep for certain items. You are always going to see the normal price and the "Good Sam" price. You must be a member to get that price. We are members.\u000a\u000aThis particular CW had some pretty poor customer service. My husband inquired with a young lady working the cash register how much wax/cleaning agent we would need to buy in order to wash our RV. She didn't know and asked another individual working there - who also, didn't know. In the end my husband ended up doing math in his head depending upon how big our RV is versus how many liquid ounces, etc. So, the employees were pretty much useless here.\u000a\u000aI didn't find the actual store to be bad. Everything was clean and they do have a lot of selection for different items. It's just that I would hope the staff would be a bit more educated on the products.

VQuaint diner. Small town feel outside the big city.\u000a\u000aThis place is located in "Hendertucky" on Boulder Highway. Service is quick, food comes in huge portions, menu is varied (lots of omelet selections obviously), and coffee is served up hot. All pluses for me. Another plus was their warm, soft delicious banana bread served up with nice, spreadable butter. I love a place that brings me butter with my banana bread. That's the way to eat it right!\u000a\u000aHusband and I both ordered omelets which were overflowing off our plates. We ended up taking a big portion of our meals home. I'd say the omelets had to be at least 5-eggs. They do not skimp.\u000a\u000aIf you're in the Hendertucky area and need a filling breakfast, this one is a winner!

VThis place. Oh, this place.\u000a\u000aI've been to Kavanaugh's twice and I do not understand how they are still open. It is possible their bar scene is hopping and I don't know it because I've never been in the bar part of the establishment. Although, my EX-boyfriend has since he went there the two times we ate here because he used the restroom.\u000a\u000aWhen you walk in you are greeted with two doors, one goes to the restaurant side and the other goes to the bar side. I guess it's nice that they have them separated. But like I said, I've only been on the dining side.\u000a\u000aFirst off, my EX-boyfriend and I went here on two occasions, first time was just to check the place out. It's located in waaaaay North Las Vegas in a rather desolate part of town. When we walked in the dining room had about three other groups eating. We were both sorely disappointed with the menu as it did not offer too many actual Irish dishes. It was mostly just bar food and they even had pasta. I don't get it - why do these places boast themselves as being Irish and then serve Italian dishes? Ugh. Pet peeve of mine I guess.\u000a\u000aAnywho, I ordered the chicken avocado sandwich and honestly it was pretty good. I forgot what my EX-boyfriend had but I remember him liking it. They do have some Irish beers, which is nice. Pretty sure the EX-boyfriend ordered a dark Irish beer and I went for wine. Overall it was an okay first experience, but I wasn't terribly impressed.\u000a\u000aThe second time we went was for Valentine's Day. Originally we were going to go to a steak house, but my EX-boyfriend failed to make a reservation (argargargar.....). So, we decided to go here. Bad idea! The service was just God-awful. Awful. Awful. We waited FOREVER just to get our drink order. I mean about 20 minutes. TWENTY MINUTES. And the place was not packed. But there was only one waiter. But STILL. My EX-boyfriend decided we better get an appetizer since we were both starving and knew it would probably take forever for our meals to come out. Well we were right, we got our small appetizers and sure enough, we waited about 30 minutes for our meals. It was insane how poor the place was being run. \u000a\u000aI was not happy by the end of the meal and I told my EX-boyfriend not to leave a good tip because the service was so bad. I mean I used to serve tables. I served for 2 years and sometimes I would be put in the position of having a busy place and being the only server there, but I always busted my butt to make sure people were taken care of. It just irritates me when servers don't do their job. Ya, I get it - you're not in the most glamorous position, maybe you're having a bad night, but come on. \u000a\u000aJust not worth it to eat here. Not so good food, bad service, not really a lot of "Irish" about the place at all, and well it's a sad little place in a desolate area of town.

VMcCarran International. The airport you can leisurely gamble at and then grab a flight. McCarran has evolved quite a bit in the many years it has been here in Vegas providing tourists and locals flights to and fro.\u000a\u000aCurrently I work at McCarran. My job to be undisclosed. I work at the new terminal "T3". The new terminal is completely different from the old. It is marble, expansive, long, sterile. It's what a lot of airports look like. But once you understand the layout it makes sense. T3 also offers gambling (although in smaller capacity than T1) and it has numerous restaurants - a chop house, quite a few fast food options, a Starbucks and a Coffee Bean. It is also just a tram ride to D gates which houses many more options for dining and shopping.\u000a\u000aSince T3 replaced T2 there is no T2, so there is just T1 and T3. One day, I suppose, T2 will be referred to as some strange place that really never existed *waves hands in an eerie way*. Who knows why they didn't just make T3 the new T2? We'll never know...\u000a\u000aAs for T1 - it is in dire need of renovation, except for C-Annex and C-Gates, which houses the entire Southwest flights for the airport. A/B gates are exceptionally old, as is the security checkpoint. The whole thing should be busted up and re-created to look newer and nicer. D-Gates checkpoint is also poorly lit and stinky. The place needs a serious renovation. The actual D-Gates (which is separate from the checkpoint) is a very nice, new cosmopolitan looking establishment.\u000a\u000aParking isn't terrible, but you do have to pay the meters. It's easiest just to time it right so when you pick people up you only have to pay a few bucks. Sometimes passenger pick-up can be a hassle because those cops out there really don't like you to sit around and make you drive around and around if the people you are picking up aren't there yet.\u000a\u000aSo there you have it - the run down of McCarran.

VCharming. Quaint. Fun. Delicious.\u000a\u000aAll of these words can be used to describe Chicago Joe's. Well it's a homey, no-frills, Italian restaurant located in what used to be a small house in downtown Las Vegas - so what is there not to like?\u000a\u000aI had the lovely experience of joining a large group for a pre-set meal at Chicago Joes. Although we did get some choices of what we would like. From the wine to the home made cannoli, I must say Chicago Joes, you've impressed me.\u000a\u000aThey did start us out with their bread sticks, however they weren't really the consistency I tend to enjoy. None the less, with balsamic and oil to dip them in they were a lovely treat! Next came the salad, a bit small and only iceberg lettuce. However, the house dressing made up for the lack of more leafy greens. \u000a\u000aI opted for the RED marinara, clam sauce spaghetti. I am so glad I went with this choice because it was absolutely delicious. Out of everything I ate here, it was the star. I couldn't believe clams could be do delicious!\u000a\u000aIf you want some very down-to-earth, no-frills, straight-up like an old Italian Grandma would make it food, then you better get to Joe's!

VI am very impressed with this facility.\u000a\u000aA couple weeks ago my boyfriend decided we should get a new dog. Although he decided we should go look very late in the day - we got there really late, about 45 minutes before they were closing. We did get to look through the kennels, but the staff had everyone leave at the closing time. We returned the next morning to continue our search.\u000a\u000aI have lived in Vegas for a long, long time and I have been to Lied awhile ago. Believe me, this place has had a serious face-lift and the volunteers and employees who work here have seriously been upgraded as well. When I remember being here as a child, it was a very sad experience. Yes, going to the pound is typically a sad experience in a way, but now it is not so bad.\u000a\u000aThe dogs are all kept in very clean kennels, they have doggy doors that exit the back of their kennels as well. The buildings the kennels are housed in appear to have AC as well. \u000a\u000aAll of the dogs looked very well taken care of and they have a system that indicates whether or not the dog has had a walk that day or not. If you find a dog you like you can very quickly find one of the employees or one of the volunteers who will get you a leash and open the kennel for you.\u000a\u000aOnce you get out the dog you can walk him/her around, there are even enclosed yard-like areas that you can take the dog in to and allow them to run around and play. It is a fantastic way to find out if you click with a dog and if they like you/you like them, etc. \u000a\u000aThe check-out process is easy-peasy! Once you've decided you like a doggy and want to take him/her home you simply let someone know, they have people with laptops right there who will take your information, ask you questions, and let you know about the history of the animal. Then that person will direct you to the other part of the facility where you will finish up your process.\u000a\u000aBonus - they also give you a small bag of the food that the animal has been eating there at the facility. They suggest you mix that food with whatever food you plan on feeding the dog so they can be weaned into it without getting an upset stomach from a quick food switch.\u000a\u000aOur little pup is a little over a year old and he's happily adjusting to his new life. We've had him for a couple weeks now and he's very happy! So glad we had such a good experience here. :)

VGlad I didn't pay for my meal here.\u000a\u000aEnded up going to this Tony Roma's which is inside the Fremont Casino with a large group (my family primarily). As stated at the beginning of the review, glad I wasn't paying for my meal because it was not good.\u000a\u000aI ordered the "recommended" Tony Roma's Steakhouse Burger and asked for it medium well. It came out medium for sure. Very pink in the middle, definitely not cooked enough to my liking. However, I was so hungry I did not bother to return it to the waitress. I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack. She seriously was running around like a chicken with her head cut off. I think she had too many tables.\u000a\u000aMy brother also had the Steakhouse burger. We both agreed it wasn't anything spectacular. It came with two big slices of bacon on it and it was a pretty good size. The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger. It seemed like they'd been sitting around before being brought out. My aunt got the spinach dip appetizer. I had a taste, it tasted like spinach dip... and it too was lukewarm. My uncle got the shrimp cocktail. The shrimps looked decent sized, but the presentation was a little weird in my opinion. \u000a\u000aThis place is seriously a tourist trap for sure. The dining room is also dark and off-putting. They have really, really cheap specials which i did not partake of, but I don't know, maybe they're worth it? \u000a\u000aFinal decision: Tony Roma's will not be on my list of places I want to go eat.

VNiiiiiiice! \u000a\u000aDid not know the Golden Nugget had been renovated! I heard they had a new pool, but did not know the whole place had had a face lift. It certainly has and man, it is looking nice. It is definitely a welcome change from the other casinos on Fremont Street.\u000a\u000aInside there are nice colors, new carpets. There is a mellow orange/yellow/bronze theme going on. Nice chandeliers hanging from the ceilings, looking kind of art-deco-ish. Smokey smell is kept to a minimum as well! They probably put in a new air system.\u000a\u000aMy relatives had three rooms here. One in the Carson Tower and two in the Gold Tower. Oh dayum, their rooms in the Gold Towers were great! All new furniture, flat screen TVs, nice beds. I can't comment on their room service or anything, but the rooms - definitely looking good! The room in the Carson Tower was much smaller, but still nice.\u000a\u000aI did not get to enjoy the pool, but from looking at it, it seemed a bit small to me. However, the water slide looks fun! And of course they have the aquarium with the sharks in it right next to the pool. Oh and word to the wise my relatives said there is a pool called the "Hideaway" which has less children and is 16+. \u000a\u000aI just really enjoyed my time in here over the weekend meeting my relatives.

VLet's do an update.\u000a\u000aMy last review of Golden Nugget did not include the hotel rooms, but since I stayed at Golden Nugget a few weekends ago for my bachelorette party downtown I can now do an update involving the rooms, the casino, and room service.\u000a\u000aIf I were reviewing solely on the room this review would be a 2.5-star, which I know is impossible, so I have to bump it up to a 3. The room we stayed in looked as though it had undergone a serious revamp, but it was very eclectic and not in a good eclectic way. There were random half-curtains everywhere. The one on the bathtub was especially odd. Why only part of the curtain? The fabrics chosen clashed throughout the hotel room. I wish they'd gone with more of a neutral palette rather than many patterns. \u000a\u000aThe room was clean though and they do supply plenty of towels and toiletries. Room service was ordered for myself because I was super late in getting to my own bachelorette party because of work. They have pretty standard fare and I ordered the chicken strips. They did come with a BBQ dipping sauce, but no ranch and came with some decent french fries. \u000a\u000aEven though we we stayed a GN we didn't get a chance to utilize their awesome pool. Around 10 AM is was already packed and I actually saw people setting up their towels on the hard concrete because there were no chairs left. Icky. No thanks. \u000a\u000aThe casino review stands. It's still nice inside and everything has been redone. Therefore 2.5 room, but considering it's Downtown and the casino is nice must go up to 4 stars.

VThis review is based on a few things: the casino itself, the movie theaters, a few stores, and it is based off me having been a regular of this casino since I was a small child.\u000a\u000aSam's Town has been around for a LONG time and even has an album named after it. If you don't know the artist, just look it up. It's a "good ol" western themed place. Plus it is for locals and cowboys who come in for the rodeo. On that level, the casino is probably deserving of 3 stars, but I think it's gone down hill in the past couple years.\u000a\u000aHere are some good things: the movie theaters are actually quite nice and well kept. They're hardly ever really busy, which make them a good place to go if you want to see a movie by yourself.\u000a\u000aSam's Town also has Shepler's which is a great place to find western wear in Las Vegas.\u000a\u000aI am weary of the restaurants here as I experienced an upset tummy after eating at the TGI Fridays. The Mexican place here is called Willy & Jose's and has a bottomless margaritas deal going on right now - but I have yet to indulge.\u000a\u000aIt's not the best place, nor is it the worst. It is a locals hotel and out of all the places on Boulder Highway I like this casino the best.

VOrleans hosts a bevvy of "other" options for patrons of a casino. Including a movie theater, bowling center, movie theater, and arcade. Since I dislike casinos that smell of ratted smokey clothing (which the Orleans does) I am happy to note the movie theater is removed from the rest of the casino one floor up. This floor hosts the theater, an arcade, and place for parents to drop their children off so they can gamble or see a movie in peace.\u000a\u000aThe theater itself isn't bad. It's actually quite large. It has two snack stands, the one further in even offers seating with tables and chairs. The theaters are clean. They offer 3D movies here as well. \u000a\u000aOn my recent visit with my father and my brother we watched The Hobbit at my father's urging. We did not get to experience the 3D version so I can only comment on the normal version. There were no problems with the movie playing and the sound was good. We did order popcorn and service was a bit hectic because we were there when they just opened their doors.\u000a\u000aOverall it's an okay theater. I would not go out of my way to come here unless the movie time coincided with the conditions to see the movie, which it did this time.

VGood alterations place. It is small and run by Ana... I guess? She took a few inches off of a gown I purchased at Nordstrom and only charged me $20. I was suspecting it would cost me more, but nope!\u000a\u000aThis is a no-frills establishment, but if you need something hemmed I would recommend this place. If I ever buy any new slacks for work or purchase another gown (haha, ya right) in the near future I will come here. \u000a\u000aFor the record she had my gown ready the morning of the event and I was super nervous about picking it up so close to the time for me to be in it and looking presentable in front of hundreds of people, BUT thank goodness - it came out perfect!

VI love, love, love, love Irish Pubs. I'm a sucker for them. What can I say? I'd rather go out and have a dark beer and a shot of Jameson than do just about anything else on a weekend. McMullans is a place I love. \u000a\u000aI've been here on a few occasions, a couple dates with the boyfriend, and also meeting up with friends. The service is typically a toss of a coin. Either you get really stellar service or kind of "eh" service. I typically only see women working here, from the hostess to the waitresses to the bartenders. Service at the bar the last time I was here was so-so. \u000a\u000aI had their Irish Breakfast, which is in Irish breakfast fashion - huge and way too much for me to eat. Plus they add on top of it a cup of beans, delicious heavy-as-heck bread, and a grilled tomato. Add to that Irish bacon, black and white pudding (blood sausage/sausage), a sausage link, and three eggs (however you want 'em). Oh it's just too much for me to eat, but I put a pretty good dent in it. The Irish Nachos are also freaking Awwwwe-some! Order these for sure if you want an appetizer to go along with your alcohol!\u000a\u000aThey're serving my favorite Irish staples - Guinness, Smithwicks, and Jameson. They also have a few other beers on tap for those that do not like the dark beers.\u000a\u000aALSO - live music the last time I was there! Very fun and entertaining. Lots of audience participation - this is not for the shy of heart! I was actually called out for clapping out of place during a song (although I SWEAR I didn't and so does my friend), but I was pointed at by the entire bar area and forced to have a drink for punishment!\u000a\u000aOnly reason I'm not giving 5 Stars is because the service can be so random. Doesn't matter - still one of my favorite places in Vegas!

VI have eaten at a Black Bear Diner before in Reno, NV. That Black Bear's interior is a lot more fun and "wood cabin" like than this Black Bear. My fiance and I ate here this morning (Thursday) at about 9:30 AM. We were seated quickly and greeted by a very jubilant waitress who brought out our drinks as we looked over the menu.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Hobo Omelet with hashbrowns. My fiance got the "volcano" (3 pancakes, 2 bacon, 2 eggs, and 2 sausage). Our food came out relatively fast and my coffee cup was kept filled (yes! I love it when my coffee cup is filled!). \u000a\u000aSo the tastes... I felt as though my omelet was all right. When I read that there would be spinach in it I was excited, but it was lacking in the spinach area. Kind of a disappointment. However, it was big and meaty - no skimping there. I kind of yearned for a bit more cheese as well, but oh well. Once I put their pepper sauce on it that made it very delectable to me, because I love spicy. \u000a\u000aThe omelet came with an english muffin as well (nothing fancy), and the hasborwns were kind of mooshy inside. They could have been cooked a bit longer in my opinion.\u000a\u000aMy fiance's food was pleasing to him. He didn't finish his pancakes but the rest of his meal quickly disappeared.\u000a\u000aI have to raise a red flag though - beware the price of orange juice! What is with restaurants charging so much for OJ?! Seriously, my fiance's OJ cost $4.99. WHAT?! Yah, you read that right. Cup of OJ = $4.99. That is insane my friends. Just insane.\u000a\u000aEdit - The OJ is fresh squeezed. Although I still feel that is quite pricey for OJ.

VSecond go-round at Black Bear Diner involved my husband and his cousin along with her boyfriend. The couple beckoned upon us to dine with them since they were in town for a friend's 40th birthday. My husband's desire to eat off the Strip made our decision become Black Bear Diner this morning for a late breakfast around 11 AM.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant still retains its homey vibe with all the bears looking down upon your from the rafters. The newspaper menus are a nice touch, especially with their extensive menu items.\u000a\u000aI was tempted to order a more lunch-like item, but everyone else seemed to be going for breakfast. I didn't feel like too many eggs or pancakes so I decided upon their combo-type plate which allow you to choose from a few different options to make a specific breakfast meal for yourself for $8.99\u000a\u000aMy order included biscuits and gravy, link sausages, and eggs over easy. Black Bear provides a heaping mound of food - don't worry, you will not leave this place hungry. My biscuits and gravy were all right. The biscuits were delicious and flaky, not too dense, but not too airy either. However, the gravy was lacking. It certainly was lacking bits of sausage, which I would expect more of and it was lacking a salty-taste. Unfortunately they were a miss for me. My eggs were extremely runny. I realize I ordered them over easy, but even the white were a bit under cooked for my preference. The sausage links were tasty. \u000a\u000aThe only other thing I can comment on is apparently their homemade sausage patties contain fennel seeds, which understandably, some people do not enjoy, myself included. My husband's cousin ended up picking out quite of few of them from her patties so she could enjoy the meat without so many seeds. So - if you don't like fennel - beware!\u000a\u000aI'm going to stick with my 4-star rating, especially since service was good, the coffee was good, and because the bit of pancakes I ate off my husband's plate were very good as well.

VI always feel kind of bad giving a one or two star review. I did like Sushi Factory's sushi, but there was something about the place that I can't exactly put my finger on that just will not let me give it over a two star rating. Okay, let's go with 2.5. \u000a\u000aWhen I arrived I was greeted by a very friendly hostess and seated quickly. Can I comment on the decor? I don't know, just looked a little ram-shackle to me. Ok ok... I'm not trying to be nit-picky, after all I do eat at plenty "dumpy" kind of joints because their food is AWESOME. But somehow dumpy + place that is serving me raw fish = me weirded out a bit.\u000a\u000aI did the AYCE with my date. He was all hype about liking sushi though, he wouldn't even touch the sashimi I ordered, but instead insisted on all the fried little concoctions. One of our rolls completely fell apart when we tried eating it. Date didn't seem to care, but I was a little peeved.\u000a\u000aThank goodness they brought me out sake to begin with. I think this soothed the bad experience. \u000a\u000aDon't get me wrong, it's a decent little place, I just don't think I'll be going back considering there are much better places in the valley to get AYCE sushi.

VThis Port of Subs is located in a desolate shopping center. The only thing in this place attracting any attention is the pitiful Target that happens to be the only "big-box" store left in the area.\u000a\u000aEstablishment was clean, sandwich-makers were there, and came out to make my sandwich when I entered. All pluses. \u000a\u000aI ordered my usual - cheddar, ham, turkey on wheat. Made it a combo. It was a good POS sandwich.\u000a\u000aWill probably become a go-to for my lunch breaks.

VI wish I could give Excalibur no stars. I think this place is in need of a makeover. That makeover being imploding the damn thing and getting it off the Strip because it's an eyesore inside and out. \u000a\u000aI get it, it's probably the one place in Las Vegas parents can really take their kids to. The theme is kiddy, they have a "Dungeon" full of games and carnival-type experiences. The shows here are comical/fun. It's all about fun, fun, fun here!\u000a\u000aUnfortunately the place is a dump. It stinks. The casino floor has that early 90s vibe to it. The food court is odd and out of place. The buffet is horrible. Other dining options are ridiculous too: Bucca di Bepo (poor excuse for Italian) and Dick's Last Resort. Okay, I've never been to Dick's, but who really wants to be insulted by their waiter? And of course the new BBQ joint, which I've heard good things about, and would be more apt to try... if it wasn't in Excalibur.\u000a\u000aI cannot comment on their rooms since I've never stayed here, but I can only imagine what they must be like, unless of course, they've been renovated.\u000a\u000aOverall this place just needs to go away. It's from a different era, one of which we moved on from a long time ago.

VI spend a lot of time at the Convention Center because I work as a temp through a couple different agencies and often end up here to do registration, etc. \u000a\u000aI think this place is in dire need of a makeover. The carpets are whacked out with ugly designs and the place is just boring and bland. There's just nothing here that makes you say, "Wow" besides the fact that it is huge. \u000a\u000aHere are some tips about the convention center though, whether you're attending a conference or working there:\u000a\u000aCabs will always take longer than you suspect, so always leave a little early. This goes the same for the monorail.\u000a\u000aThe layout of the convention center makes for long hikes to and fro. Expect to be walking - a lot. So ladies, just leave the heels at home.\u000a\u000aThe food choices are blah - Nathan's Hot Dogs and the over-priced Banners place will have you spending about $10+ for a meal with a drink included. Oh, there's also a bunch of Starbucks set up offering half of what a typical Starbucks offers with a pricier price tag - of course!\u000a\u000aIt can go from freezing to stifling hot, so bring differing types of clothing.\u000a\u000aParking is ridiculous. Especially if you're working here, you don't want to spend $10 to park! No siree! On smaller conventions try the Hilton Sports Book off of Joe W. Brown (runs behind the convention center), but not for bigger conventions - they will be charging for parking. Also try parking lots by the Riviera - sometimes you'll be able to get free parking. OR for big conventions try the street parking to the West of the Convention Center up Paradise Road. There are a few streets where on-street parking is available. Believe me, walking a little bit is worth not getting hit with a parking ticket!\u000a\u000aLastly, I always say be safe when leaving the Convention Center. I don't think it is in the best part of town. Do pairs, go in groups, just don't walk by yourself. \u000a\u000aThat's it, I can't think of anything else to say. :)

VI just got back from an experience at Firefly meeting with a friend to have dinner. I wanted to get this review in quick before I forgot about all the little nuances and why it is getting a 3-star rating , instead of the 4 or 5 it should have gotten.\u000a\u000aFirst, I want to point out that I am a huge fan of Firefly. It is one of my favorite spots in Las Vegas and honestly if I'm going to have tapas I am going to go to Firefly. Personally my favorite Firefly was the one in The Plaza downtown, but since I cannot review that one since it is now closed *sad face*, I will be satisfied with the location on Paradise.\u000a\u000aFirst off, this location's parking situation has always irritated me. And  often when they do valet I just can't believe it. It's a ridiculous situation. But that is the least of my complaints for tonight. First let me begin with the service - it was "okay". The food came out quickly, none of our meals were forgotten, but when it came to delivering our check, the waiter dropped the ball - BIG TIME. He came and asked us if we wanted dessert and we said no, he asked if we wanted more drinks, we said no. This is a clear indication that we wanted OUR CHECK. Our check never came. We sat for a little over 30 minutes and we were forced to wave down a girl, who was not even our server so we could get our check. *sigh*\u000a\u000aThis was a bad experience, I must admit, because all of my other experiences at Firefly have been superb! Both at the Paradise AND Downtown location.\u000a\u000aWhat about the food? Well, I strayed from my favorites this time ( I LOVE the shrimp ceviche, it is SO delicious). This time I had the artichoke toasts. These were good and the aioli on them made them delectable! However, I also had the empanada (probably the worst empanada I've ever had in my entire life). And the mushroom tart. Here's what I have to say about the mushroom tart: it's too big for a tapa, unless you're sharing, it's too rich for a tapa, and I really wish I had known that.\u000a\u000aOn this occasion I did not have sangria, but I do highly recommend it based on my previous experiences, especially if you are in a large group - spring for the pitchers! \u000a\u000aLastly - the banana Nutella dessert IS absolutely delicious and although I did not have it on this visit I highly recommend it. \u000a\u000aI will absolutely go back to Firefly, but I think I'm going to stick to my favorites from now on: ceviche, the fries, and the artichoke toasts. I really wish I could have given a better review, but just based off the tapas I ordered and the poor service, only a 3-star rating it shall be until I make a return trip.

VI'm still a fan of Firefly, but for some reason I think this place is beginning to rub me the wrong way. Maybe it's because when they had their place downtown I really enjoyed going there over going to the Paradise location and now I'm forced to go to the Paradise location because the downtown location closed.\u000a\u000aI went here last night and shared Sangrias with a group of friends and also ordered some ceviche. My boyfriend had never been here before and he didn't seem too impressed. He (and I) were incredibly annoyed by the very, very loud group of girls to the right of us. We were seated in the front part of the restaurant in the couch area and they were directly to the right of us. At times I couldn't even hear my boyfriend and he was sitting right next to me. Good luck trying to hear the other people in my party.\u000a\u000aThe sangria was good, our waiter was attentive and nice. The atmosphere is the same 'ol. Maybe I'm just ready to move on to a new place...

VSpago has been around for awhile. It is certainly a staple of the Forum Shops. And, it has to be a Vegas must-try, especially if you're a local. You can't live here and not eat here at least once. I support this mostly because it has been around for so long and has not been transformed into another eatery.\u000a\u000aWolfgang Puck is doing a good job here. It isn't a home-run, but it is damn close. \u000a\u000aMy friend and I dined on a Wednesday night at about 6 PM. We chose to sit "outside" versus inside of the restaurant. Each place has its own menu. Dining inside means paying more money, basically.\u000a\u000aBeing outside is fine though, and boasts a menu with many great options. \u000a\u000aThe beginning of the meal is what draws the most ire for me. They presented some bread, which is fine, but the bread was boring and the butter was hard as a rock. If the bread had been warm, the butter being cold wouldn't have been such an issue, but with both the bread and butter being cold, it was hard to spread. I know, am I a whiny brat, or what? *cringes at my own hoity-toity-ness*\u000a\u000aWe started with the Maryland crab cakes, topped with heirloom tomatoes, aioli, and herbs. The cakes were small, but fresh. Fresh taste = good for me. Tomatoes were a nice acidic addition.\u000a\u000aMy main course was the braised beef short ribs. Spectacular. Moist and mouth-watering. Falls apart under your fork. A bit of fattiness (to be expected). But this dish starts cooking in the early morning and by the time you are having it at 6:30 PM at night - perfection! Came with asparagus and gnochi. Gnochi was only okay. It was a bit over-cooked. Minor detail.\u000a\u000aLastly, we had the Valrhona Chocolate Cremeux. A lovely little dessert, incredibly rich, with fresh raspberries and an almond-crunch center. My friend also partook of some tea, which they boast quite a menu full of numerous varieties with interesting descriptions. For instance, my friend's tea was described as "Fresh Cut Grass/Ocean Mist". I thought it tasted like green tea, but smelt a bit like my front yard in the Summer.\u000a\u000aI'm glad I tried Spago. I think it is doing well and holding its own. There's no reason I would not go back.

VOh The Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes. I have brought many a family member and friend here just to walk around and gawk at things. I have never, not once, bought something here. I am sure other locals will not be surprised by this omission, as I am sure other locals would say the same thing.\u000a\u000aThe gondola rides have been around forever it seems and I have yet to step foot on one. However, it is fun to giggle at the tourists floating around in a fake Venice. I suppose if I had the expendable cash it would be a cute thing to do, but considering how long I've gone without doing the gondola ride, my expectations of really doing it are very low.\u000a\u000aI feel as though the Canal Shoppes are set up strangely and I always get lost. I've been in this place probably 20+ times and I still get lost. Especially now that they have been linked to the Palazzo Shoppes. \u000a\u000aPlus, I am sorry, but I just cannot get over the baby-hooker smell of The Venetian/Grand Canal Shoppes. Yes, I have dubbed it baby-hooker smell. I don't care what The Venetian thinks it smells like, it smells like baby-hooker.

VCanaletto is located half "outside" in the square of the Venetian's Canal Shoppes and half "inside" the actual restaurant. We arrived as a 5-some with no reservation on a Saturday night at about 7:30 PM. This had been a slapped together plan after another dining option fell through with a newly-married couple, myself, my husband, and mother of the groom.\u000a\u000aLuckily, they were able to seat us inside and we waited no less than 5 minutes. Ambiance of the restaurant is Italian, with masks on the walls and dim lighting. Our server was exceptionally nice, especially since many in our party had picky pallets. \u000a\u000aStarted with complimentary bread, olive oil and balsamic. Bread had a crusty exterior and soft interior. My husband also managed to grab the only roll served that had raisins in it. Next drinks; I ordered a Willamette Valley Riesling because I'm fairly certain I've had that varietal before and I enjoyed it, especially since it was the cheapest wine on the menu - still very good. Also, the have some decent beer options, as both the males at the table ordered and drank a few Blue Moons.\u000a\u000aI was torn between the Bolognese Gnocchi and the Canelloni Chicken. I do love ordering gnocchi at nice Italian restaurants, but I asked the server which I should have and she said the Canelloni. Although the Canelloni was good, came with two sauces (cheese-based white and tomato-based red), I felt as though my meal was a bit disappointing compared to everyone's elses's at the table. Also, I thought the cheese sauce to be a bit bland, like it needed something, but the mushrooms on the dish helped, and the chicken was tender - a rotisserie-style, tender, and flavorful.\u000a\u000aMy husband ordered their special that night - a pasta with a lobster-bisque sauce, sea bass, salmon, shrimp, and clams, and mushrooms. I tried it, it was divine.\u000a\u000aThe server was also able to get a chicken alfredo dish made for someone at our table who was quite picky. Obviously an "off menu" item they basically just whipped together for our table. And lastly, our bride was suffering from an inability to select something off the menu as well. Instead our server asked us what type of meat she would like, she said lobster. So, they also, basically just made a pasta dish, plopped it into a fabulously cooked lobster and delivered it to the table. Honestly, it was a lovely sight to see and she said it tasted amazing.\u000a\u000aLastly we ordered some gelato all around. I got the strawberry with dark chocolate, which came with a nice, crunchy-sugary biscotti and had a tasty, but not over-powering strawberry taste. A light dessert, so a nice end to a heavy pasta meal.\u000a\u000aOur server was a very nice woman, catering to our whimsical table and happy to take pictures of the bride and room and the party.\u000a\u000aOnly thing I could say is, they were definitely aware we were a wedding party, but really nothing special was done for the bride and groom. I thought perhaps a free dessert may have been in order, with a "Congratulations" written on the plate? I've seen that a lot in other restaurants, so I was surprised when nothing of the sort emerged in surprise-form for us.\u000a\u000aNone the less, it was a nice meal for us all, especially since the original plans fell through. Also, many props to the waitress for crafting some off-menu choices. Out of a lot of "Italian" places this one was certainly better than some I have been to in Vegas.

VUgh. The Sands as a convention center is just wrong.\u000a\u000aThe main reason for the ugh is the parking situation here. Where is it? I've lived in Las Vegas forever and I've been doing conventions for two and a half years. I've worked here a few times, but I always park at The Palazzo and walk through to the convention center. \u000a\u000aNext reason for "ugh". The place has long, dim, dark hallways leading to meeting rooms. Often convention-goers and workers are bustling around in places that seem inappropriate for them to be doing so.\u000a\u000aIt does have a lot of space and it is connected to The Venetian/Palazzo, which I believe is its one true saving grace.\u000a\u000aAlso they have renovated the carpet recently which in turn has made the place have a fresher scent. Still, I feel as though this place could be improved by being completely torn down and made new again.

VOriginally I was going to give this place two stars, so consider this a 2.5 I guess. I was out showing some new friends around Las Vegas and taking them to the more out of the way places tourist typically do not see. I thought Ellis Island would be the kicker for the night, because all four of the boys (Marines, btw) really wanted to do karaoke.\u000a\u000aWe arrived there a little after 11 PM and went to the karaoke bar and the place was pretty crowded. It looked like your Ellis Island crowd. I have been to Ellis Island before, just not to the karaoke part. Well we all got in no problem and grabbed some beers at the bar. Okay, they have incredibly cheap drinks. $1.75 for a beer. Crazy cheap. We all ordered a round of their in house light beer. Yes, they do brew their own beer, pretty cool. The boys went and selected their songs and my friend (who is a local) and I hung out to stalk a table.\u000a\u000aEventually a group left and we got a pretty sweet table in the back with a good view of the stage. Everything was going pretty cool - except for the fact the place was stifling hot! I don't know if they're trying to save money by not cranking up the AC, but when there are that many people in an old bar, you better get some AC running!! It did cool down, but being in a hot bar is just gross.\u000a\u000aAs we waited for the boys' names to be called we had another round and this time tried the Hefeweizen beer. Whoa. It tasted like orange juice, just straight up OJ with a splash of beer. I didn't really like it, neither did anyone else.\u000a\u000aFinally the boys names came up and they went to sing. The first one went and then we waited. And then the next boy got called. Well, they were planning on singing a duet song (Brooks & Dunn I think) and the lady running the karaoke wouldn't let them! She said they couldn't because the first guy had just gone up to sing. It was a shame. Plus right after that they let another girl go up who had just been up on the stage about 20 minutes earlier. Just seemed eff'd up to me and we were all kind of pissed about it.\u000a\u000aSo, we left on a sour note. We didn't feel like waiting around through another 10 singers just for the boys to get another chance to sing.\u000a\u000aIt was pretty obvious they were letting people who are regulars there go up on the stage multiple times, but first timers not so much. I get it, it's a local place and a local event and that's who they're catering to - but they made ME feel bad because my friends got skunked out of doing karaoke! \u000a\u000aThis night just left a bad taste in my mouth (with the bad Hefenweizen and the situation).

VSurprising as it may be, you can find nice, clean, up-beat places on the East side. This DQ happens to be one of those places. Although it is small, it makes up for that in good customer service and a very clean, tidy store.\u000a\u000aMy husband and I stopped here after lunch one afternoon to share a blizzard. DQ is DQ pretty much and blizzards never really change. As long as you can turn your cup upside down and it doesn't fall out, you're pretty much guaranteed a good ice cream treat.\u000a\u000aOverall I'd return here when a craving for a blizzard or a dilly bar hit me.

VA combination of, "this is pretty good" and "this is not so great" paired with slow service and a confusion on where to park leads to this 3-star rating based on happy hour.\u000a\u000aMcCormick & Schmick's really pushes its happy hour. It is even plastered on its large sign attracting people off of Flamingo, the busiest street next to the restaurant. Also, M&S is situated in the Howard Hughes business park, so, a good idea to attract all those suits and ties would certainly be a slammin' happy hour.\u000a\u000aWas it slammin'? Not really. Was it good? Sure. Spectacular? Nah.\u000a\u000aHappy Hour is in the bar area only. My friend and I arrived on a Tuesday night, about 5:30 PM.\u000a\u000aOrdered:\u000a\u000aSpinach dip - came out piping hot, but the pita chips were so, so very sad. I felt so bad for these pita chips. They were so small, they were so dry, they were so boring. I am fairly certain they came out of a bag. The spinach dip was good, but the pita chips were so small, my friend and I had eaten them all and still had spinach dip leftover. I used the spinach dip leftovers to slather my Baja Fish Tacos.\u000a\u000aBaja Fish Tacos - My friend and both got these. Plus - nice, big servings! The fish was decent and crunchy, not mushy, but I got the feeling these too may have come out of a pre-packaged bag. Hrmmm. Just not good considering this place should be an upscale steakhouse/seafood place. Slaw inside was tasty and it was served with a green, spicy, creamy sauce. Adding my leftover spinach dip made it a very filling happy hour plate.\u000a\u000aFries - Meh. Came out kind of mooshy, definitely not a good option. Obviously these too came out of bag. No way these were fresh cut fries *thumbs down*\u000a\u000aWine - $6 a glass. Ya, okay. Not much to say.\u000a\u000aOverall - Only OKAY. I had higher expectations. I doubt I will come here to spend big bucks on a dinner. I'll go somewhere else that is not owned by the chain Landry's.

VAs you might suspect The Hush Puppy on Nellis Blvd has been around for a LONG time. How can I attest to that fact? I vividly remember having a temper tantrum as a child (probably 5 years old) near the salad bar. Rolling around on the floor tantrum, as in my mother spanked me in public tantrum (hello 80s!). Anyway, I am now 27 years old and have been to The Hush Puppy on numerous occasions. \u000a\u000aBasically this is a southern-style fish restaurant. A majority of the seafood (and alligator) are fried. Fried clam strips, fried shrimp, fried catfish, etc. If you're looking for more of the "grilled" fresh from the sea type stuff you are going to the wrong place. I've tried just about everything here, but my faves are definitely the all you can eat crab legs, the catfish, and the clam strips. I friggin love clam strips, I don't know why, but I do. ALSO - don't forget the hush puppies here. I personally think they could use a bit more flavor, but when you put their sweet butter on them they turn into delectable little treats. The salad bar is meager at best, but I doubt you're really coming here to fill up on salad.\u000a\u000aAs for the ambiance - service can be hit or miss. I know I've come here with my family before and been just irritated with the lackluster service, but then other times when the service was great. Unfortunately I think that just comes with the territory of the place. It is not fine dining, so the servers are just going to be a draw for ya.\u000a\u000aI assume some people would be turned off by the location, it is a bit desolate, but most of the time when the place is hopping the parking lot is full. It's old, yes. But it's a great place to get your fishy/southern munch on.

VA delicious ALOHA hour experience. Review is of bar-seating and happy hour only.\u000a\u000aRoy's is a chain, but this a chain I can get behind. Food is creative, yet sensible. Selections on the HH menu seem to be well thought-out and executed. I would not mind one bit returning to Roy's for another HH session, nor would I mind returning for a full out meal.\u000a\u000aMy friend and I dined on a Tuesday afternoon around 5 PM. We sat ourselves at the bar, which was empty, but became full as we passed out time there. Our bartender was congenial and happy with us, except toward the end when he realized I would only be having one cocktail during my time there.\u000a\u000aOrdered:\u000a\u000aMahi Mahi Fish Tacos ($6) - A decent little presentation of hard-shelled tacos filled to the brim with Mahi Mahi. I did like the tacos, but wish the fish had been more prevalent. There was quite a bit of some kind of sauce in there that I could have done without and just had the fish. It was still good.\u000a\u000aAhi Roll ($6) - A very nice roll presented on a plate of sauce with wasabi and ginger. Soy sauce and chopsticks were provided. The roll was good enough for me, but I have had better at restaurants that specialize in sushi alone. But do not take that as the roll being disappointing and bad, as it was good and met my expectations.\u000a\u000aWagyu Sliders & Sweet Potato Fries ($) - I shared this with my friend. The slider was delicious. Very juicy and the meat was so incredibly tender. It comes on a pretzel type bread which is presented with great care. The fries were very yummy and a delicious alternative to plain-ol French fries.\u000a\u000aTexas Blackberry Lemondrop - Off of their specialty cocktail menu this drink was recommended to me by the bartender. It is a beautiful magenta color served in a martini glass with a mint leaf on top. The drink is very refreshing without a harsh alcohol flavor. I doubt it will get you anywhere near being drunk, but it's still a nice concoction.\u000a\u000aOverall: Food, while good was not perfect. However, it is definitely high ranking. The bartender's service was also pleasant and I believe my friend and I had a nice time here. The lighting is a bit dim, but once you're inside for a bit you do adjust. \u000a\u000aI want to go back to try a full-out meal (and definitely try their butterfish I hear so much about!)

VI have been a fan of Metro Pizza since I was in high school. I'm  now 26. So, take that into account and note my loyalty to this specific pizza chain in Las Vegas. It's good, thin crust pizza made correctly and just the way I like my pizza. \u000a\u000aAlthough my family tends to order this pizza from Boulder Station and have it delivered to our house, I wanted to review the location on Tropicana because I recently went there with my EX for dinner. First off the place has a nice ambiance, and it BIG, and you don't feel cramped while you're having your pizza. I find that a lot of pizza joints tend to be small, loud, and often full of children running about. I realize pizza is an obvious go-to for families, but sometimes you just don't want to deal with that. Anyway, there were still a lot of families around us, but it wasn't irritating since they were plenty far away.\u000a\u000aAs for the service: we were seated right away, didn't wait, and our waitress got our drink orders right off the bat. I had a glass of wine, EX had a beer. We ordered a Large for the TWO of us, of course, this was my EX's idea, not mine. So we had PLENTY to take home, in fact - half a pizza. We ordered off-menu, meaning we just made up what we wanted on the pizza: pepperoni, sausage, and jalapenos. \u000a\u000aMy only complaint: our waitress took a long time to come around and give us our check. It was very apparent we were both done eating as we had put our napkins on our plates and had pushed them away. I even gave her "the look" or tried to at least, a couple times. We were on a schedule because we were going to catch a movie after dinner. Anyway, I think she might have assumed we were having a long dinner since we probably looked like we were on a date. So, no hard feelings for that. Like I said, I am an avid fan of Metro Pizza and I recommended it to everyone I know!

VWhat has happened to Metro Pizza? Have they expanded too far around the valley? Have they put too much effort into Lulu's? I'm not sure, but the pizza I ordered from here was pretty dang bad. \u000a\u000aOn a busy weekend running chores my husband and I decided, hey, let's get pizza. So I called in an order to Metro Pizza. Pretty simple: large pizza, ham, and mushrooms. The lady told me it would be ready in 30 minutes for pick-up. Perfect!\u000a\u000aWe picked it up with no problem, got it home and sat down to eat. First off, I realize we had to drive it home, but it was luke-warm when we opened the box. I have this feeling it had been cooked WAY before the 30 minute pick-up time indicated and had been sitting around for us to actually get there for it.\u000a\u000aThe dough went from crusty-super-crunchy on the crust of the pizza, to doughy-soft at the inside of the pizza. The cheese, to me, was disappointing, clumpy and not good. This pizza was just plain: not good.\u000a\u000aI hate to do it, because I love Metro. I have for a long time. But, I am sad to say their quality may be slipping. Best Pizza in Vegas? Nah, not anymore.

VAre you kidding me with this place? \u000a\u000aI stopped in at Memphis BBQ because I was on a lunch break and I've been exploring this new part of town where I'm training for work. I figured I would pop in and just see how long a to-go order would take. Apparently not long... dependent upon what you happened to order. But they have a take-out menu located by the cashier area, so they must get a lot of take-outs anyway. The restaurant seemed quiet to me, but it could have been because it was just a  weird time of the day.\u000a\u000aI ended up ordering the "King" pulled-pork sandwich, which comes with two sides. I opted for french fries because I have been taking a medication that makes me sick unless I have a really big, hefty meal, and I decided to go lighter with my second side and got the cucumber salad (which the menu says is seasonal). Okay, so I sit back and wait.\u000a\u000aMy meal comes out fairly quickly in a big styrofoam container and I make my way back to work. When I open my container I am greeted by fries and my sandwich wrapped in tinfoil. When I open the tinfoil... I couldn't have been more disappointed. This sandwich looked like it came slopped out of a school cafeteria - NOT a championship BBQ joint. Oh and the taste was the same. The bun was some horrible white-bread concoction I could get at a cheap company picnic. The meat had no flavor... no BBQ flavor at all! They did give me a container of sauce which I immediately dumped all over the meat, but it didn't have a kick to it... it was just kind of blah. The cucumber salad was not refreshing. It was soaked in a very, very sweet slime-sauce. I felt like I was eating straight-up high fructose corn syrup (and I probably was). The fries were uneventful, just fries, nothing more.\u000a\u000aI highly doubt I would give Memphis BBQ another try. I'd probably just go to Famous Dave's if I wanted mediocre BBQ.

VIt's a Chipotle, like all the other Chipotles. Main difference? It's by UNLV, so obviously the lines can get a little out of control during the semester. I tend to hit this one up during the times when UNLV is not in session. Even though it can get busy the lines does move quickly, after all it's pretty much a no-brainer menu if you've been here enough times.\u000a\u000aI tend to always get a chicken burrito, black beans, little sprinkle of cheese, dash of sour cream, and a bunch of lettuce. I'm hardly ever disappointed with Chipotle, after all the ingredients are fresh and the meats are hormone free, etc.\u000a\u000aThe parking here is pretty ridiculous though. I don't know how many times I've pulled in, done a loop and had to end up back out on Maryland Parkway to drive back in and just head to one of the further back lots. \u000a\u000aAnyway, if you need a quick burrito or some other fresh-mex fair and you're in the area hit this place up. I prefer it over the other fast Mexican place which is Cafe Rio down the street.

VTwo experiences, two drinks, two sandwiches... and go to review!\u000a\u000aWell, I ate here two days in a row on my lunch break. Mostly because I was really liking their small sandwich portions paired with a smoothie. I was getting tired of eating huge sandwiches or big meals on my lunch breaks, so the smaller portions from TSC were a better option for me.\u000a\u000aFirst off I've had quite a few smoothies from TCS and although I like most of them I tend to stay away from anything that has pineapple in the name because I think it just makes the smoothie taste weird. My favorite smoothie from here is the one that is mainly blueberries (I forget the name). \u000a\u000aThe food was pretty decent. I have had the Pesto Chicken and the Buffalo Chicken wrap. Is it great? No, not really. But is it okay for the price, plus getting a smoothie to go with it? Yes. \u000a\u000aHowever, the girl working the register the first time I went put me off. She was unprofessional and slightly rude. I was really glad she wasn't working the second day I came here for lunch. \u000a\u000aI like Tropical Smoothie, but I like Jamba Juice better for smoothies in general.

VSmall Starbucks in a business park. It's surrounded by offices so it caters to the people who work in those office buildings. It's much smaller than your normal Starbucks, so don't expect to come here and lay out your laptop, papers, food, and spend a few hours here doing work or relaxing. \u000a\u000aI'm not giving 3 stars for the place, but for the drinks I've gotten from here thus far. Compared to the Starbucks on my side of town, where my drinks always come out pretty much perfect, and the Starbucks on the Air Force Base, where I also frequent, this Starbucks gave me "okay" drinks.\u000a\u000aFor instance yesterday I ordered my typical Non-Fat Ice White Mocha with no whip and I left with it. When I got in my car and was going down the road, I took a sip and thought it tasted way, way too bitter. It almost had a sour undertone to it. \u000a\u000aI understand not every drink is going to come out perfect, but I've yet to receive a perfect drink from this Starbucks.

VI think I may have come here with expectations that were over the top. However, the food here is GOOD, I just don't think it warrants me being a fan of it, or saying this is as good as it gets. This has been a trend with "celebrity chef" restaurants I have eaten at lately. I came here for their "Border Brunch" $29.99 all you can eat breakfast tapas. Plus my friends and I opted for the extra $5 bottomless mimosas.\u000a\u000aI had the orange mimosa, which I am sure I would have enjoyed more had I not drunk myself into a stupor the night previous. It was still a good mimosa though. As for the tapas I tried:\u000a\u000aBreakfast Enchilada - Spicy, spicy! Seriously this thing had some heat. The flavors were good, but I think it gave me heartburn while I was sitting there at the table.\u000a\u000aSkirt Steak & Egg - My second favorite dish. The steak was cooked well, the egg was a nice touch, the guac was good.\u000a\u000aPeruvian Shrimp & Grits - Okay. Is it just me or does it bother anyone else when shrimp is covered in sauce, and yet the tail is still connected, so you have to dig through the sauce, pick up the shrimp and eat it with your fingers because you don't want to be eating shell? This is a good dish though and a surprisingly good combo.\u000a\u000aPancakes - I forget exactly what these were called, but they were basically mini pancakes with a lot of chocolate chips. Pretty much a sugar high on a plate.\u000a\u000aChorizo and Egg Tacos - My favorite dish of all. I kind of wish I had just ordered a bunch of these tacos to be honest. They were just freaking good. And you get two on a plate, so that's a nice touch. Really, I'm thinking about these tacos right now and I WANT THEM.\u000a\u000aAnyway, I just don't think this place warrants its high prices. I feel as though the brunch could be priced $5 cheaper because of the quality of the food. Yes, maybe it's a top chef or whatever, but I just don't think this place feels like a place where I should be shelling out $8 for coffee, which I did not do by the way, even though I was wishing for coffee SO BAD during my meal.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's okay. It's not great, especially when compared to so many other places you can go on the strip, or in Las Vegas in general. Would I come back? Maybe just for the chorizo and egg tacos....

VFor my girls-only brunch in celebration of my 30th birthday I chose Border Grill. I think for it being AYCE and having unlimited mimosas for a few extra bucks it is not a bad option. However, it is still just sitting at "okay" for me based off of a second experience.\u000a\u000aSince I had come here last (2012) they have upped all their prices. What used to be $5 for bottomless mimosas is now $10 (BIG price jump). And what used to be $29.99 AYCE is now $34.99 AYCE. Again, another big price jump.\u000a\u000aAs for the food and what I had....\u000a\u000aChorizo & Egg Taco - Still good, and still one of the better plates on the menu.\u000a\u000aChilaquiles - OK. I've had better elsewhere.\u000a\u000aBananas Foster  Crepe - Not good. Came out luke-warm, and not tasty.\u000a\u000aSalmon Slider - Very good. Salmon smoked nicely, and with the jalapeno bacon and goat cheese, with some spicy sauce, it was delicious. Only down side? The bun was dry.\u000a\u000aEggs Benedict with pork on a biscuit (can't remember the name) - Was actually good, with an over-easy egg to break into the biscuit, mixed with the slow-cooked pork inside was a good combo, but the biscuit was over-powering the meat. Smaller biscuit, or more meat please (more meat would be better).\u000a\u000aI did not indulge in mimosas, however my friend did and they have quite the array of flavors. Although she seemed to enjoy the Peach flavor the most. I did have endless cups of coffee, which is served with sugar and cream.\u000a\u000aService was attentive and congenial, but food was slow to arrive, and some plates went missing, only to appear because our server had to go hunt and find them.\u000a\u000aOverall I think I may have had my fill of Border Grill Brunch and I will have to branch out and find a brunch in Las Vegas that fulfills my needs better.

VWow, I'm excited to find a really good sushi place on the Eastside. It's so convenient. Word to the wise: this place is tiny, tucked into a corner of a strip mall next to Albertson's. If you aren't looking close, you will miss it!\u000a\u000aI was on a mission yesterday to get sushi because I was out on a date with a guy who had never had it before. WHAA? Yes, you heard me right, this boy had never had sushi before. CAH-RAY-ZEE. I was determined to get him on the sushi boat.\u000a\u000aOriginally thought about going to Goyemon, but then realized they wouldn't be open, so I picked this place randomly instead. \u000a\u000aLike I said, it's small, but it's packed. When I walked in I was hit by a bunch of people (literally!). At least I instantly knew it was popular - always a good sign. Even though it was busy we were sat pretty quickly. Our table was wobbly. I think that's my only complaint. I really wanted to ask for a sugar packet to stuff under the table (something I used to do as a server all the time).\u000a\u000aUnfortunately for this review I can only say we had two rolls and an order of edammame. We got the "Kick The Ass" and a California Roll. Don't even fault me for getting the California Roll... I was trying to ease the date into the experience. He liked the California Roll, but was not a fan of the Kick The Ass. However, I loved the Kick The Ass and the edammame was plentiful and very well cooked.\u000a\u000aI definitely want to go back here, they have rolls that looked really good, but I just did not get a chance to eat. Next time, next time!

VUpgraded to 5 stars. I love me some Yama Sushi. This time I went a la solo without my boyfriend. Although it was fun getting him to eat sushi for the first time EVER I got to pick exactly what I wanted this go round without having to worry about a newbie. :)\u000a\u000aI showed up at 11:45 AM this morning (they open at 11:30 AM) and I personally believe this must be the perfect time to hit up this place. It was already kind of busy, but definitely not packed. However I was seated quickly. Their service is phenomenal and the staff is so sweet. \u000a\u000aHere's what I got (I kinda went a little traditional this afternoon): Miso Soup, Cucumber Salad, Spicy Tuna Roll, and one order of Shrimp Sashimi. Everything was perfect. The soup and cucumber salad were refreshing and a nice counter to each other. And my roll was delightful, everything I want a spicy tuna roll to be. Lastly, the shrimp sashimi was very fresh and tasted perfect.\u000a\u000aI love this spot so much now. It's so close to where I live. This may be bad because I crave sushi ALL the time. :)

VFreaking A. I just can't help singing the praises of this place. I stopped in here for lunch this afternoon. It was seriously packed, but I managed to only have to wait for about 5 minutes before I was seated in a back table.\u000a\u000aI was asked quickly for my drink order, and while waiting for my water to arrive at my table, I was asked again if my drink order had been taken. Incredibly awesome service. \u000a\u000aToday I got the miso soup and cucumber salad (again). Yes, I love miso soup and cucumber salad and Yama's is just perfect. I also ordered the 007 Roll. Everything was fresh, everything tasted delicious. I was in and out in about 30 minutes. \u000a\u000aPerfect. Thank you Yama Sushi for giving me wonderous sushi experiences.

VO.M.G. \u000a\u000aMy friends and I just happened to be in the UNLV area after seeing a jazz recital and we were on our way to a little bar we saw in the same plaza as Rincon Catracho. I was starving, my friends had eaten, but I really wanted to have something before we went into the bar to drink. We just so happened to see this place across the parking lot. It has a bright neon sign on the outside of it which says "PUPUSAS". I had never had a pupusa up to this point my life and I decided, hey, I want one! Let's go over there!\u000a\u000aFirst off, the place is not a grab and go, it is actually a restaurant with seats available. This was okay though, I asked if we could get the food to go and the nice waitresses said that would be fine. When I looked at their menu I went directly to the pupusas. They come with just about anything you can imagine inside them. There are veggie-friendly options as well, as my friend is a vegetarian and she got a pupusa with cheese and zucchini. I ordered two pupusas: shrimp and cheese, and a chicken and cheese. I also asked if we could have some tortilla chips while we waited for our food. The waitress immediately brought out some chips (complete with red sauce and a nice cheese topping on them). While we munched on the chips some children ran around the restaurant and I was delighted to see that this place is run by *ahem*non-white people*ahem*. \u000a\u000aWe got our food to go and walked back over to the bar. When you get the pupusas to go the wrap them up on a paper plate and give you a baggy full of cabbage (mine had jalapenos in it) and a baggy of red sauce. Oooh my goodness these pupusas were delicious! They had just the right amount of cheesey, gooey goodness, but not enough to take over the pupusa. And the shrimp one was EXCELLENT. The chicken one was good too, but the shrimp... so fantastic. It was cooked perfectly! I am in love with pupusas now. I wish I had been eating them all along! I will definitely go back here - btw the prices are DIRT CHEAP! We got 3 pupusas and our total was only $8! And they are so filling. You will leave this place and want to go back, I guarantee it!

VI returned to Rincon yesterday to meet my friend for a quick lunch. So now I have had the experience of dining in as well as taking my food to go. In the day this place was just the same as it was when I went a few weeks ago at night. The decor has not changed, nor has the typical patrons. When I arrived my friend was already seated at a booth and there were about 3 or 4 other tables full of people. Being that it was exactly Noon when I arrived I was a little surprised the place wasn't more busy. Perhaps it's the economy (or the gas prices).\u000a\u000aThis time around my friend and I both had pupusas again. My friend ordered the zucchini and cheese (she's a vegetarian). I ordered the shrimp and cheese (yes, I had it again - it's GOOD), and the bean and cheese. Once again the food did not disappoint. For how cheap their prices are and how big and filling the pupusas are it is just a meal you cannot pass up! Everything is melted so deliciously in the pupusas and they are generous with the fillings. I never had a bite that did not have shrimp in it.\u000a\u000aService was a bit slow for my taste. However, the girl working was still very nice. However, I do not believe she knew much English, but hey, you're going to run into that if you want really authentic food like this. Don't worry though, just speak slowly and point at the menu, make sure you repeat things, especially if you're having the food changed in anyway that it is not described in the menu. \u000a\u000aOur total for our meal of 4 Pupusas and a Coke was $8.95 (plus $3 tip). That is as much as you might spend on combo meals at a fast food place and guess what? This food is a thousand times better.

VI have never been to Red Lobster up until this point in my life. I am 27. I never want to go back to Red Lobster ever again.\u000a\u000aI was whisked away to RL over this past weekend for a dinner birthday celebration for my brother. He wanted lobster, my parents immediately thought of RL. I really wish we had gone somewhere else.\u000a\u000aEverything in this place is salted beyond belief. I guarantee you they serve the food this way because they are catering to the general American public and the general American public have an overly iodized taste (in my opinion). I ordered one of their shrimp dishes, and selected the shrimp scampi and seafood stuffed shrimps. YUCK on both accounts. The shrimp "scampi" was coated in butter I'm very certain and it was horrendous. The stuffed shrimps were not any better. My salad came out slathered in ranch dressing (I should have asked for it on the side). The famous little cheddar bay biscuits were okay, but pretty dry.\u000a\u000aThe rest of my family got dishes with lobster tails, and I did have a few bites of the lobster. It was good, but nothing spectacular. However, I really have never had amazing lobster. But I doubt I'll ever get it at RL.\u000a\u000aMy favorite dish was the appetizer we ordered off of the "build your own" appetizer selection. We selected clam strips and mozzarella sticks. Well, it's pretty damn hard to mess up clam strips and I thought they were yummy. I think the mozzarella sticks could have been heated up a BIT more, but they were good none the less.\u000a\u000aOur waitress was very nice, good humored, and very quick. She kept our drinks filled and was an all around champ about getting our food and clearing our plates. However - it was definitely mentioned that my brother was having a birthday - and NOTHING! No complimentary dessert! Seriously, RL? That was just really disappointing.\u000a\u000aNeedless to say I have no intention of ever returning to Red Lobster. If I'm going to throw down money on seafood it better be some effing good seafood and I know I'm not going to get it here.

VOh yes, here we go.\u000a\u000aFor six years I was with Verizon Wireless. I made the switch to their service in Reno, NV when I was still in college. I never had a problem with them. Their service is top-notch. I have always run into very helpful sales people.\u000a\u000aFor the past two years, after extending my contract, I have had automatic bill payment set up for my cell phone. I did this so I would never, ever miss a payment. NEVER. So, since I have auto-pay it is impossible for me to miss a payment, correct? Well, not according to Verizon Wireless.\u000a\u000aJust last month I started doing some shopping around for a new phone, and yes, a new provider. I wanted to explore my options. After doing many calculations on plans and phone types I decided to switch to T-Mobile. It was in the middle of the month so I knew I would have to pay my final bill with Verizon and I had no problem with that.\u000a\u000aSo, I went directly to the store to pay the bill. I thought all was good to go. THEN I get a PAPER BILL in the mail from them. Hmm, thought I, this is strange, I have not gotten a paper bill in the mail for two years. How odd. I decided I better go down to the store and see what was up. I explained my situation to the customer service dude and all seemed okay at first. Then he realized I was not trying to find out my pro-rate because I had come to Verizon from another carrier, but because I had switched to another provider from Verizon. Welp, all of the sudden I was a second class citizen because he straight up tells me, "Well just because you switched carriers doesn't mean you can't pay your bill." AHEM AHEM AHEM! WHAT??!?! I never did NOT pay my bill! \u000a\u000aThis big douche stick then proceeds to tell me I must pay my final bill - in full. Something which I did not think was correct or right, but because I just wanted to leave and be done with it - I paid. I asked him, "This is it, right? No more. I won't hear from you guys again?" and he said yes.\u000a\u000aWell, well, well..... two days pass and I get ANOTHER paper statement from Verizon, this time in very rude CAPS-LOCK letters telling me I have an OVER-DUE BILL and just because I switched carriers does not mean I am not allowed to not pay my bill.\u000a\u000aOh I could have thrown a brick through every Verizon Wireless store in the Las Vegas valley at this point. I called Verizon's Customer Service line and gently, but somewhat heatedly explained my situation and said I just really wanted to make sure I was totally square with the account, that nothing was left. The girl on the line brought up my account and said the balance due was "zero". I asked her why I had started getting paper statements when I never, ever got paper statements before. So she clickity-clacks on her computer and then has the audacity to say to me, "Well you did not make a payment in May." LIKE HELL I DIDN'T MAKE A PAYMENT IN MAY! At this point my head was exploding, and I'm not going to lie - I went off on her. Everything from, why did you send me paper statements, and I've always had auto-pay, and this seems very convenient that your company is trying to screw me when, strangely enough, I have switched to T-Mobile!!\u000a\u000aArrrrrrrgh! I am very careful about my credit score and my payments and to know that Verizon blatantly tried to screw me just because I switched providers is SO ANNOYING! Well, beware of Verizon Wireless is all I can say. If you switch from them you better be very careful how you handle getting everything paid off because apparently they have issues with treating long-time customers nicely when they make a decision to switch to a different service.

VConsidering the location and how long this B&N has been around the store itself is nice. It is in a crowded shopping center with a Best Buy and the fish market as well, so be forewarned, parking is spotty and traffic is congested a lot of the times.\u000a\u000aOverall the store is still quite nice. The books are typically all organized. There is even a Starbucks inside, which adds an aroma of coffee, which I love. \u000a\u000aEven though this store is in a kind of janky area of town the less than desirables typically do not frequent the book store. There's also always a security person standing right inside the door. Props to B&N for that - I think that keeps certain people from even bothering to come into the book store. Also, they keep their Nooks directly in front of the door, so I can imagine the employees can't constantly be making sure no one is making off with them.\u000a\u000aI like this B&N since it is close to home. When I feel like browsing books and I don't want to waste gas, this is where I come.

VThis small bike shop is located on the East side of town, which provides nice bikes for lower prices than what you will find elsewhere in the valley. As of late my husband and I have gotten into biking. My husband knows more about it than I do, but that's because I just want to ride, he wants to mountain bike and jump, and etc. Well, well since we've been getting into bikes I've been here twice.\u000a\u000aBoth experiences were great. The staff here is knowledgeable and they know their inventory. They also have a service department. \u000a\u000aI did not buy a bike here because I actually found one elsewhere for less money. Considering I am a novice mountain biker I did not want to spend *too* much money on my first bike. Of course, I had no idea bikes could go from $200 to $10,000. But. They can.\u000a\u000aI would certainly return here, especially since it is so close to where I live. I don't know if this is a chain, or locally run, either way it's a good place to go if you're looking for a bike or you need to service your bike.

VI have been to Alternate Reality twice now and each of my visits were awesome. On my second visit yesterday Ralph the owner was working and he is a very nice and knowledgeable guy. \u000a\u000aI really like AR because you can tell the shop takes a lot of pride in itself. It is always clean and everything is very accessible and organized. Although, sometimes I can't reach things on the top shelves because I'm short, hee hee! But that's okay, I've never had a problem asking for help to get something that's way over my head. :)\u000a\u000aThe two times I've been I went directly here for a specific comic and found both easily! \u000a\u000aI love their selection and the location. I really can't give enough accolades to this particular comic book store. Highly recommend!

VHow can I not give 5 stars when a sandwich shop serves up a sandwich I'm still thinking about after I ate it hours ago? I'm talking about the Bobbie just like everyone else here. I had heard rumors of this delicious sandwich but I was skeptical.\u000a\u000aThank you Capriotti's for delivering on the promise of Thanksgiving in a  sandwich! I think the thing that it did for me was the stuffing. It was perfectly seasoned. I'm not a huge fan of cranberry - but I LOVED it in this sandwich. The crunchy, yet soft bread, delicious turkey, perfectly seasoned stuffing, with a little salty, and little sweet from the cranberry - oh, I just.... I think I want another one. NO - I KNOW I want another one!\u000a\u000aI thought the staff here was nice too, and even though it was busy when I walked in I felt as though they were handling it well. I'm pretty sure they get a lot of business with their location being so close to the strip and the employees exemplify the fact that they're used to this kind of bustle of people.\u000a\u000aWill I be back? Yes, absolutely.

VConsidering the location this IHOP stands out as one of the better ones in Las Vegas. I think its proximity to the Strip lends a hand to how busy it is most of the time. You can come in this IHOP any day of the week and at any time and you will find quite a few patrons. \u000a\u000aI've been here late at night after clubbing on a few occasions (many years ago). Most recently I went with my husband for a mid-morning breakfast on Saturday. It was busy, they had all the sections open and plenty of wait-staff to attend to the amount of patrons.\u000a\u000aI ordered an omelet of some kind, my husband ordered something similar. IHOP's menu doesn't change much, besides their addition of specials, which usually run congruently to whatever kid's movie is out at the time. \u000a\u000aOur food was decent, came out quick enough and the waitress was nice. Overall, it was a generic IHOP visit that I am sure is within its corporate restaurant standards.

VThis is an okay place to find cheap designer clothing. I ventured here to find some work clothes because I dislike paying extravagant prices for clothes I could care less about. I mean, I want to look good for work, but um, it's work and I'm not trying to impress anyone there. After all, they already hired me and I'm married so meh! \u000a\u000aBut alas, sometimes we must make an effort, so Marshalls to the rescue! The store itself is kind of messy, but less junky than Ross in my opinion. I think it's because the racks are lower and look more like a normal big-box shopping store.\u000a\u000aSelection was okay. But typically Ross has much more selection in the dress department with much more varying prices.\u000a\u000aI did pick up a few nice, key items - grey capri-slacks, a striped boat-neck shirt, a nice flowy blue shirt I can wear for work and outside of work (yay!), but no shoes, which was kind of disappointing. They did have shoes, but kind of pricey in my opinion for it being Marshalls.\u000a\u000aOverall I would return in the event I needed some more work clothes.

VGet past the crowd of UNLV students, or just come during the off-hours of their typical hours of drinking, and overlook the often slow service.\u000a\u000aDo these things and you will enjoy Crown & Anchor for what it is... an actual traditional British Pub in Las Vegas. I will be the first to admit I have never been to a real British pub, like say, in London, but hey if this is the closest I can get right now, so be it. \u000a\u000aI suggest Fish and Chips and it is typically what I get when I come here, although I have had a few other selections, this is certainly my go to and it's good, EVERY TIME.It's fish, it's chips, it comes with great tartar sauce if you want it. \u000a\u000aNot to mention the beer selection. It's works for me. I think everyone should come here at least once.

VI never leave Buffalo Exchange with something I don't love. I usually go here for summer dresses or shoes. Those are the two things I spend a majority of my "retail money" on. I don't shop for jeans, slacks, shirts, etc. here just because I do my t-shirt shopping online, and my professional clothes shopping at much "nicer" places.\u000a\u000aBut BE never does me wrong when I am on the prowl for summer dresses. I recently went to find a dress for a friend's wedding and I was successful! They have huge selection of Medium-sized dresses. Always go through all the racks of your size - I'm serious! Even if I find something I love I continue to go through the rest of the rack in case something else catches my eye. Also, usually I can find two things I like equally, but one is less expensive, as was the case with the dress I found for my friend's wedding.\u000a\u000aI have never come here to sell clothes, but you can do that as well. I don't know how much they give or anything like that. Typically I give my used clothes away to Goodwill or other such places so I'll probably never know.\u000a\u000aIf you have the time to go through the racks and you like the whole used/vintage thing then I definitely suggest checking out Buffalo Exchange.

VUpdate on Buffalo Exchange. For the first time I went to BE to sell clothes a few days ago. I had some items that were just not being worn and felt as though I could get a few bucks for them. \u000a\u000aFirst off, don't take your clothes here unless they are really new or totally out-dated (as in vintage...). They won't take anything else. They are incredibly picky. Forget about trying to sell them anything preppy, classic, romantic, or very nice business. I guess they just don't take that stuff because their clientele doesn't buy it. Or, as I was told "These styles don't move". Your best bet is with boho and very trendy "right now" clothes. I find it kind of funny that they won't sell much else because most teenagers (who buy that kind of stuff) would refuse to step foot in BE. Okay, that's a bit of an over-reaching statement, but you get where I am getting at, right?\u000a\u000aI also dislike how they have expanded so much of their store to men's wear as well. I'm not against men's wear, but I just didn't think it warranted that much space. \u000a\u000aAlso to note, although they won't take "nicer" clothing (as in higher-up fancy labels, which my clothes were) they did jump on my never-used Coach wristlet, yet only wanted to offer me $6 for it! HA HA HA. Ya right. I'll go sell it on ebay for way more than that.\u000a\u000aOverall I think they are WAY too picky and the quality of this establishment has gone down since I've been here last. Maybe it's just that I'm getting older and my style is changing, who knows. Either way, I still have to bring down my original review of 5 stars to 3. This place is only okay. I think I would rather visit a Patty's Closet.

VDiscount Tires on Maryland Parkway has been my go-to place for my tires for years. I had a rear tire that was extremely low and decided I better get it to the shop.\u000a\u000aOf course, I had let it go way too long and the tire was useless. Had to be replaced! However, they let me know they had to order the tire. I gave them a call on the day they said it would be in and they told me to come on down! I showed up about 20 minutes later and they took my car right away.\u000a\u000aThe staff is very nice here and they did not try to get me to buy anything else or pull a fast one on me. Also, they remembered to put my VW's tire lock back in the place where I told them they could find it. I have had people forget before and then I had to buy a brand new one and those things are not cheap.\u000a\u000aIt's nice that they drive your car right up to the door when it is done. They call you and it is already running right there for you with the door open, AC on, and ready to go. Very, very good customer service here.

VI was hoping Cuba Cafe would be a knock-out because it is so close to home, but it came in at just A-OK after my husband and I made a special trip here to use a Restaurant.com coupon I've been holding onto for awhile now. \u000a\u000aIn the past I have not had a lot of experience with Cuban food save for the couple times I have been to Havana Grill (which is in Henderson). The couple times I had had it I really enjoyed it, and was hoping Cuba Cafe would produce some of those same feelings. \u000a\u000aLet's start with the fact that the place could use a serious face lift. When we walked in I thought we had entered an Elks Lodge dining area. Have any of you out there been in an Elks Lodge with a dining area and a bar? Do you KNOW what I'm talking about? Anyway, besides the Elks Lodge feel it is also very PURPLE... purple walls, purple table clothes, purple curtains... man, I haven't seen that much purple in a long time. So the ambiance is less than appealing. How about service?\u000a\u000aThere were two people manning the floor - what appeared to be the waitress/hostess and a busser. However, the busser handled the majority of the tables. He brought our drinks, refilled our drinks, brought our food, asked us how everything was, cleared our plates. The only thing he did not do was to take our order and deliver the check. I couldn't decide who our actual server was, but the girl waitress/hostess wasn't very congenial, except for when I asked for our fried plantains to be brought out before the other food...\u000a\u000aSpeaking of food. We ordered the fried plantains as our appetizer. My husband described them as "Tasting like an onion ring on the outside and not-ripe-enough banana on the inside". He was right. The plantains were not what I was hoping for. As for main dishes I got the bistec sandwich, which is a piece of flat steak pressed with tomato, lettuce, and little potatolings that are fried with a sauce of sorts. This was a pretty good sandwich, but I wish the steak had not been as chewy/sinewy as it was. My husband, who wasn't into the whole "Cuban food" idea ordered the chicken sandwich, which was basically exactly like my bistec.\u000a\u000aOur other side was french fries and they are nice a fat, crispy, none of them were soggy, actually quite enjoyable.\u000a\u000aOverall with the purple dining experience and the not-so-amazing food I have to go with 3 stars. The place isn't bad and maybe I should have ordered something else, perhaps the "ropa" meat dish everyone exclaims about, but I wasn't hungry enough for a full plate. This place is so close to home I am not going to say I won't be back, but I don't think it was good enough to have me running back for seconds right away.

VWow is all I have to say about the reviews for this place. Just seriously.... REALLY??\u000a\u000aThis Vons may be in a slightly "ghetto" area of town, but the store is perfectly fine and the staff is incredibly nice. In fact, the only reason this Vons could be considered "ghetto" is because of the snippy college students frequenting it for their beer runs and mini-fridge stuffing.\u000a\u000aAny time I have ever run into this store on the way home from work I have been asked if I needed help finding something and the cashiers are friendly too.\u000a\u000aIf you think this Vons is "ghetto" please go and visit the K-Mart on Bonanza and Nellis. PUH-LEASE! Get it together people. This store is remodeled, ya, it's kind of old, but at least it is clean. The alcohol section is glorious and maybe it doesn't have a bakery, but there IS a bakery located in the same exact shopping center as this Vons. Get yo bread on there.

VFor being in the nicer part of town this place was kind of dumpy. I happened to spot it while on the look out for a decent place to grab a quick bite to eat during my lunch hour. It's actually located in the Albertson's shopping center.\u000a\u000aWhen I went in the place looked disheveled. The salsa bar had not been wiped down, there was drippings everywhere. It looked as though the dining area had not been wiped down either. \u000a\u000aNext, I wanted to keep on their "value menu" so I ordered a taco al carbon, which they are pretty good. I also ordered the value menu side salad. I specifically said "side salad", which to me would indicate the fact I want a SIDE SALAD. Well, I didn't get a side salad, the cashier charged me for the salad that is $3.49. I didn't realize it until I sat down and looked at my receipt. But by this time I was just like, "Eff it, I'll eat a bigger salad". Nothing wrong with more veggies in my opinion.\u000a\u000aFood - eeehhh. The salad was not cold like a salad should be. It was kind of strange temperature-wise, like maybe the salad had been siting out and someone forgot to put it back into cool-storage. Or maybe they're running their temps for the salad prep station too high. Either way, it was not good.\u000a\u000aI'd say be wary of the salad items here... something fishy is going on...

VWow. Total re-do/double-take Batman! This place has had a facelift and it's a very good facelift indeed. The last time I trekked to this Roberto's it was probably 4 or 5 years ago. I remember it being a kind of greasy taco shop in need of a major upgrade. Ya, the food was okay, and the place was... eh.\u000a\u000aBut I came here today for a torta and the shop is really nice. The tables are clean and the entire kitchen has been turned around. The employees are nice too and my food was served up quick. I was the only one there at the time.\u000a\u000aI ordered a carne asada torta with everything. I enjoyed this torta. I felt as though it was well made, like they actually put thought into it. I have had so many tortas that I felt were just thrown together and the guac was dripping out the sides, the pico was all runny and gross. But not this torta! It helps that it was wrapped up very tightly in the waxy-paper and then the aluminum foil. Plus the bread was hefty. It wasn't a light bread. Therefore, even though the sandwich is juicy, the bread is holding up to it. I have had a lot of tortas when I got to the bottom I just tossed the damn thing because the bread was SO mushy and gross. Not this torta. The bread was only just a bit of mush, so I could eat it with no problem.\u000a\u000aI didn't realize this Roberto's had had a little renaissance. Now that I know, I'll probably be back more than once every 4 years.

VI'm reviewing Guadalajara because it seems to be the haunt of my family. Meaning, if we're having any sort of celebration for any family member that is not myself, we end up going here. I guess my parents aren't that apt to try new things, so the easy way out is mediocre Mexican at the local casino.\u000a\u000aLook, it's not bad, but it's not great either. It is your typical Mexican fair. They have combos, burritos, dinner plates, appetizers, and seafood specials as well. Normally I go for a combo or get a burrito (usually the carne asada, because it's pretty good here, although not spectacular). \u000a\u000aMargaritas: Eh, they're okay and I guess the prices are okay (between $6-$9). I had a Chambord 1800 Margarita, which was actually pretty tasty. However, I also had the Cherry Lime Margarita which tasted nothing like tequila and made me think this is what hairspray must taste like if it were watered down and put in a glass. \u000a\u000aLastly - their chips have never disappointed me. Always warm, and they are quick to refill your basket if they notice you're running low. Plus there is a salsa bar that provides different salsa and bean dips. Try the dark one (I think it says it is a mild), but it has a very distinctive smokey flavor that really does add some depth to the palate (I know, who says that? But it's true!).\u000a\u000aOverall I enjoy this place. Would I go here if I weren't with my family? Probably not. But like I said, it is what it is, and that is A-OK.

VOnce again the Mexican restaurant in Stations casinos has changed hands. No longer Guadalajara, but Cabo now.\u000a\u000aMy fiance and I decided to stop in here late on Friday night after I got off work. I really wanted a margarita to celebrate the completion of my training. \u000a\u000aWe waited... A lot. We waited for the hostess to show up. We waited for chips. We waited for drinks... Lots of waiting.... I waited for a water I ordered that never came. So I drank my fiance's. We were never asked if we wanted a refill of our chip basket.\u000a\u000aThe poor girl serving us seemed frazzled. The busboy was of very little help.\u000a\u000aThe food was mediocre. My margarita was the star of the night. It was very good and blended well. They did honor the check-in policy and we got sopapillas, which we took to go.\u000a\u000aI don't know why Stations Casinos keep changing their restaurants... But this change was not for the better. The only thing I'd come back for is another raspberry margarita.

VIf I could say "meh" to Italian food I would say it a thousand times over about the food at Pasta Cucina. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.\u000a\u000aMy mother received a coupon for Pasta Cucina in the mail and we figured it was a good enough deal to get us in. I'm weary of Italian places because I just feel like a lot of them are overpriced and not very good. Hmm, my inklings continue to prove me right. \u000a\u000aLet's begin with service - lackluster and cold. The BIOTCH waitress who served us was just terrible. And yes, she was indeed a BIOTCH in all rights. She knew we had a coupon and we didn't order her much pushed on us wine. Therefore we were done, for her, by the time we ordered our raspberry iced teas. Everything else about her service to use was electronic and rude.\u000a\u000aFood - the raspberry iced tea was incredibly too sweet. I felt like I was drinking tea spiked with Hi-C fruit punch. Terrible for a "nice" restaurant to serve such a drink. I ordered the Tuscan Angel Hair Pasta with Chicken (add $2). The plate was being overtaken with angel hair, and all the other ingredients were lost. The dish boasted pine nuts - I think I got a total of five in the whole dish. Instead of lovely combo of flavors, which the dish should have been, it was just a mound of angel hair with some chicken pieces thrown on it. My mother ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, a dish that is wonderfully traditional, and which she loves. The meatballs were large and they were good. The sauce was decent, but alas - my mother asked to have the normal spaghetti replaced with angel hair and guess what? She got regular spaghetti.\u000a\u000aBy this point we were stuffed and had only eaten not even half of our dishes (they're just HUGE). We got to-go bags and received our bill. If I had been paying the waitress would have gotten half the tip my mother left her. \u000a\u000aI will not return to Pasta Cucina. Overpriced Italian food restaurant strikes again.

VI've been to this Verizon twice. Once was to inquire about having a joint plan with my husband several months ago, the second was recently to actually make the switch.\u000a\u000aI find most cell phone companies to be about the same, but Verizon does have exceptional coverage. Since my husband is already with Verizon we decided to keep his plan, add me to his plan, and get rid of my T-Mobile plan. The great thing about switching services these days is the ability of the new provider to just do it for you. All I did was provide my account number.\u000a\u000aThis place was busy when we arrived. Luckily the staff is very competent and quick to engage new customers to find out what they need and put them on a wait list. Honestly I don't think we waited more than about 20ish minutes. \u000a\u000aBoth the ladies who helped us were very friendly and knowledgeable. It seemed as though our switch was easy-peasy for them to do. That's a good sign of superior customer service.\u000a\u000a Overall I'm very pleased with our experience here.

VDan Dee is the best. They've been around forever and have been my family's go to dry cleaning service for many years. \u000a\u000aThe owners are a couple and they are very nice. You always walk away feeling happy after dropping off your dry cleaning! \u000a\u000aI also dry clean my husband's Air Force uniform here, so, honestly it's a place where you can trust your clothes won't go missing.\u000a\u000aIn this fast paced world it's nice to find a simple place like this where you trust the owners and enjoy every experience you have. It may just be dry cleaning, but hey, it's important!

VDan Dee has recently undergone some changes. \u000a\u000aMr. Lee and his wife are no longer running the store. I am not sure what has happened to them, but I have heard some rumors. Fortunately, a family member of theirs is still running the place, so it's still in the family, which is nice.\u000a\u000aThe customer service is still great, and the gentleman running the front end has installed a computer cash register (no more hand-written slips). You get a printed out receipt from the cash register when you leave. They also now have customer database you can be placed in. \u000a\u000aMost recently I dropped off some business clothing I needed for an interview. All three pieces came out beautifully. When I eventually leave Las Vegas I will be on the look out for a dry cleaner like Dan Dee.

VQuizno's is Quizno's pretty much. \u000a\u000aThis one is located in a strip mall off of Flamingo. It's right next to a Zaba's Mexican Grill. The parking lot is a zoo during lunch hours. \u000a\u000aThe inside is clean. The staff is friendly. I've only stopped in once after work to grab a sandwich to go. The sandwich was decently made. I asked for extra banana peppers and I received them. Strangely enough I saw that this Quiznos had a bottle of the Batch 88 sauce out. I haven't see the Batch 88 sauce out at the Quizno's that is closer to my house. I love that stuff. Remember when Quizno's used to have a little bar where they had the sauce and banana peppers and other sauces so you could grab them at your convenience? I do. But I never see that little bar in Quizno's anymore.\u000a\u000aOverall - they make decent sandwiches, they complied to my add ons with no fuss, and the store was clean (from what I saw of it), can't complain, it's a decent place.

VI didn't really think I'd ever be reviewing a bank, but this is the bank I frequent the most out of all the Wells Fargo's in Vegas. My checking account and savings account are through them. Although I am seriously considering switching all my finances over to USAA in the near future, I must say I don't mind Wells Fargo for now. They're doing all right for me, as far as big, corporatized banks go.\u000a\u000aThis one is small, located next to Albertsons and CVS Pharmacy. It can be busy, but they do tend to have plenty of tellers to compensate for when it does get a bit crazy. \u000a\u000aI've noticed many of the employees here recognize me since I have been coming in to deposit my checks for awhile. The ones that do recognize me are always very nice and chit-chatty. They also tend to welcome you when you walk in and bid you a farewell when you leave. It's pretty nice of them and it's a nice change from hearing about how bad banks are. At least the employees at the banks can make you feel happy about coming somewhere to put your monies!

VWashing Soap. They have it. If you're trying to do natural cleaning or make your own cleaners you will find washing soap here. - That is the entire reason I came to Ace Hardware, but now that I have been here I will probably be back for anything I may need "hardware" or "gardening"-wise.\u000a\u000aThis small store reminds me of days gone by. Yes, it may be a chain, but it is not Home Depot or Lowes. HD and Lowes overwhelm me most of the time, the tall, forever reaching shelves, the sterile concrete floors, the orange-clad employees running around, dodging most customers because in actuality - they do not have much experience in say, lighting or well, building shit, they're just there to make a buck, which I'm not saying is bad for them, it's just bad for business when your employees don't know much about the products. \u000a\u000aAce is different, it's smaller, it has that "hometown" vibe. At least this one does. I feel like I can deal with this store. I don't feel like I have to be pressured into re-doing my bathroom because my fixtures are out of date and the floor models look uber-fancy. I can easily navigate the small aisles, I don't have to be wandering around a warehouse-sized store looking for the correct bug spray for an hour.\u000a\u000aI recommend Ace Hardware if you are tired of the warehouse stores. You won't find power-tools here or building supplies, but if you're a novice or you just need odds and ends around the house this store will do fine.

VThis Leslie's has been around FOR-E-VER. I'm not entirely sure how long, but ever since I can remember they've had this location, and I'm 28, so take that into account. I think they have prime location. Around a lot of older neighborhoods where every other house has a pool in the backyard. Not to mention these pools need maintenance.\u000a\u000aI've dropped in here on a few occasions to get necessities for my pool. It's nothing really fun or cool, unless I pick up some floatie pool toys or something.\u000a\u000aThe customer service is pretty on par most of the time. Sometimes things seem a bit pricey, but there's only so many places you can buy pool supplies. The convenience factor for me usually wins out over price.

VThis Lee's is a bit on the smallish side, but fortunately it is PACKED with wine, which is why I came. They do have a decent selection that will make sure you get what you came for and if not, probably a very good equivalent.\u000a\u000aThe craft beer section looked a bit measly to me as I scanned it, but I really wasn't there for beer. I picked up a Moscato and a Riesling, both of which were decently priced and one of which was a "Managers Pick". \u000a\u000aI did not go over the hard liquor section so I cannot comment on it.\u000a\u000aService was quick and at about 9 PM on a Saturday night they had three cash registers open. Hey, at least there wasn't a wait!

VGod I love Mexican food and it doesn't get any better than Lindo. I have been here so many times and it is a Las Vegas staple. I had my 18th birthday here. I have taken people here just for the specific purpose of introducing them to the incredibly flavorful, spicy salsa. The amazing Coca-Cola Carnitas. The oyster appetizers and the FANTASTIC made right at your table guacamole. Oh - they make it to your specifications!\u000a\u000aAdd on top of all this a great mixed drink selection. Original margaritas are ALWAYS good. The meats are all marinated and delicious. One of my favorites to get is the pork with green chili sauce. HEAVEN ON YOUR TASTEBUDS.\u000a\u000aThey are BUSY on Friday and Saturday nights, just so you are aware. The lines can often go out the door. However, even without reservations the staff at Lindo are quickly helping get people in the door and in seats, rather than standing around waiting for food.\u000a\u000aThe ambiance can be a bit loud if you are here on busy nights because they tend to get large parties and remember - there could be a loud mariachi band playing right next to your table at times.\u000a\u000aThe last time I came here our waiter was great. Our chips were never not filled. Our drinks were consistently refilled and our meals were delicious. I ate almost ALL of my food, which is crazy, but I was hungry. \u000a\u000aIf I could eat here all the time, I would, but um... I can't because I don't want to weigh 350 lbs.

VPass. Not the best breakfast or lunch place, by the way they are only open until 3 PM. \u000a\u000aThis "50's style" Omelet House is located in a skeezy kind of strip mall on the East side of town off of Desert Inn. My husband and I have driven by it countless times and once we tried to stop and eat here one evening, but then realized it closed at 3 PM. We kept saying we'd go back and try it, so we did when my in-laws were in town.\u000a\u000aThe diner itself is run-down. Seats and tables look worn, so does the floor. Their menus are terrible! I mean they're floppy pieces of decaying crap honestly. Seriously, get new menus. \u000a\u000aThe omelet selection I must admit IS extensive. I believe there were about 30 different omelets to choose from? My husband had an omelet though, the "Pigskin" and he was not impressed. He said it tasted like fake eggs! I had the cheeseburger with french fries (you can decide between salad, soup, or fries). I thought the burger was nothing special. I asked for grilled onions and they were on the burnt - not grilled - side. My father-in-law got the club sandwich, he didn't say much about it. My mother-in-law got the turkey/guac sandwich. She said the guac had a weird flavor to it (but not spicy). She also had the mushroom soup, which is homemade, she said it was very good. \u000a\u000aThe one thing that is redeeming is the fact that the waitress was really, really nice. She gave us samples of their fried potato slices AND got my mother-in-law a sample of the guac before she ordered the sandwich. She was also quick to pick up plates, ask us how everything was.\u000a\u000aBut... I doubt I will return. My husband was really not impressed, neither was I.

VI really just couldn't believe there weren't more reviews for this salon. Well, I suppose it is because it is on the East side of Las Vegas, an area that gets no love and no attention. But hey - I live on the East side and I can understand why. \u000a\u000aHowever, just because this salon isn't in some posh stylish area of town doesn't mean they don't do a great job. I have been here twice and will be back again and again as long as I live in Vegas. My stylist, "David English" (and I ask him by that name on purpose) is absolutely fantastic. On both occasions David shampooed and conditioned my hair. He listened to exactly how I wanted it to be done and he did a lovely job. I am usually kind of skeptical and antsy about how I want my hair to turn out and I like to give the stylist an idea and let them run with it. Some stylists I've been to in the past get freaked out by this notion and demand I tell them exactly what I want. Well, David definitely didn't and I am grateful to him for that! \u000a\u000aI guess the only downside is the location (but it's good because it is close to me!!) and you aren't going to be served a non-alcoholic martini here or given a pedicure while you wait - but honestly when I'm looking for a good haircut I don't care where it comes from as long as I love the outcome the place produces and Allure certainly does that!

VI know, really, I'm writing a review of McDonald's? Well, there is a good reason. I always pass this McDonald's when I work at a convention on the strip. It's just on my way. I do not eat a whole lot of McDonald's, but sometimes those Golden Arches just call to you.\u000a\u000aUsually when I am on my way to work it is early morning and I have just run out of the door and I haven't eaten anything. I tend to swing through this McDonald's through the drive-thru. Usually I just get a coffee (I do have an affinity for their coffee btw), but sometimes I get the breakfast burritos. I won't lie, I'm addicted to these things. Um, I'm not even sure what is really in them, but I really don't care.\u000a\u000aAnyway, my experience with their drive-thru staff is always awesome. When it is early in the morning and the McDonald's employees are still being really nice and happy I think that is a good thing. So props to this Mickey D's, you've earned my admiration even if you are a fast food establishment!

VFirst off, I went to Casa Don Juan on St. Patrick's Day for a pre-game meal since I would be drinking heavily. I assumed Mexican food would be a good pre-cursor to getting totally hammered. What can I say? I like to think ahead now that I'm in my "late" 20s.\u000a\u000aBeing that is was Thursday and an Irish holiday the place actually had quite a few people in it. Also, it was much bigger than I had first thought. Plenty of seating in booths and tables. And there was a party table set up next to our table - so obviously they can handle large groups well. \u000a\u000aWhen we first sat down we were told about the drink specials (Midori Maragaritas, two for $6.99!!) Amazing. I am assuming it was a St. Patty's Day special (being that they were green), but I would also assume since they had such a great drink special for St. Patty's Day they probably have a decent happy hour and other drink specials. The margaritas were good, a little on the sweet side for me though, but I can contribute that to the Midori, and probably a larger than usual amount because they were wanting to make them GREEN. \u000a\u000aOn to the food - they have a typical Mexican menu. Burritos, fish dishes, and combo plates. I had the "wet burrito" with steak. I thought it was pretty delicious and ate almost all of it. The thing was huge. HUGE. They also offer burritos that are not "wet" - this means there is sauce poured on top of the burrito. Oh, but just as a side note I thought the sauce could have used a BIT more flavor other than tomato taste. But that's a small complaint considering the burrito itself was pretty tasty and they did not skimp on the meat. As another plus - the food came out incredibly quickly, which is usually a staple of Mexican dining, so kudos to them for the quick turn around.\u000a\u000aI will go back here I think, especially since I'd like to see what other drink specials they may have. Oh, as a side note, it IS downtown on Main Street. So, if you're not used to being downtown and in this particular area of town you may find it a bit seedy. It's okay though, the restaurant is on a main road and the parking lot is well lit. The food and ambiance of the place definitely makes up for the location!

VOn my return trip to Casa don Juan I have been somewhat let down. My first visit seemed magical and quirky because I went to eat Mexican on St. Patrick's Day. But alas, it was not meant to be!\u000a\u000aOn a Monday afternoon I took an out of town friend to the thrift/antique store district downtown. We just wanted to kill some time and thought it would be fun. Well, we also were in need of a late afternoon lunch and Casa don Juan was just right there, so we headed over!\u000a\u000aI was singing their praises - and then we got a basket of cold chips. Boo! They still brought out bean dip with the chips though, along with salsa, so they have that going for them. Then we put in our drink order, and waited, and waited, and waited. Finally the bus boy came with my iced tea and my friend's water. Already my praises were looking bad.\u000a\u000aMy friend went for the chimichanga, and I was torn between getting a torta or the wet burrito. I went for the wet burrito. It certainly was not as good as I remember it. I'm not sure what was wrong, but there was just something mediocre about it. There wasn't much carne asada, the rice and beans were slopped all around inside the burrito and not very well put together. The guac they just unceremoniously slopped on the top of the burrito was halfway spilling off my plate when I got the meal. It just looked like whoever was back there in the kitchen was not paying attention. I mean, it was still good, and yes, my friend did like his chimichanga, but I felt so bad about hyping this place up so much to be so very disappointed.\u000a\u000aMaybe on St. Patrick's Day they were much more on their game and perhaps the chef wasn't being such a slop that day. I'm not sure. But now I'm not so sure I would go back to Casa don Juan. So sad.

VCasa don Juan and I have had an up and down relationship in the past. The first time I came here I loved it, second time I was disappointed. It's been about two years (honest to goodness, really TWO YEARS?! time flies.) that I've been back.\u000a\u000aAfter checking out the new bar down the street (which I will review later) my friend and I were having drunk hunger pains. I was in the mood for Mexican and was contemplating El Gordo, but since Casa don Juan was in perfect walking distance we decided to dine-in here once again.\u000a\u000aLet's begin with pricing - I think theirs stinks big time. Look, most Mexican places in Vegas are traditionally not hard on your wallet. You can usually get a combo plate in the 10 buck range (including taxes) as long as you aren't ordering carne asada or shrimp. But not at CJ's. Dinner menu boasts prices of $11.99+ and even appetizers prices are flagrantly high, especially considering the location of this place. Look, I'm not a cheapskate, nor do I think businesses should not make money, but the bottom line is I can go to numerous other Mexican restaurants and have just as good food for about 5 dollars less.\u000a\u000aFood - Chips were brought out cold. Bean dip was decent and warm. Salsa at least has a spice-kick to it, so it's not totally bland.\u000a\u000aOrdered - The "Casa don Juan" style wet burrito with chicken. The burrito is a decent size, comes with guac on top and the "wet" sauce. As for inside, you get beans, lettuce, meat, pico de gallo, rice, and lettuce. To me, the lettuce was gross, wet and mushy. The beans were eh same goes for the rice. The chicken was not seasoned very well - just plain 'ol shredded chicken. Overall the burrito was filling for my drunk tummy and that's all she wrote.\u000a\u000aSo. The deal is I would really love to at least LIKE Casa don Juan, but they just ain't cutting it. They need to make the food better and keep the prices, or they need to lower their menu prices and keep the same mediocre food. As with many places downtown I think Casa don Juan is going through growing pains and adapting to the new popularity that a decent downtown experience has to offer. I hope they find a happy medium, and I may try them again in the future. We shall see.

VI've had Sushi Mon on my radar for a long time, but since it is not anywhere near my house, nor is it around anywhere I tend to go all the time it has been collecting dust on my "Bookmark" shelf. Luckily lunch with a friend who works in the area happened to arise, so my reason to waste some gas to come here was justified at last!\u000a\u000aFirst off we arrived right when they opened at 11:45 AM and we were not the only ones waiting. About four other parties walked in the door at the same time as us. We were seated immediately at a two-person table and we let them know we would be doing the AYCE lunch special. \u000a\u000aI've heard really great things about Sushi Mon so I was hoping it would not disappoint. The restaurant itself is on the smallish side and decor is pretty much minimal and non-existent. Oh well, as long as the fish is good right? \u000a\u000aI skipped appetizers and went straight into the sushi. I figured I wouldn't fill myself up on anything but fish. Our server quickly took our order. \u000a\u000aNigiri:\u000aGarlic Tuna\u000aYum Yum Scallop\u000aSalmon \u000a\u000aAll were good, but my favorite was the Yum Yum Scallop. If I were to go back, this would be on the menu for a return trip.\u000a\u000aRolls:\u000a1/2 J.J. Roll - Lovely roll, really enjoyed the addition of asparagus and avocado.\u000aLemon Roll - My friend ordered this one and I had a piece, it was very fragrant and refreshing\u000aChubby (5 pieces) - Good roll, nothing spectacular, but well put together, the soybean paper around it is a nice change.\u000a\u000aHand-Rolls: Per usual I ordered a spicy tuna hand roll. I always do a sushi places. This one was tasty, so I actually had two. =o^-^o=\u000a\u000aOther:\u000aI did order the Poke bowl. It was okay, nothing special, but at least it was not overly-salted. I ended my meal with strawberry mochi ice cream - yummy! But so cold it hurt my teeth. But. That's just because I have sensitive teeth. Tee hee.\u000a\u000aOverall: \u000a\u000aI believe the "hype" is true. This place serves up GOOD, QUALITY sushi. And that is what matters when you are eating raw fish. Nothing tasted strange or wrong to me. The fish was the perfect temperature. The presentations were simple, but the rolls were made well. I would reccomened Sushi Mon and I would love to go back sometime if I am in the area.

VThis Vons is a very, very nice grocery store. I personally enjoy the set-up Vons has and the way they present their fruits and veggies. If you've ever noticed, Vons has a softer lighting to their store than most grocery stores. Alberton's is super bright. I haven't been to enough Smith's to compare.\u000a\u000aI like that Vons has a natural food selection and that they put all the natural one-serving size juices at the front of the store. \u000a\u000aThis particular Vons has a pretty awesome deli counter. You can get sandwiches made here. I had a simple turkey breast and provolone sandwich on wheat bread made for myself here. It was SO GOOD. The bread was fresh, the tomato and lettuce were nice and crisp. I have absolutely no complaints about this sandwich. I would probably eat this sandwich over one from a chain restaurant that specializes in sandwiches! \u000a\u000aThe customer service was great as well and I was rung up right at the deli counter.

VFor a few reasons I've been to this Best Buy which is quite a long ways a way from my house. Mostly I've been out here because I was doing other things/errands on this side of town and just decided to go in here to browse. I think my fiance also came here looking for something specific once, but I can't recall what it was.\u000a\u000aLike typical Best Buy's prices are higher than what you can find online or at other stores... usually. Whenever I come into a Best Buy I am pretty much there to look at stuff and comparison shop with prices I've seen elsewhere. IF I happen to find something that is lower than price, I'll probably buy it on the spot there.\u000a\u000aAs for the store itself, it's clean and expansive. I've never seen a whole lot of merchandise out of place and the employees seem to be around, but not in your face about stuff. Every once and awhile you'll probably get someone asking how you're doing/if they can help you.\u000a\u000aOverall, this is probably one of the better Best Buy's in the valley.

VForgettable.\u000a\u000aDon't get me wrong, this pizza place is good NY-style pizza. BUT my boyfriend and I both felt is was not the best we've had. My boyfriend is a pizza eating machine, but even a few hours later after leaving Verrazano he told me he didn't think it was that great. I'd have to agree.\u000a\u000aI like the shop, it's quaint and gives you a feeling like you're really eating in a hole-in-the-wall in New York City. The staff was friendly enough and our pizza came out pretty quick. There was only two other people in the place when we walked in. \u000a\u000aWe ordered a large with mushrooms and ham. Normally I would get pepperoni, but my boyfriend thinks it's too greasy *eye roll* Anyway, I had a LivingSocial deal for $20 and our total came to $18.something so we ended up not having to pay anything over, which I'm glad about.\u000a\u000aI felt as though the pizza did not have enough sauce and the cheese was kind of bland. Also, they were super skimpy on our toppings! I was really, really wanting some more mushrooms, but alas our pizza had only a few.\u000a\u000aI see that there are many good reviews for the white pizza, so if anything, I'd come back here to try that pizza. But being that it really isn't anywhere near where I live I probably will not get the chance.

VI drove aaaallll the way across town to come to this Pottery Barn to see if they had exterior outdoor lights I am looking for for my wedding. I saw them online at Pottery Barn, super cute little bug lights I plan to string around mine and my future husband's table where we'll be eating. And they have cafe globe lights, which I am planning to string all around the backyard space where the reception is.\u000a\u000aAnyway, these uber cute lights were not available at the store, only through online. However, the nice Pottery Barn employee there really went above and beyond to look and see if she could order them for me and if it would cost less than me buying them online. But we came to a decision that it would be best for me to ship them to myself because the website offers free shipping for those products anyway!\u000a\u000aWell at least I can say they have very nice stuff and a nice staff member!

VHere comes my review of Sedona Lounge. A place I'll probably never go to again unless I am invited to another birthday party or for some strange reason happen to be miles and miles away from my house.\u000a\u000aIt's only down-fall is how very far away it is from me. I really enjoyed Sedona Lounge, minus the long drive. But how can I fault a place for its location? I went here for a friend's birthday party and I had never been here before, although I had heard good things about it. I've also heard it is a place where "singles" in Vegas tend to go to hang out. I could see that. The place does have a vibe of trendy and young. The inside is nice and the bar is inviting. The cushy seats bar seats, as well the seats at the tables around the bar are very nice.\u000a\u000aI had two glasses of their French chardonnay. Normally, being that it was a bit pricey I would have only had one, but I decided to spring for another because it was good. Bad part about Sedona: service was kind of slow and the waitress appeared to be oblivious to the needs of 80% of our party. Yes, I realize working parties and it being a weekend night might have you skip a few people, but seriously, when you've walked by me twice and my drink is empty - you should ask me if I want another drink. So, my suggestion: get your drink order in with the waitress fast if you want it.\u000a\u000aI did end up having their tuna lettuce wraps and they were very good. Very fresh and with a bit of a spicy taste - but not too much! They were very nicely presented as well and the price was not bad, but only because they were good.\u000a\u000aOverall I really enjoyed Sedona. But it is just so very far away from me. If I lived in the neighborhood I would probably frequent it much more.

VThe BX is a decent place to shop in a pinch or if you just happen to be on base and there are things you gotta pick up here. I do not think prices at the BX always beat out prices at other stores though. You can do some good comparison pricing though and find deals that will save you time, money, and hassle other stores may present. Limited selections are often a problem.\u000a\u000aTheir makeup/fragrances/designer purse section is a God send for women like me. I can always find great makeup here that I would purchase at Sephora for the same prices, except here I am not paying tax. Also, the designer purses are great - lower prices, same thing.\u000a\u000aThe food court boasts some interesting choices: Taco Bell, the sandwich place, Baskin Robbins, etc. And there are always the kitchy shops that appear selling odd goodies, especially during Christmas. I have found some cool presents for certain people that are hard to shop for on ocassion.\u000a\u000aOverall, not the best, not the worst. Definitely deserving of a 4 star rating. Big plus - there is a Starbucks!

VPre-gaming before a concert, my friend and I decided to give Red Square a shot.\u000a\u000aI'm giving it a 4-star mainly for their happy hour. I think their happy hour pricing and the selection the offer for happy hour is really good for it being a restaurant in a casino on the strip. Their food menu actually has some good finds - salmon pizza, duck fat fries, meatballs, kobe beef sliders, etc. And the prices, again, for being on the strip are not bad. My friend and I shared the Duck Fat Fries with a side of aioli and tomato jam. Each dipping sauce added a little different taste to the fries. These fries are definitely an acquired taste and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone just desiring regular old french fries. Never the less I though they were tasty and the tomato jam was truly a different type of taste, one I've never really experienced before.\u000a\u000aDrink prices are also pretty decent. I had two glasses of pinot noir ($12). There are also well drinks and about four beers on the happy hour as well.\u000a\u000aMy friend also ordered a blackberry and peach pie off the dessert menu. It came out as a round little personal pie, not a slice with a scoop of ice cream and caramel. Um, the caramel came out in a little pot and was solidified. I honestly think they forgot to warm it up so it would pour before they brought out the plate. The pie itself was quite tasty, nice crust, and the fruit inside was not overly sweet.\u000a\u000aThe one thing here is service is a bit on the slow side, especially since it is packed during happy hour. My friend and I had to wave down the busser to get our check to our waitress who hadn't been back to our table to retrieve it. As we were trying to get to a concert this miffed us a bit. So just remember that when dining here. \u000a\u000aOverall I would come back here for happy hour and reccomend it to anyone seeking a happy hour that is a bit "different" on the strip.

VMyself, my mother, my sister, and my friend dined at Emeril's during Restaurant Week 2012. The delicious meals served here were amazing and presented very well. The service was fabulous and the waiters were well spoken, as well as generous (more on that later).\u000a\u000aThe four course RW meal had many choices. To begin with though we were brought a superb bottle of Riesling. I'm so sorry I missed what the name of it was! After our wine we were brought a bread plate that was full of tasty breads - most importantly, the pretzel bread! It was soft, warm, and had that salty pretzel taste.\u000a\u000aFor my meal I started off with the jalapeno cornbread heirloom tomato salad. It was incredibly filling. I would not suggest this for a starter when you are going to have more to eat! Although it was delicious, I was wishing for a bit more jalapeno kick.\u000a\u000aNext I had the Fall River Clam Chowder. All of our soups were poured simultaneously from the pots they were cooked in, into our bowls. I think the presentation adds a fun moment to the dining experience. As for the chowder, it was okay, but nothing amazing. I've had better chowder from a street vendor in San Francisco.\u000a\u000aFor the main course I opted for the Hoison glazed sea scallops and baby back ribs. I was slightly disappointed. When the first part of the meal says "Sea Scallops" I expected more of those and less of baby back ribs. But it was completely opposite. On the good side, the scallops were so good. Not chewy. They just melted in your mouth and they were BIG. I wish I had had more. I really only had a few bites of the ribs. I didn't think they were that great.\u000a\u000aLastly I had the banana cream pie. It is an absolute must. It was delightful. Somewhat fluffy, yet decadent at the same time. \u000a\u000aWe finished off two complimentary bottles of wine during the course of dining. Hmm, yes, well it helps to know people in the business. ;)\u000a\u000aOverall I can't give Emeril's 5 stars, but I am certainly a fan. I would love to return for more seafood on another visit.

VBleh. The Orleans was never a show-stopper. It was never one of those "great" casinos in Las Vegas. However, it has stayed alive. Probably because of its location, where there are no close casinos to compete with and its low prices. I'm sure locals are happy to gamble here as well, keeping the money flowing. Not to mention The Orleans stays alive with its large events stadium which hosts numerous events, including the Las Vegas hockey team.\u000a\u000aAs for the casino it is stinky like a rag of chew stuffed in the shirt of a non-stop chain smoker. Yes, obviously The Orleans has not updated its ventilation system and prefers its visitors to be enraptured in the smell of cigarettes.\u000a\u000aThe casino at least hosts a decent movie theater removed from the casino floor on a second level. As for the restaurants I cannot comment on them since I've never been in any of them. The only one I am slightly interested in going to is Fuddruckers, which I didn't even know they had until a most recent visit to see a movie.\u000a\u000aI also cannot comment on the rooms, but considering the grungy feel and nasty smell of the casino I would not bother staying here anyway. \u000a\u000aOrleans would be a lot better if they just got a better ventilation system, and they would probably need to tear out their carpet and put new carpet in. Of course, I rarely frequent the casino, so they need not do it just for me... haha.

VI am local Las Vegan and I have rarely gone inside the Paris. Perhaps I've popped in once or twice, but never have I stayed here and I have never heard much said about the place, save for the restaurants. I ended up coming here because I was having lunch with friends at Mon Ami Gabi.\u000a\u000aI'm giving two stars because just from walking around inside the casino it was pretty "meh".\u000a\u000aFirst off, the parking garage is horrible and is shared between Bally's and Paris. It's hard to get to, it's annoying to navigate, and it's placement is not helpful. Secondly I really dislike it when casino's parking garages push you out into a long hallway you have to walk down in order to get to the actual casino. Whoever decided it would be a great idea to put a long, cobble walkway between the garage and the casino floor... well, let's just say, not the brightest architectural genius out there. \u000a\u000aThe signage, although cute like little street signs, makes navigation throughout the casino hard. I found myself walking all the way up to the little signs and making circles around them in order to read where they were all pointing and what they were all pointing to. The sign for Mon Ami Gabi is non-existent until you get right in front of the restaurant and by that time you've found the place out of sheer luck anyway. \u000a\u000aThe casino itself is somewhat out-dated. I could definitely see room for improvement and renovation. I realize casinos on the strip age quickly, especially when newer ones burst onto the scene (IE: Cosmo, Aria, etc.), but that's just the way it goes. Paris should consider a new idea and get rid of the damn cobblestone flooring.

VThe Monte Carlo seems to be the step-child casino of the MGM Resorts. I have experienced the casino quite a few times and I have seen one of the rooms as well. So, I think I have a good idea of the casino and can truthfully review it in full capacity.\u000a\u000aAs for the casino itself - a solid 3 stars. Is it grand? No. Is it a crap-hole? No. It's an all right casino floor and it comes with a skanky party pit where half naked girls dance post 5 PM. \u000a\u000aDirectly off the casino floor is a food court - easy to find. The food court has a Rubio's, which is basically awesome (for me anyway) and the other typical fast-food places. There's also an area of shopping, and located in this area is The Pub, a place I have not tried, but have been tempted to. There are few restaurants. Honestly the only one I can say I have been in is the Italian place (can't recall the name). They put on a nice banquet at the event I caught the tail end of and the servers were polite and patient.\u000a\u000aThe rooms? Better than some strip properties I've seen, but definitely not ranking too high up there. It's a moderately decent room, with the basic amenities. I have not seen their suites, so I cannot comment.\u000a\u000aThe parking situation is all right. I have had no problem finding the garage, which is located behind the casino, but some might have some issues if they've never been to the Monte Carlo before. Best thing to do is to get a spot on the floor the has the walkway into the casino. This plops you right down into the hotel's front desk area.\u000a\u000aOverall the Monte Carlo is dancing a fine line between mediocrity and decent casino/hotel. Would I go out of my way to go here? No. But I wouldn't be against going here if I had a specific reason.

VI don't even care - I'm giving my beloved Double Down Saloon 5 Stars. I'm not even sure what kind of scale I'm rating this place on - divey? Drinks? Music venue? All of the above? \u000a\u000aThere are two types of people in Las Vegas - those who go to Double Down and go back, and those who go and then never go back. I believe at some point everyone in Vegas has been here. Hell, even my parents have been to this bar! But it's those who return that make it what it is.\u000a\u000aI've been here for lots of local shows and just to drink. Nope, I've never had the ass juice or the bacon martini. But I have had plenty of beer and Vodka Crans here (which might as well be reddish looking vodka in a glass). Yea, you get a heavy pour here, which is AWESOME. \u000a\u000aA lot of people say, "Oh this place is just for punks or heavily tattooed people". NO! I say to you all! It is not! Because if you can hang, than you can hang, and if you can deal with a supremely skanky bathroom and think nothing of it - than you shall be welcome here! Believe me, I used to go to DD all the time with a group of extremely well-kept Air Force boys. Yea, no tattoos in that crowd, but you know what? They were all there because they thought it was awesome.\u000a\u000aThat's what DD is about. It's about an attitude. You gotta love that about a bar in Sin City.

VFirst off the food was delicious, but secondly our service was phenomenal.\u000a\u000aMy friends and I dined at Mon Ami on a Tuesday morning (about 11 AM). We were seated in an area that was kind of outside, but also inside (because they had all the glass windows open to the outside dining area). I was quite pleased with out seating because it afforded us a view of the outside, but kept us from the literal "street-view" of the Strip. \u000a\u000aOur server was a congenial lovely woman who definetely has a knack for serving and making her guests feel at ease. Throughout the entire meal she refilled coffees, brought Diet Pepsis out without us having to ask, and truly made an effort to romanticize our lovely French dining experience.\u000a\u000aWe started our meal with the Escargot, which were swimming in a potent pesto and garlic sauce. The snails' texture was spot-on, not chewy, simply a good mouth-feel, and the garlic, while very prevalent, added to the escargot, it did not distract.\u000a\u000aMy Onion Soup was served with the appetizer and I was fairly happy with the soup. I thought though it had a bit too much of a sweet taste for my liking. The crouton and cheese ratio was a bit off, with there being a just a *tad* too much cheese. I almost felt bad leaving some of it in my cup, but I had really had enough of it as I got toward the end of the cup.\u000a\u000aAs for my main dish I stuck with a classic - Quiche Lorraine. The flavors were mixed well - not too much of any ingredient, and the crust was classic - flaky, but not too crunchy or over-baked. Perfect for a quiche. The quiche around the outside was a bit dry, but as you moved inward it became a much better mix of eggs and cheese. \u000a\u000aI ended with the Chocolate Mousse - a refreshingly light dessert, yet it is chocolate so it has that little bit of decadence you want with a dessert. It has little crunchy Kit-Kat like chocolate balls on top of it and is served with some amazing whipped cream on the side. I also sampled my friend's chocolate tart and believe me, that dessert is absolutely worth every penny. I sampled the Bananas Foster from my other friend's plate that too was absolutely delicious.\u000a\u000aOverall I must say Mon Ami had good food with just a few minor flaws, but the pristine service made up for it. 5 Stars indeed.

VI would say this was more of a 3.75 experience, but we must round up to 4 stars. \u000a\u000aMy friend and I dined at Andre's at 5:30 PM with a TravelZoo coupon for $99 which gets two people two pre-fixe three course meals with two cocktails. Yes, that is an amazing deal, so basically $50 per person (with gratuity included). Andre's gets two-thumbs up for the deal in the first place, and even more thumbs up for quickly providing the pre-fixe menu selections to us and delivering our complimentary cocktails amazingly quick as soon as we sat down.\u000a\u000aAndre's is a fascinating dining experience, with a quiet, dark, yet very refined dining room. The servers are quick to please and you can tell they enjoy the food, explaining it, presenting it, and even, in a flourish, taking it off your table when you are done. I absolutely adore the gold dome covers for some of the dishes that come out. I also truly admire their plating and the colors of the plates/style which reminded my friend and I of Tiffany's.  \u000a\u000aAppetizer - Foie Gras with fig/apple reduction. A medley of savory and sweet, cooked perfectly, with a slight, crisp exterior, and a melt-in-your-mouth, buttery interior. Presentation could use some refinement, but overall pleased with the dish. (BTW - this was not on the Pre-Fixe Menu)\u000a\u000aPre-Fixe Starter: French Onion Soup - Ee gads, the soup was inedible. I tried to eat some, but could not. The top was charred too much. It must have sat under the broiler to melt the cheese for too long. One of my croutons simply looked like a black coal, I kid you not. \u000a\u000aEntree - Rib eye, with potato cake and broccolini. I have never been a fan of broccolini. I would much rather have plain old broccoli, mostly because it's just easier to eat. However, it was well cooked and had a bite to it, so at least it was not flaccid and inedible. The potato cake tasted like hash browns, but in a square cake form. The rib eye was tender, ordered medium, and honestly very good. Although I recently had a more expensive rib eye that has kind of ruined a lot of meat for my in general. None the less this one was the best part of my entree.\u000a\u000aDessert - Creme brulee with seasonal fruit. Presentation was perfect, but the bowl was too shallow! Ahem, I mean, I can always use more creme brulee! Although the portion was small, it was still a creamy creme brulee, with only the slightest crackle to the top, which I prefer over a harder char on my dessert.\u000a\u000aOverall Andre's is kind of a diamond in the rough of Monte Carlo. It should definitely be on any fine-dining "must do" list though. I would certainly return, especially since they appear to feature seasonal tasting menus and happy hours.

VMandalay Bay is one of the few casinos on the strip I don't mind going into. I think it might be because it is on the far south end of the strip. I'm guessing sometimes tourists don't bother to go down this far. They stop at Luxor and return back up to the strip for more skeezy Vegas fun. Also, Mandalay isn't terribly intriguing to people who do not know what is inside it. There's no theme, no over-abundance of glamor, but it's a GREAT casino AND hotel.\u000a\u000aRooms - From the one time I stayed in a hotel room here I thought it was great. The bed was a piece of heaven - I slept all the way through the night! It's everything you'd expect from a nice hotel room with a bit more class than what you'll find at say, Luxor. But it's probably not as nice as Wynn or Bellagio.\u000a\u000aShopping - Mandalay Place has a few shops of interest to me. Most importantly: Urban Outfitters. A reason to go in and of itself.\u000a\u000aShows/Concerts - I have only seen The Lion King here, but that is enough for me to give it 5-Stars based off of just this one show. I LOVE Lion King and this show is stellar. Another plus: Mandalay has the House of Blues, a great place to see live bands and even comedians. They host a wide range of shows with a wide range of prices. Also, they now offer discounts for drinks at certain shows for locals, as well as no service fees if you buy your ticket at the box office with a local ID.\u000a\u000aBars & Drinking - This is the reason MB does not get 5-stars. I got a BIG surprise for ordering a Red Bull & Vodka at the Sports Book - a $14 check! FOR ONE DRINK! I get it, MB, you're a hotel on the strip - but COME ON! Especially at the Sports Book?!\u000a\u000aFood - I can't comment as I have not eaten anywhere, but I have typically seen good reviews. I am also intrigued by the Russian restaurant and will be going to dinner there soon. So hopefully I'll have a review of that place soon!\u000a\u000aOverall - Mandalay is doing everything right. I think other casinos should follow suit!

VAllow me to add my review to the numerous reviews of Bouchon already here. After all, I've lived in Las Vegas nearly my whole life and today was my first trip. Being that my heritage is 50% French I feel as though I've been doing myself a disservice of *not* visiting Bouchon. Now that I have been, I will admit, I most certainly want to go back.\u000a\u000aAlthough I was disappointed I am unable to attend their brunch which is served on the weekends only, my friend and I made late breakfast plans at Bouchon on a Tuesday. When we arrived we were told there would be a 10-15 minute wait. I believe our wait was only about 5 minutes. \u000a\u000aWe were brought into the dining area which has a large, cavernous feel to it because the ceilings are very high and it is a rather open restaurant. Plus there is plenty of daylight that comes in through the large, glass windows. Overall I enjoyed the feel of the restaurant. The only thing I could comment on negatively was the fact that there was a fine settling of dust on top of the velvet bench cushion I was seated on. However, I'll forgive it, since this is the desert after all.\u000a\u000aOur server arrived and offered water, which we both partook of. I informed the server we would be starting with the foie gras (2.5 oz/$25). It was served up by a gentleman who mumble-bumbled something to us as he scooped the foie gras out and presented our bread. Now, this was my first time eating foie gras so I really have nothing to compare it to, but I thought it was deliciously decadent and had a certain taste of fat/butter. My friend and I really enjoyed it and noted it got better with each bit of it you happened to eat. We didn't even finish the 2.5 oz container between the two of us.\u000a\u000aOur Croque Madames came out and I was pleasantly surprised to see it was quite a large portion of food. After all, paying upwards of almost $20 for a ham and cheese sandwich - I was hoping it would be fulfilling! The best part for me was the amazingly rich white sauce that accompanied the sandwich. It was just fantastic and everything one could hope for in a fulfilling French sauce. After all, sauces are a staple of French cuisine/cooking. \u000a\u000aAs we ate and ate we became fuller and fuller. I left about half of my french fries (which were also very good!) on my plate. I went through about 3 cups of Bouchon's velvety delicious coffee. And lucky for us - our server asked if we would like cups of coffee to go! Hurray! We paid our bill as we awaited our to-go cups.\u000a\u000aOverall for food - absolute 5 stars.\u000aOverall for service - 5 stars.\u000aAmbiance/Restaurant - 4 stars. \u000a\u000aOverall rating completely has to be 5 Stars. I cannot wait for my next visit to Bouchon!

VI'll be honest - I was not expecting much from Olives. I realize its allure of being next to the Bellagio fountains puts it quite high on people's lists, but for some reason I was thinking, "Maybe that's the ONLY reason people come here." I had doubts about quality of food, service, etc. I was proven wrong.\u000a\u000a** Review is for LVRW2013 Menu **\u000a\u000aMy friend and I made a reservation for Olives at 11:30 AM on Wednesday during Restaurant Week. When we arrived the restaurant was just about empty with only a few patrons. It helps to get there before the true lunch rush, as you can spend a majority of your dining time without other tables seated around you.\u000a\u000aThe interior of Olives is pleasing, classy, nothing over the top. The chairs and tables are clean, minimalist, and yet, classic. I cannot say anything about the outside by the fountains, because being that it has been muggy and humid in Vegas my friend and I chose to dine inside.\u000a\u000aOur server was immaculate, courteous, and I could tell he enjoyed working there. He was also extremely willing to go out of his way for us (more on that later).\u000a\u000aLet's get into the meat of the matter, the food.\u000a\u000aFoie Gras - The foie gras is not on the lunch menu as my friend and I came to find out as we looked for it to no avail. We inquired, and our server, seeing as we were quite interested in having the plate, very kindly asked the chef if it would be possible for us to have a plate of the foie gras. Lucky for us, the chef was willing to oblige, which I must say I am very thankful for because the presentation and tastes of this foie gras was superior to many I have had in the past. Ours was prepared just perfectly seared, with a jam/compote of peaches and a bit of apples underneath. It was magnificent, and slightly different from the dinner option. \u000a\u000aLVRW Starters\u000a\u000aI had the Caprese Tart (flatbread) for my starter, and it is BIG. Much bigger than I was expecting. It is presented on what looks to be a wooden cutting board (or more likely what they take it out of the oven with). This particular menu item I believe is only on the RW2013 menu as I searched the website and it was not on their online menu. Never the less it was crispy perfect, the cheese and tomatoes were melded together and it was not overly indulgent. \u000a\u000aMy main meal was the Grilled Skirt Steak (medium well), although I thought the meat was more on the medium side. The grilling process they use here made the meat have quite a crispy exterior and a barely-cooked inside. It wasn't bloody, but it was on the verge. Fortunately I like my meat either way and rarely send back steak unless it is moo'ing at me. Meat was somewhat tough, but still good. I just was not a fan of the charred taste on the outside. It came with an extremely hearty sausage mashed potatoes (delicious! but almost too much!), and probably THE BEST brussel sprouts I have ever eaten! Just absolutely mouth watering. Who says that about brussel sprouts?\u000a\u000aLast, a trio of fresh sorbets to end my meal. Dainty, yet fruity, with frozen strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries. A perfect end to my meal. \u000a\u000aOverall I would absolutely go back to Olives. The food and service exceeded my expectations greatly. Much respect to this restaurant, they are living up to their name and their prices.

VI am deducting a star from my previous review.\u000a\u000aSet scene: Saturday night, my friend's birthday dinner, Olives is busy, noisy, and full of patrons. Our six-person party is seated in the main dining area and our menus are give to us, as well as the iPad wine menu (so fancy huh). I swept through the wine menu, but wasn't sure on what to have. I inquired with our waiter who seemed not so keen to help me decide so I had to goad him with a few clues and actually ended up taking the advice of my friend seated next to me while the waiter just nodded and took the order.\u000a\u000aNext came dinner; although the food was very good I feel as though the prices are somewhat askew. Not on everything, but definitely on the Grilled Sirloin my husband ordered for $49. The steak was minuscule, and yes, I realize plating and stacking food is a cute and fancy and all, but I don't care how you stacked this thing it was still not big enough to justify being $49. I must admit though that my husband missed out on half the dish as he requested the peas, onions, and roquefort cream be removed from the dish. (Yes, this is me sighing unpleasantly as he explains this to the server. Ah, my picky husband...)\u000a\u000aI had the Ricotta Ravioli, actually a very decadent dish with the perfect amount of raviolis and sweet Italian sausage. It was the perfect amount of food, and the price was solid.\u000a\u000aFoie gras... our table split this as an app. This time around I felt as though the foie gras was not as good. It was a bit stringy, and honest to goodness I was a bit miffed at the lighting in the dining room because I couldn't SEE the appetizer as it was on the other side of the table from me. \u000a\u000aFor dessert... my husband and I shared the Pumpkin-pie-like-custard-like dessert creation. The name escapes me now, but dang it was PUMPKINY. I had a bite and was basically floored by how much it tasted like pumpkin. \u000a\u000aOverall... I plan to head elsewhere for birthday or anniversary or night-out dining in Vegas. Although I do like Olives I think there are some places that do the special night out dining better.

VI must say I do enjoy the LV Premium Outlets. \u000a\u000aAlthough it is outdoors, I might still find myself heading here in the middle of the summer just based off the fact they have stores I 1. enjoy and 2. actually have decent prices.\u000a\u000aParking can be a hassle, but there are two garages, so pick your poison between garages. Be forewarned: it is outdoors, so summer months could have you sweating between stores. \u000a\u000aA lot of tourists. TONS of tourists. It is not a "local" place by any means.\u000a\u000aStill, gotta love cheap shopping. The structural layout is actually pretty decent and the signage is helpful. There's an eatery and a Starbucks that is always busy. \u000a\u000aI think overall this a good premium outlet.

VSo I've been meaning to try Tiffany's for a long time. I really was never sure where it was, although I knew from reading other reviews that it was inside the White Cross Drugs. Well, I was a bit apprehensive as I walked in the door, but there it was in all its glory - the greasy spoon diner that is Tiffany's!! Oh how I wish I had come here sooner, because in Las Vegas... how often is it you can walk into a TRUE greasy spoon diner? \u000a\u000aI ordered to go, and the waitress was more than happy to get me my food going real quick. It wasn't busy though, and I saw the chefs hop right on my order. I got the Tiffany burger - cheese, bacon, grilled onions, mushrooms, tomato, and lettuce. For the boyfriend I got the Mushroom burger. Both burgers came with yummy thick-cut fries. \u000a\u000aLuckily my house isn't TOO far from Tiffany's so when I got the burgers and fries home they were still pretty much like they just came off the line. Let me tell you - the burgers are MASSIVE! Neither my boyfriend or I could finish ours and we both had them the next day for lunch.\u000a\u000aThe only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the cash only policy. I know, it's a diner, I should have been aware AND there is a sign posted on the wall - but these days it's just so weird to come across a place that won't take a card. I never, ever carry cash and had to go use the ATM inside White Cross Drugs. I also felt like a dummy for not having cash after the waitress brought me my food, but oh well. \u000a\u000aWill I be back? Yes, I hope so! I'd definitely like to check out their breakfast items!

VI may have given another star had it not been for the place being so crammed together. I think they could use to lose a few tables and open up the dining area, also PLEASE pull your tables away from the area where people are walking to get to the buffet. I've never been seated so closely to the actual food. My table was basically IN the dessert section.\u000a\u000aAs for the food - there's a lot of selection and numerous "stations" with different ethnic foods to choose from.\u000a\u000aI sampled mainly from the seafood; got crab legs, peel n eat shrimp, some buffalo popcorn shrimp (yum!), some sushi (dry, yuck). Tried some food from the Mediterranean section. Hummus, dates, lamb, naan bread, olives, etc. Okay, but not great, I've had better Greek food elsewhere.\u000a\u000aMexican, American, and meat carving areas did not interest me, although my Father-In-Law got a nice looking piece of prime rib. My husband also got some fried chicken that he said was quite tasty.\u000a\u000aDesserts - Mainly their dessert section is cupcakes, although I did manage to find some pretty decent cannolis. The cupcake I had was OK, but kind of dry. I honestly don't even remember which kind it was now, but if you have a thing for cupcakes you will love this place.\u000a\u000aOverall - not bad. Of course, my Father-In-Law paid the bill so I can't complain. But would I throw down money here myself? Probably not. I'd go to another buffet around town. \u000a.

VVENUE REVIEW - not the restaurant \u000a\u000aHere's the dealio with HOB: For a long time they genuinely were a venue that did absolutely nothing to cater to locals. They jacked up prices and made concert goers pay outrageous random fees. Which, by the way, you will STILL have to pay if you purchase any tickets for this venue on Ticketmaster. A ticket that starts at a base of $25 will end up costing you $37 by the time you finally purchase (no joke here).\u000a\u000aSo, as a local, I do have the ability to purchase tickets directly at the box office and if YOU are a local, I suggest you do the same. I recently went to see Jimmy Eat World here and purchased my ticket on site. SHOW THEM YOUR LOCAL ID before they punch in the purchase! They will waive the fees AND you will receive a pass that gets you a percentage off of drinks in the venue on the night of the show. YAY! \u000a\u000aThe night I went to see JEW, it was an all ages crowd, which is always a little annoying, but I digress. I do think HOB is a nice venue and it is versatile. I have seen many shows here: Ghostland Observatory, Less Thank Jake, Reel Big Fish, and also, Adam Carolla doing stand up. \u000a\u000aThe JEW show I think was over-sold. There was just WAY too many people crammed in the venue. HOB has a special vibe, it has a good bar staff and an intimate feel - and you should not have to be crammed up against someone like you're at freaking Warped Tour when you go there.\u000a\u000aI really think they should streamline their process of getting in as well. Do I REALLY need to be asked 3 times to show my ticket? Especially when I already get in the venue and have two paper bracelets on my arm? Digging my ticket out of my purse once I've walked down the stairs is just a hassle, and is unnecessary.\u000a\u000aAnyway, every concert venue in Vegas over-prices their tickets in my opinion. They know they can get away with it because so many people from out of town come to see shows here, but at least HOB is now offering the locals discount.

VI couldn't believe a place like this in Las Vegas actually existed. Being that I hate the culture of Las Vegas (clubs, etc) I just never really thought there would be something this interesting to do and I have grown up here.\u000a\u000aI love this place, my friend and I went on a double date with our boyfriends here one week night and we ended up having a really fun time. I thought it would be a great way to spend a night and it certainly was. All the games are operated by actual coins (quarters, nickels, dimes, etc). And they have everything from really old pinball games to really new ones. Also, there are a few classic arcade games that are awesome to play. LOVE this place and if you're looking for something totally different to do in Vegas - than this is it.

VWho wants expensive desserts and drinks?! Well, you ARE in the Aria, come on now people, bring money bags along and get some yummies!\u000a\u000aI'm being a little silly here, of course, but don't come here without expecting to shell out some money. Jean Philippe is an open-area type coffee/dessert place off of Aria's main casino floor. The intricate sculptures of the "walls" and mod furniture styling is fantastic. \u000a\u000aThe desserts are delicious. Period. I shared with a friend the "Intense" flourless chocolate cake and the Strawberry/Lemon Cupcake. Both were delightful. I also indulged in a coffee, which went perfectly with my desserts. \u000a\u000aOverall - completely pleased with my experience here and I will come back.

VI have heard the rumors of a delicious burger. I have heard this delicious burger can be found at Bradley Ogden. \u000a\u000aMy friends and I bid farewell to Bradley Ogden, which is closing on August 5th. Although I have meant to come here numerous times I've never made it. I figured I better do it now, before I can't anymore.\u000a\u000aWe showed up around 6 PM on a Saturday evening and were greeted by a nice, yet not in particularly attentive hostess. She ended up seating us at the bar, but in a portion of the bar that was to be used for a private party. We were unceremoniously swept to another area of the crowded bar and hastily shoved in a corner by the hostess and another, rather brusque woman. \u000a\u000aSo it didn't start off well. At least the bar service made it all better. Our bartender was impeccable, kept an eye on our drinks, and fulfilled our needs with ease. I had the Riesling ($12), two glasses, a 2010 from Willamette Valley. Honestly it was one of the best Rieslings I've had. It even outshines many German Rieslings I tend to stick with.\u000a\u000aMoving on to the Pre-Fixe Lounge menu. Of course I ordered the Hamburger, cheddar cheese, the Bradley Ogden Ceaser Salad for starters, and ended with the butterscotch pudding accompanied with two snickerdoodle cookies.\u000a\u000aThe burger really was delectable (ordered Medium, and usually I go with medium well) and had that fresh farm taste that very good meats tend to have. If you can taste the fact the cow is eating well, that is good meat. The burger came accompanied with fries, a mayo, a spicy mustard, and a ketchup. The mayo was heaven, I even dipped my fries in it (FATTY ALERT). \u000a\u000aBUT - I think I may have enjoyed the Ceaser Salad even more. It was crisp, perfectly seasoned, the croutons were crunchy and perfect. I mean, I don't understand how a salad can really be that good, but honestly, it was! \u000a\u000aLastly, the dessert was light, not super decadent. It is a nice end to the meal, especially after having eaten the heavy burger. The snickerdoodles were soft and complimented the butterscotch pudding.\u000a\u000aOverall I must admit I wish I could go back and try something else. But I can't. How sad.

VIf you're in the mood for overly-salted "Italian" food crafted specifically for the purpose of an American tourist palate and appetite, then please, come to Maggiano's Little Italy. It's helpfully located in the Fashion Show Mall as to beckon the tourists who cannot afford or do not know what *real* (and when I say real, I mean decent) Italian food is. \u000a\u000aI ventured here with a $25 gift card for lunch. My intent was to have the following: a tasty adult beverage, a soup, and a main dish. Being that one of my favorite Italian dishes (Linguine Clams) was on the menu I knew I would order it. \u000a\u000aFirst off I arrived a la solo, which I don't think should be weird, especially for lunch these days. Of course, the hostess attempted to seat me at the bar, to which I declined politely and was lead to a table in the dining area. Impressions: at least it is well-lit during the daytime hours with plenty of windows for viewing the surrounding strip attractions. However, table cloths were rumpled, salt and pepper shakers had a waxy build-up on them. This comes from a restaurant wiping them down with nothing but a damp towel. I should know, I was a server in college. \u000a\u000aStarters - I ordered a Peach Bellini and my server brought bread. Sad, pitiful (but at least warm) bread. He did not pour my EVOO (which is on the table), nor did he offer me any balsamic. Yet, as I watched around me, servers plated EVOO and balsamic for THEIR tables. The Peach Bellini arrived in a martini glass. I was disappointed in that, and then even further disappointed that my peach Bellini was not garnished at all and it had no actual fruit in it. It was overly sweet, and not worth $9.  \u000a\u000aSoup ($3) - I ordered the Creamy Chicken Potato soup. It was salt. Salt. Salt. Salt. The vegetables were obviously of the frozen variety, and the presentation was horrific. The soup had spilled over the side of the cup and they hadn't bothered to at least wipe it. \u000a\u000aLinguine Clams with Red Sauce ($15.95) - This dish should be called Linguine with clams because there was barely a trace of sauce in my bowl/plate. There were so many noodles I thought the waiter had served me a portion for three people. I get it, this is a "family style" place, but for lunch portions also? Also: SALT, SALT, SALT. The dishes here are obviously doctored to an "Americanized" "Iodized" diet. Hefty in portions and in salt. I could barely stomach my noddles and although the clams were decent, there was no "seafood/brine" taste to this dish that SHOULD be there. Comparing this Linguine Clams to others I have eaten (mainly at Chicago Joes downtown), well I just cannot even compare the two. \u000a\u000aThey do not make lunch portions. The lunch is just a shortened menu of their dinner. You get ginormous dinner portions and you pay the same amount of money. it's honestly a tourist-trap rip-off.\u000a\u000aI am sure the better ratings of this place are coming from tourists. But being a local I can only offer this advice: there are much better Italian places in town. Find them and stay away from Maggianos.\u000a\u000aThank goodness I had a gift card.

VAgain, not impressed, although my dinner experience was a thousand times better than my solo lunch experience. I am not willing though to rate to a higher level as this dinner on many levels fell flat. I should have known, but kept my hopes up none the less. My husband and I were invited to a date night dinner here, so we went along for the ride.\u000a\u000aFirst off, service was a tad better this time around. Our waiter was a bit of an odd-ball though. I have to give him props for getting me a cocktail in just in time for the Happy Hour price. He was also incredibly knowledgeable about the restaurant's extensive menu. Happily telling us all kinds of things, including his opinion of the Marsala sauce that is very unlike his Italian grandmothers.\u000a\u000aAppetizers:\u000a\u000aCalamari Fritte, served with marinara. It was fried Calamari. Luckily though it was not soggy or gross. It was fried up nicely and with a spritz of lemon and a bit of the sauce was a decent app. \u000a\u000aSpinach & Artichoke Al Forno - I am a fan of artichokes in apps. My favorite though it basically just grilling the artichoke and serving it to me as is. However, I was not impressed with this dip. It is baked in an Asiago and Alfedo-like cheese sauce and it just did not have any zing to make it any better than any other spinach dip I have had.\u000a\u000aCrab & Shrimp Cannelloni ($18.50) - Ugh! What a waste of money. This dish came out in a POOL of cheese sauce. Literally, the entire plate was cheese sauce. The menu description says this, "Asiago cheese sauce and breadcrumbs". No. There were no breadcrumbs. My plate was a goopy pile of cheese sauce, with three lone Cannellonis that had, perhaps, 4-5 pieces of shrimp. The peppers included did not enhance the meal one bit. The cannelloni was soggy and unappetizing and the crab meat inside was like a wet mop, just smooshy and gross. I was incredibly disappointed in this dish.\u000a\u000aI wish I had gotten the Spaghetti and Meat Sauce, which is what my husband got, and he cleaned his plate!\u000a\u000aCreme Brulee ($7.95) - A huge portion of creme brulee served in a trough. Okay, I'm just kidding it wasn't served in a trough, but it might as well have been. The dessert portions are large, so ya know, share. My husband had one spoonful of the creme brulee and I was left to eat the rest of it.\u000a\u000aAgain, as an overall opinion - it's over-priced, over-salted, overly-hyped Italian food on The Strip. It's a chain Italian restaurant I will continue to avoid.

VI stopped in at this IHOP with a bunch of co-workers at a very, very busy morning hour. There were about 10 of us. They accommodated us very quickly though, even with the high capacity of customers they had at the time.\u000a\u000aOur waitress split our checks without hesitation, we didn't even have to ask. Although we did mention it, and she replied it would be no problem, and she was already doing it anyway. She kept our drinks full, the food came out in a perfect amount of time as well. \u000a\u000aI was really surprised with how well everything went to be honest. Since we were such a large group and because it was busy. They are probably used to this though, because they are on Las Vegas Boulevard. I do believe their prices are jacked up a bit because of their location. Others in my group agreed to this as well. I guess we're all IHOP connoisseurs...\u000a\u000aIf I happened to be in the area and wanted breakfast I'd definitely go back. Word of caution though - I think the reason we all received such quick service is because it was terribly obvious we were there for lunch during our lunch break and we all had federal government ID's. So will this happen to every large group that comes through here on a busy morning? I wouldn't guarantee it.

VIf anyone knows me, or has read many of my reviews they know I shy away from the strip. And by shy away from I mean completely avoid at all costs for the most part. Why? Because I'm a local and I've lived here all my life. I've seen casinos come and casinos go and I am under no illusion that 30 years from now the Wynn and Encore will be imploded and something new will be in their place. However, for right now I will review one of the most fabulous bar/lounges on the strip.\u000a\u000aParasol Down can be easily overlooked if you're not looking for it. It is in The Wynn and can be located by looking for... well, the big hanging parasols and large glass windows that go out to the waterfall outside. I used to patronize Parasol when I worked as a promoter at Blush Boutique Nightclub in Wynn. It was a nightly ritual for me to go with one of my coworkers and enjoy a glass of wine. \u000a\u000aParasol is known for great drinks and great service. The bartenders are also very knowledgeable and eager to please. I would certainly hope so though - they are working in the fabulous Wynn.\u000a\u000aThere is a water show which I have never seen. When I worked at Wynn it was winter and I was not willing to go outside in a mini-dress to watch a water show. But I have heard good things about it.\u000a\u000aParasol is CLASSY. Which I just can't bring myself to say about many destinations in Las Vegas, even if they are super expensive. But Parasol is classy in ambiance and service and it really must be experienced in person to understand.

VThis review is actually for FRIGHTDOME, which happens in the month of October to celebrate Halloween. Just to be noted - the main attraction rides (roller coaster and splash ride) are still open during Frightdome. \u000a\u000aWhat a waste of money, and my friend and I even had a coupon for $10 off. We each paid $27 to get into Frightdome. It consists of numerous "haunted houses/mazes" with differing themes. I would name off the the themes, but to me each maze was pretty much the same thing. When I go to a mental ward haunted maze and see guys bumbling around in suit jackets - that's wrong. That does not go with the theme of a mental ward.\u000a\u000aThe dome is darkened and every once and awhile while walking you may encounter some creep coming up to you and breathing heavily in your ear or perhaps you can be "scared" by the guy with the chainsaw over and over again during your visit. It gets old fast is what I'm saying.\u000a\u000aCustomer service was sub-par at best. The staffing here is sullen teenagers who would rather text than give good customer service. My friend and I (plus about 6 other people) walked up to a maze with no one in line. Instead of just lifting the rope the girl working the maze made us walk all the way around the queue to get in. Also of mention is the crabby girls who took my money and gave my friend and I snotty remarks regarding our coupons.\u000a\u000aNever again will I return to Frightdome.

VI attended the Backstreet Boys concert at Mandalay Bay Events Center. I have never been to an event/concert at this venue and was not sure what to expect. However, I did expect more than what I got.\u000a\u000aThe events center itself is not laid out how you would expect when looking at ticketing assignments on the Internet. My friend and I thought we would have seats on the end of a row, but ended up being closed off in a tight space next to a concrete wall/prison-esque wire. \u000a\u000aThe show was wrought with problems. When I pay money for a concert, especially at a place like Mandalay Bay I expect the show to be pretty much flawless. The Backstreet Boys brought their A game, the people running the concert did NOT. The two "large" (not really even that big) screens continually kept going off. Off and on, off and on. Sometimes there was even a blue screen saver. And other times there was some drop down menu up in the right hand corner of the screens. If I were running the technical camera aspects of this show I would be ashamed. And if I were the manager of the people running this show I would seriously reconsider their employment.\u000a\u000aFor Mandalay Bay bringing in a lot of big acts, and for it supposedly being such a top-notch venue I felt as though I was gyped out of the money I paid.

VI adore Zia Records. Everything from their CD collection to DVDs, to the locals music section (in the back by the way!), to their wall 'o kitschy products that no one really needs, but you just absolutely want. I also adore their coffee mugs - sci fi, nerdy, and music genres all included! \u000a\u000aThey host acoustic band nights and movie screenings as well. Often artists come here to do signings.\u000a\u000aMostly though it is just a relief to be able to go somewhere and browse music CDs, possibly find a new favorite band, or re-live an old favorite. \u000a\u000aI've never really been asked if I needed help finding anything by any of the employees, but I kind of like that vibe when I'm searching for music here. If I'm not directed to exactly what I might be looking for I tend to find other CDs I might not have even considered.\u000a\u000aOverall Zia Records is great. Oh, did I mention they have vinyl? Yep, thay got that going for them too.

VI have heard about these trampoline places all over Vegas for awhile now, but I never had the deep desire to go myself. This all changed last weekend when I ended up randomly attending a birthday party here. It was one of those "friend of a friend" situations.\u000a\u000aFirst off the place is open late which makes it a stand-out place for teenagers to go have some decent fun (and keep them out of things they should not be doing). When I was here our group was literally the oldest bunch of people bouncing around, becoming exhausted and then watching the teenagers with their boundless energy bounce around us.\u000a\u000aIt's a decent facility... think skating rink meets warehouse. But the whole point is to go bounce on trampolines. The staff was friendly enough, but definitely 90% teenagers. I do not think I saw one adult in the place who was working there, which kind of worries me.\u000a\u000aThe trampolines themselves appeared clean and well taken care of. My friends and I had a really good time. It's like being 14 again!\u000a\u000aOnly complaints... some of their shoes you have to wear could use some up-keep. On mine the shoe laces were falling apart and I realized halfway into my bouncing that one of them had a velcro strap and the other did not. AND when my friend and I were leaving we saw a nasty cockroach scurry across the floor. I know it's Vegas and this place probably has these little buggers everywhere, but just seeing one gave me the heeby jeebies. Perhaps they should do a little bug spraying.

VThe plan - Pre Fixe lunch at a restaurant at the Cosmopolitan. Circumstances went awry. New plan - Pre Fixe lunch menu at Social House.\u000a\u000aThis is a contemporary, strangely adorned restaurant located in Crystals. The restaurant itself was basically empty when my friend and I entered and were greeted by the hostess. We were sat in the dining room which espouses some kind of odd bordello/bird nest vibe. I say bird nest, because the enormous lighting fixtures above the dining room resembled bird nests made of hair. Take that as you will.\u000a\u000aOur waiter (Daniel) arrived and took our drink order. Ice water was ordered and we were delivered room temperature water. Daniel scurried around the restaurant taking care of other tables and disappearing while my friend and I decided upon our Pre Fixe meals. Many minutes later Daniel returned to take our order. \u000a\u000aDaniel insisted the Locomoco was "just hamburger on rice with gravy". No really, "it's just hamburger"; that is after we asked what the entree was and how it tasted. Nice sell, Daniel. Oh and he did beseechingly tell us, "It's a Hawaiian dish". Mm hmm. \u000a\u000aOrdered -\u000a\u000aGreen Tea ($7). Obviously this green tea must have been produced from rainbows from a panda's ass, because never in my life will I ever pay for Green Tea that is $7 ever again. Note to self - ask for drink prices. *face palm*\u000a\u000aMiso Soup - decent, perhaps a bit too salty. Very few cubes of tofu and even less green onions.\u000a\u000aChicken Teriykai Donburi - Chicken was dry as a bone. As sad as it is to say I felt as though *I* cooked the chicken in this dish because I ALWAYS overcook chicken. The pickled veggies in the dish were lost on me because I don't eat pickled anything.\u000a\u000aSalmon Roll - Decent. My favorite part of the whole meal. Wish I'd just gotten sushi for the whole meal. Although the rolls were on the minuscule side (no wonder, this place is in Crystals on the Strip). \u000a\u000aFood - Mediocre at best, perhaps dinner is better?\u000aDecor - Bordello Bird Nest\u000aService - Hope Daniel enjoyed his tip as much as he enjoyed being our server, as in, not much.

VI have been holding on to a Triple George Grill $25 gift card for over a year. Yes, over a year and I finally made it here to use my card. My friend and I arrived right after the lunch rush, about 1 PM on Thursday afternoon. There were lots of suits and what looked to be business lunch meetings going on. Obviously this is the place to be for lunch if you work downtown!\u000a\u000aMy friend and I were seated at a two person table, but I noted there are nice secluded booths which were all full. I liked the wooden, dark atmosphere. It was quite loud when we entered, but as people began to filter out the noise level went down quite a bit.\u000a\u000aOur server was a very nice, funny older gentleman who seemed to be quite busy, but he did get to us eventually. I think the wait might have been a bit more irritating had my friend and I not gone to do a lot of chatting and catching up. They did serve us nice warm bread, with room temp butter (easy to spread). I opted for an iced tea and my friend, a water, which were kept full by our waiter and the busser.\u000a\u000aI ordered the NY Steak Sandwich with fries ($14.95), my friend got the Grilled Chicken Sandwich ($9.95 and part of their "10 under 10" Menu). My sandwich was ordered medium well, but looked more medium to me when I got it. However, I did not send it back because I do enjoy medium steak as well (I rarely freak out if my meat isn't perfect). The very thinly sliced red onion was a perfect compliment to this sandwich. The fries were hot and thin and somewhat crispy. I enjoyed them.\u000a\u000aMy friend and I ended up chatting for awhile after what was left of our meals were boxed up and our drinks were continually refilled. By the time we left the place was pretty much dead as the lunch rush was over. Overall I found the food and atmosphere to be quite pleasing. I would definitely make a return visit.

VTriple George Grill again receives a 4-star rating. Although not a knock-out the place is a diamond in the rough of downtown Vegas. I treated my husband to a birthday dinner here late on Monday night. We showed up at about 9:20 PM, and it closes at 10 PM, luckily we were not the only patrons still in the establishment as our dining experience went past their closing time.\u000a\u000aOur server was a very happy woman who knew her menu very well. Overall the service was 5-stars. Not a problem.\u000a\u000aI started off with a White Blend from Napa Valley, CA called Rhapsody, my husband ordered water. The White Blend was... hum, how can I put it? Very close to being atrocious? Of course, this is not the restaurant's fault, it's my fault for having a picky wine palate. Their wine menu features primarily California wines, with a few Italian varietals. No French wine. *clown tear*\u000a\u000aMoving on, I ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna Steak ($23.95), raw, with a side of wild rice, green beans/carrots, and soy sauce/wasabi. The tuna was pretty much perfect. The wild rice was pretty meh. Green beans and carrots - okay. \u000a\u000aMy husband splurged and got the Porcini Crusted Rib Eye ($41.95). The meat was like butter. Beautifully done. His meal came with mashed potatoes and green beans/carrots. I gotta admit the sides here are pretty disappointing. The menu states that each entree will come with the chef's recommended sides and honestly I'd like to see a bit more creativity with them and also a bit more taste as well. Fortunately the steak made up for it, and it's a damn good thing it did considering the price.\u000a\u000aLastly we required a dessert and my husband picked the M&M Cheesecake. It appeared to the dessert they were serving just for that night because it was not on the dessert menu. It was a lovely cheesecake and the addition of M&Ms was fun. My favorite part was the buttery graham cracker crust!\u000a\u000aOverall TGG is a decent dining option, especially for locals who want a nice steak but do not want to head down to the strip.

VFor those of us on the East side organic/healthy food is hard to come by. Whole Foods and Trader Joe's is a trek across the valley. Luckily this Sunflower Market comes to the rescue!\u000a\u000aAlthough not as big as TJ's or WF's Sunflower Market does the trick for a grocery shopping trip when I have a little extra cash to spend on "better" organic food. It's also a great place for me to go get those specialty items that Alberton's or Von's just don't have.\u000a\u000aTheir produce section usually boasts some interesting finds and your run of the mill stuff. I was slightly disappointed on my last shopping trip to find no berries! No berries besides strawberries. Luckily they did have the frozen variety, which I picked up a bunch bags because they were on sale! I like to have them in my oatmeal in the mornings. :)\u000a\u000aIf you compare to WF, Sunflower Market will always be lacking in some areas, but they do have pretty much everything you need for your day to day eating habits. This one is usually pretty clean and the employees are nice enough. For what it is, I say it is worthy of my shopping trips and I will continue to shop here for the foreseeable future.

VYeehaw. I needed me some boots (or so I thought).\u000a\u000aI went to Boot Barn with the intention of seeing if they had a certain pair of boots I had seen online and they did - plus so much more! The amount of boots and styles they have here (particularly the ladies section) is stellar! I had been looking online at boots and thinking I may wear a pair under my wedding dress. I thought maybe I could pull of a little country flair, after all... in reality, no one would actually see the boots unless I purposefully showed them!\u000a\u000aWell I went here with the intention of just looking and I fell in shopping love with a pair of boots. They are all easily marked and you can try them on by just pulling them off the shelves. I ended up buying a pair of really lovely boots. However, I had second, third, fourth thoughts about them the next day. Being the fickle bride-to-be I am, I actually ended up returning the boots.\u000a\u000aThroughout the whole process the staff was very nice and understanding of why I was returning the boots. The return on my card has already been processed!\u000a\u000aI will return here someday and buy some nice boots, I swear! I can't keep wearing my Mom's old vintage ones for too much longer.

VLappert's is located on the second floor of the California off of Ogden Street. Don't be a noodle-head like me and walk up and down Fremont Street wondering why you can't find the place.\u000a\u000aOnce my husband and I arrived we were greeted by an old-timey ice cream place feel, but still... it's in the California in Downtown Vegas, so you can't be entirely fooled. There is a bit of bar seating, but other than that you'll be having to take your ice cream to go here if it's busy.\u000a\u000aWe went on a Saturday night at about 7:30 PM and there was no one else there. My husband and I decided on the Chocolate Cookie Crunch, I believe is what the call it. Basically it's a cookies and cream concoction, but with chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla. We got it in a bowl so we could easily share it. \u000a\u000aQuality ice cream for sure. This ice cream has a nice mouth feel to it. No icy particles. It doesn't break-down as soon as you put your spoon in it. It stays quite solid as you eat it, which is a good sign. Also, fair portions for the price. I paid $3 even for a scoop in a cup and my husband and I shared and we were quite satisfied. This is better than going to Baskin Robbins. \u000a\u000aOverall, this is a quaint spot for dessert after dinner. It's easy to get to even though it is in a casino. You could easily walk here from one of the many dining options that are now popping up Downtown like my husband and I did. I think the next time we're Downtown for dinner we will head to Lappert's afterward to satisfy our sweet tooths.

VI know, I know... I'm reviewing AVN. \u000a\u000aWell even though I *worked* the event this year (2012) I did *experience* the event as well because I was given a full access pass to all three floors of the event. This year that included: The Joint, Muse Hall, and Festival Hall (the "novelties" aka sex toys floor). AVN took place, for the first time, at Hard Rock Hotel. AVN noted they did this because they "wanted to take over an entire casino". Well, they definitely did.\u000a\u000aI worked information booth and happened to notice a lot of people confused as to what they could and could not see. I often felt bad because people thought they could go somewhere, but were denied access. The line to get tickets was OUTSIDE of Hard Rock, in the front of the hotel, and from what I have heard, extended forever and the wait was up to two hours for some to get tickets.\u000a\u000aLook, I'd never willingly go to a porn convention, but since I had all access I figured I'd check it out. Come on, it's the PORN CONVENTION. Basically porn stars signing autographs, companies selling sexy items, and girls getting half naked. I'll admit my favorite part of the convention was actually the Sapphire Gentleman's Lounge, who had strippers getting down in the hallway between the floors.\u000a\u000aOf course, you can collect many goodies to take home with you and some are up for purchase as well. I also gained access to the International Trade Show Floor, which shows you just what's up in the land of erotica in different countries.\u000a\u000aThe Hard Rock for 4 days straight was taken over by porn stars, a lot of dudes, and people just curious, or people serious about sex, porn, and et cetera. \u000a\u000aI personally thought it was confusing for people though and cramped as could be. AVN should reconsider the location for next year.

VMost of what I find in American Apparel is quite unappealing to me. It doesn't speak to my style. I do not in any way shape or form consider myself a hipster, so walking into AA is a bit off-putting.\u000a\u000aWhat I do like: clean, bright, and they sell some items of interest at the counter. Such as Dr. Bonner's Castille soap! Interesting since I do enjoy Dr. Bonner's. However, I did not even bother to ask the price for a bar since I am sure it is some inflated, crazy price I would never pay. \u000a\u000aI came here for a "dress up" event and actually ended up finding exactly what I was looking for: socks with ruffles. Yes, just like in the days of your infancy and toddlering days. I needed these, I found them, I left.\u000a\u000aOverall this location is convenient since there are so many other stores around it to shop at. Also, American Apparel, is, well, American. Made in the USA. I like that. A lot. I just wish they made clothes I wanted to wear.

VACK. I've been to a lot of "Feast" buffets, considering I am indeed a Vegas local, but this one in particular was horrendous! I am not sure if it was just that night or if this Feast buffet just is bad in general, but yikes.\u000a\u000aCustomer service: Let's start out with one thing, when someone asks you a question, you answer it, you don't reply with something random that wasn't asked. When we walked up to the front we asked the cashier if they offer a military discount, he replied, "We offer a discount Boarding Pass members, you can go get a card over there" (and he pointed). Uh, well, my husband didn't ask you about your boarding pass card (I know, I have one, I've had one since 2006), he asked you if you offer a military discount. So we walked over and got a stupid card because we were with my MIL and FIL. Two cards = discounted buffet for four people. BY THE WAY, we also ate at the SAM'S TOWN buffet three nights before this and they gave my husband a discount when they saw his military ID without him even having to ask.\u000a\u000aNot done yet, so we get back in line and wait now that we have our Boarding Pass cards, and as we go up to the cashier, two people cut in front of us and she allows it. We moved up a little closer so we wouldn't get cut again and the cashier loudly and rudely tells us to "STEP BACK, MOVE BACK" (no please, just ordering us instructions). \u000a\u000aThe food was pretty horrendous and considering it was Saturday night I expected it to be better. I had a slice of beef and some peel-n-eat shrimp, everything else was blah. PLUS I had stomach pains the same night we ate here while I was laying in bed trying to sleep. Was it the buffet? Possibly. \u000a\u000aOverall I am really displeased with the Feast Buffet at Sunset Station. My parents, and myself have often gone to the Feast Buffet at Boulder Station, which is closer to our home, and it is much, much better than this one, especially with their customer service.\u000a\u000aI suggest the Feast Buffet at Sunset Station teach their cashiers to have a bit better customer service and learn to LISTEN to what the customers are asking rather than just blurting out commands to go and get a Boarding Pass card to get a discount.

VSloppy sandwich. Did you read that Tom? Your sandwich I paid 8 dollars for was sloppily made!\u000a\u000aI needed to eat while working at MGM. I wanted to eat at Craftsteak, but it was closed. I saw 'whichcraft and after reading reviews I was skeptical. However, it was there, it was open, there was no line.\u000a\u000aI opted for the mozzarella panini. I was weary of ordering a pricier sandwich with meat because of the mediocre reviews of most of them. Sandwich ordered to go.\u000a\u000aWait time was fast. Took my panini away and... As I ate it I realized the half I was eating only had cheese in it. Wtf, I thought. So I inspected the other half - and there was the rest of the ingredients. Slopped into the panini, spilling out the other side.\u000a\u000aCome on. If I'm going to pay over 8 bucks for a panini could it at least be well made? The flavors were decent, but the presentation was terrible. Plus how can I even rectify the ingredients dispersal situation when everything is already grilled together? That's right... I can't.\u000a\u000aIf you want a sammie go to Earl of Sandwich. At least if it sucks, you will not have paid as much for it.

VEven if sometimes I want to pummel the people who shop here for invading my space while I'm attempting to see if I really want to buy this random exotic fruit I've never heard of before I still like the store and the employees. \u000a\u000aThis Whole Foods is pretty similar to any other you've been in. Set up practically the same as all the others. The salad bar/prepared food sections are quite good. I've had pizza, burritos, and sandwiches from here. I've also gotten salads, although once I had their chicken fingers, which I warmed up in the microwave provided and they were quite gross. Do not recommend. \u000a\u000aMeanwhile in the rest of the grocery store, produce is proudly displayed, meat section is extensive. I actually had a nice chat with one of the butchers who helped me make a meat selection for my Christmas dinner. \u000a\u000aI did have an issue with them trying to run one of their new gift cards. They've changed them recently and they spent awhile trying to get mine to work. The cashier couldn't get it figured out until she called over a manager.\u000a\u000aOverall it's a good WF in Vegas.

VI am constantly on the look-out for decent places to spend a Friday or Saturday night in Las Vegas that don't include standing around a packed club having douchey guys in popped collars trying to rub their crotch against me. Luckily, Downtown Cocktail Room happens to provide a relief from such terrible adventures.\u000a\u000aLocated downtown, secluded, and wonderfully hidden from most tourists eyes the Downtown Cocktail Room is a wonderful placed to spend a night drinking with friends. Get there early enough and you'll also get a place to sit (AMAZING!) and waitresses will actually bring your drinks to you! Also, amazing. Sit in front of the window and watch people attempt to get in (the doors are a bit tricky for the uninformed, which makes this place even better). \u000a\u000aThe only reason I didn't 5 star is because sometimes the service can be a bit slow. I think my friends and I waited for our drinks for almost 10 minutes and there really wasn't a whole lot of people there yet (it was early for a Friday night). Other than that I have no complaints about this place. Oh and by the way, the drinks are fabulous, yet not over-priced, another plus plus! Try the Aviation. It's my favorite drink, besides the $5 shots of Jameson, of course.

VAs far as bars go in the Fremont East District I believe The Griffin to fall into the "okay" category.\u000a\u000aThings that I love about The Griffin are the dark, moody atmosphere set off by flickering firelight and velvety curtains and booths. It's almost, should I say, comfortable to sit down here and sip a few cocktails or beers or wines or whatever suits you.\u000a\u000aAnd then there are things I am not in love with here; the minimum bar tab in order to use a card (silly in my opinion) and the often funky smell coming from the bathroom area. The evil ATM in the back that charges an arm and a leg to take money from my own bank. Oooo, I hate those things so much.\u000a\u000aWhen I'm on one of those "hit up" numerous bar nights I usually do like to slip into The Griffin for a bit, but if I'm just heading down to one bar, I'll probably go somewhere else.

VI need to return to Mickie Finnz someday to try something different than what I had last night after the Yelp event at Commonwealth. I was buzzing off alcohol so my review isn't completely based off of a sober palate. \u000a\u000aThe many times I have been Downtown I have always passed by Mickie Finnz assuming it was just another bar. I had no idea they actually had food. It is usually overshadowed by Hennessy's - the tavern next door that I used to frequent quite often while trying to max out my Jameson stamp card.\u000a\u000aBut back to Finnz - basically my friends and I needed food after drinking so much, so actually, this place was perfect. They offer a very eclectic menu, with some sandwiches, "munchies" (apps), and "Buckets" of seafood. I didn't really care to have a bucket last night so I went for a "munchie" instead.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Chimichanga appetizers. I did not know what to expect because I was ordering Mexican food at an Irish sounding seafood place. (?) They came out naked aka they were not smothered with red sauce and cheese like you will typically get chimichangas. However, they were deep fried to a nice crispy exterior and hot interior of ground beef. I was surprised by the ground beef - usually chimichangas are shredded, but it did not deter me from eating them. They also come with a salsa, pico de gallo, sour cream, and lettuce. You can basically fork on whatever you like onto each chimichanga as you eat it. The platter comes with four of the mini chimichangas.\u000a\u000aOur service was pretty good, our waitress nice. Although it would have been nice to have had our waters filled a little more often. \u000a\u000aLike I said, I need to go back and give it another try. Next time I'll probably go for some seafood and get one of those "buckets" of fried deliciousness. For now I am giving the rating of A-OK.

VOne of my favorite spots in Vegas, now if only it weren't so far away. Hmmph.\u000a\u000aRed Rock is the best "Station" casino in my opinion. I try not to review a casino until I've been fully invested in it and tried a bunch of its features. As a resident of Las Vegas, this review does not include the rooms/front desk experience, so when deciding whether or not to STAY at Red Rock, better to read another review!\u000a\u000aEntertainment-wise I have to give 5 stars. Their movie theaters are nice and well kept. The bowling alley is pretty much awesome, if not a tad expensive. Their pool-side concerts are often a great way to spend a Saturday/Friday night in the summer. \u000a\u000aAs for dining, I have eaten at hachi, the Japanese restaurant and I thought there was nothing wrong with the experience. I've also had The Yard House on ocassion, as well as The Bagel Cafe, which offers deli-style sandwiches that are great for an after-movie meal! There is also a food court which features a Rubios. I do like Rubios, so having it here is a great option.\u000a\u000aOverall - 5 Stars for Red Rock.

VI'm a fan of Panera Bread in general. They're good for an alternative to Quiznos or Subway. It *seems* like you're eating a little healthier as well, but I won't hold my breathe on whether or not that is actually true. \u000a\u000aThis particular one can get super packed, but I was there today right around lunchtime on a Saturday and my friend and I didn't wait at all to get our orders in. \u000a\u000aI like that they have people who come around and take your plates from your table when you're done. Also, I am a HUGE fan of the chips they serve with their sandwiches. Extra crunchy and tasty! My go-to sandwich is the Ceasar Salad Sandwich and I always get it with half the cheese they normally put on it. The romaine lettuce always has a snap and the tomatoes and red onions are always rockin'. \u000a\u000aOverall Panera is a good stop for a quick lunch or if you're hankering for a sammich and you just want to go for an old stand-by.

VJimmy John's is unique in the fact that they do actually make subs so fast you'll freak. Their catch phrase is really put to work at this location, and others. \u000a\u000aMy faves are the beach club, for the sprouts, and the country club (add bacon) for just being a simple sandwich. I also favor their slim subs, which cost less, and don't have a ton of toppings/meat and cheese. \u000a\u000aThe bread is tasty, soft, with a light crunch on the outside. Also they have awesome chips. No lame Lays or Cheetohs. It's the Jimmy John's brand chips and I favor the salt and vinegar.\u000a\u000aI've always had good service here as well.

VI came with a friend and a Restaurant.com gift certificate for $10. I was pretty excited to come here because I rarely eat Asian cuisines. Usually I am a pho person and nothing more, unless it's sushi, which sometimes in the good 'ol U. S. of A. you can't really even consider the type of sushi served actual sushi per Japanese standards. With the being said, launch into my review.\u000a\u000aFood - My friend and I shared the Octopus Balls and the Poki. Immediately I was overtaken by the saltiness of the poki dish. Just too much. Octopus balls were a nice treat and actually had a decent amount of meat in them\u000a\u000aBoth my friend and I ordered the Tan Tan Men Ramen. This was my first time having ramen. I thought it was decent. The noodles were good, but it wasn't too spicy to me anyway, until I happened to get a bit of the broth in my eye. Yes, go me. Broth in the eye. Overall the taste was not totally satisfactory, but I don't have much to go off of. I believe now I will branch out and try some ramen elsewhere, just to see how Shuseki's stacks up.\u000a\u000aService - Meh, meh, meh. Although our server arrived to our table quickly to take our orders and bring food he was non-existent for most of the time. My water glass sat unfilled for quite awhile while I was really wanting some water. \u000a\u000aMy Restaurant.com GC was met with some speculation when we were ready to pay our bill. I was just getting ready for a confrontation, but then the server whisked away my debit card and the GC. When he came back he had charged my debit card an additional $4.43 for "included tip" which I was not told would be included. Um, what? We were only a part of two. Pretty sure the "tip included" part came because we had used the gift certificate. If it's the restaurant's policy to include tip along with gift certificate's they should include that on the GC. But my GC said nothing of a tip being included and I've used Restaurant.com quite a bit and I have never had this happen to me before.\u000a\u000aThe $4.43 tip was annoying and the fact that they did not bother to tell me I would be charged a tip prior to running my card was even more annoying. It is not okay to charge someone more just because you feel like it and especially if there is nowhere on the menu, in the restaurant, or on my GC that says I will be charged.\u000a\u000aConsidering I *was* going to leave a tip for $5 the server got shorted. I'm guessing the restaurant does this because they might assume people who use gift certificates may leave poor tips. I am not one of those people and I think it's poor business to assume everyone who comes through your door are cheap-asses. Also, if Shuseki put out the gift certificates they are obviously trying to get business in the door. Unfortunately for them and their assumptions regarding myself - I will not be back.

VI'm not sure there's much I can say that hasn't already said about Inn n Out in general or this Inn n Out in particular.\u000a\u000aOverall Inn n Out never disappoints. The burgers are delicious, fresh and the cheese always perfectly melted. The lettuce has a crunch and the tomatoes aren't mealy. Things you would think would be expected of most places that serve burgers, but often these goals aren't met - except for Inn n Out. Quality burgers. All the time.\u000a\u000aOverall I'm a fan of the Double Double with grilled onions. And their chocolate shakes. Damn good.\u000a\u000aThis Inn n Out has a small parking lot and it is slightly awkward to get into if you are heading North on Maryland Parkway. However, these all issues are trumped by great customer service and even better food. Highly recommend.

VMy first stop of Restaurant Week 2013 and my one out of two, unfortunately. *clown tear*\u000a\u000aWell my friends and I had reservations for 6 PM, which must be right before S&W gets all their reservations typically because when I walked in expecting to see a bustling restaurant crickets were chirping instead. However, when we walked out around 8:15 PM, the place was packed. \u000a\u000aThe interior is old-school steakhouse, dim lighting, etc. It's like 1910 elegance, you know, before the stock market crashed and people stood in line for a piece of bread. The plush, cushy chairs are perfect for sitting back and stuffing your face with indulgent food and delicious steaks.\u000a\u000aOur server was cordial and had a light sense of humor. I have a feeling since we were a group of young ladies his demeanor was a tad different from what he would have presented had we been three businessmen. Of course, that's not a problem for the waitstaff to be versatile. \u000a\u000aFood - I ordered off the RW menu, a fixed price of $40 (and some change). I received the Wollensky Salad - a salad with crisp romaine lettuce, served with warm, large chunks of bacon and mushrooms. Also - tomatoes.. um, two tomatoes to be exact. Is there a problem with tomatoes lately? Seems as though they appear sparser and sparser in my salads at restaurants. The salad was good, and filling. \u000a\u000aDeconstructed Beef Wellington with Foie Gras. (Originally $42). This meal comes out very simplistic on a large white plate. Along with the meat you receive three slender carrots and three slender asparagus. The meat is cooked medium-rare, which I said yes to because I have never had beef wellington so I decided to go with the recommendation. The "deconstruction" part is the fact that the beef wellington is served differently than normal, but with all the elements still there. The meat is cut up, the foie gras is not wrapped around all of the meat, and the puff pastry is on the bottom of the meat, more like a platter than a wrapper, which is what is normal. Overall I enjoyed the dish, the meat was simply divine and I did not have a chewy bit. I did run into a few bits of overcooked foie gras, being that it was a bit crunchy. Typically I do not eat my meat medium rare and I found the fact that the meal came out much cooler than I'm used to a bit strange at first, but perhaps something I can stomach when eating a beef wellington in the future.\u000a\u000aChocolate cake - chocolate meh. I wasn't impressed. I've had much better cake elsewhere, but obviously desserts is not their forte. Skip dessert, go somewhere else after your meal. Or just have another cocktail instead.\u000a\u000aCocktails - I had two of the same, something called  French martini. Very girly and pink. Swirly, swirly! I liked it, no complaints.\u000a\u000aSides (not included on RW Menu) - We decided to get two sides to share between the three of us. We went for the truffled mac n cheese and the mushrooms. Mushrooms to me were all right. But since I had had mushrooms on my salad and I had mushrooms with the beef wellington I only had a spoonful of them. The mac and cheese though - heaven! Perfectly creamy, just enough of a breading on top for a crunch, and just straight up gooey goodness that is sooo bad for you, but it's soooo good. \u000a\u000aFor the RW 2013 S&W gets a 4-star rating. Now, would I return to pay full price? Yes, I think I would. I also like that they have a lunch menu, something I would love to explore. Also, currently when you check-in with Yelp you can receive a deal, so that is always a plus for us Yelpers!\u000a\u000aGood job S&W and thank you for a fabulous meal.

VArrrghh! Why do you constantly disappoint me Einstein's?! And why do I go back?\u000a\u000aI guess the answer to the first question lies in the fact that I go to Einstein's expecting to be treated like an individual ordering MY individual bagel, with MY individual tastes at least somewhat considered. The very first time I had Einstein's was at this location on Maryland Parkway, in fact, I've never been to another Einstein's, so my impression of this franchise is based solely off this one location. \u000a\u000aI have never ordered one of their bagel sandwiches. I have always ordered bagels with cream cheese, or as they like to refer to it "spread". The first time I ordered here I realized when they put cream cheese on a bagel they PUT CREAM CHEESE on a bagel. It's more cream cheese than bagel. Lesson learned - ask for less spread.\u000a\u000aI have been back multiple times and I have always asked for LESS SPREAD. Yet constantly my bagel comes to me smeared and over-loaded with spread. Maybe I'm asking too much? But come on! I believe once I ordered the bagel with the spread on the side. Now thank goodness, that's a good idea because then these over-zealous bagel ruiners don't get a chance to get their cream cheese explosion guns all over my poor little bagel. \u000a\u000aNow to answer question number two. Why do I go back? I guess it's because of the *bagels*. They have a great selection and the bagels themselves are delicious. I also enjoy the fact that you can order a coffee and go back to refill it as many times as you please. The fact that it is at least somewhat close to where I live is convenient for me. \u000a\u000aBut... still, when a customer asks for less spread and I don't get it, that's unacceptable. There are three people working behind the counter typically. The person who takes the order should be able to communicate to the other employees what the customer wants. I suspect there may be a break-down in the communication here. Because if I ask for somethin specifically and the person taking the order even repeats it back to me correctly... what happened in between the time I placed the order and I received it?\u000a\u000aBut I digress. Until I find a more convenient place to get my bagel fix on, Einstein's it is.

VAfter a long dry run of not desiring bagels I was out and about this morning very early without having had anything to eat. By the time I got around to listening to my stomach talk to me for an hour I decided I better feed it and I decided on a bagel.\u000a\u000aNow, my first review of Einstein's was not very good because they tend to tick me off with the amount of spread they put on their bagels. It is also super corporatized and I feel like a "cog in the machine" when I get bagels here. But I digress - I keep coming back out of habit and probably laziness in finding a better bagel place.\u000a\u000aToday I was much happier with my meal. It was simple: regular coffee, jalapeno bagel (toasted), with plain spread on the side. My order came out fast, even though the line was long and the coffee was piping hot and good.\u000a\u000aEinstein's gets a kick up to A-OK for me. I'm not saying I'm a fan though.

VMy dog Twain sure is picky. He has decided he does not like some of the things I bring him home from Flea Bag's, but that does not mean I don't LOVE this place. \u000a\u000aWhenever I go to The District I always make a stop here to pick up some doggy treats. I love their bakery style set up. I usually always pick up a few different treats for the pup here! They always have new, fun treats. Fun for me to pick out and of course, makes my pup jump for joy.\u000a\u000aI can't comment on the dog food since they don't carry the brand I feed my dog, but they do have a decent selection of toys, collars, etc. There are a lot of healthy little treats here as well. Mostly it's a bunch of stuff for those lil tea-cup dogs, and my dog definitely does not fit the bill there.\u000a\u000aOh and the staff are amazing. I have always been treated to very kind and congenial conversation here. So if you need some tasty treats for your four legged type friends than you should check this place out.

VI think a lot of people are going to Blondie's for the wrong reasons. The thing is you gotta walk into this place knowing what you're getting yourself into. Blondie's is basically a Hooters that hosts beer pong games. Forget about the food, forget about anything else but beer and you'll be okay. Am I saying it makes up for their poor service and prick bartenders? Nope. But I'm just making a point.\u000a\u000aI went here last night, pretty damn late with a group of guys (a majority of whom were Marines). We went to play beer pong pretty much and that is what we did. The beer pong tables were pretty packed and everyone around us was having a good time. It was pretty loud and fun and all the people around us were nice (tossing back balls, joking, just having a good time). It was 4th of July weekend so we were all doing what Americans do... drinking beer and yelling about how much we love America.\u000a\u000aWould I go out of my way to eat here? No. Would I go back if I weren't with a bunch of Marines playing beer pong? No. But it's a fun time for what it is.

VIt's hard to review something as standard as getting your eyes checked and getting new glasses, but I'm going to give it a go anyway. This Lenscrafters is located in the Boulevard Mall off of Maryland (hello GHETTO). But it is the closest to me and I have been a customer here since... well, since my eyesight went to shit at about the age of 19.\u000a\u000aI had lost my glasses almost a year ago and I had not had a check-up on my eyes for about 3+ years. It was time. So here's one thing that ticks me off and I'm not sure if this is just Lenscrafters or if it's just anywhere you go to buy glasses: WHY are all the glasses designer labels? I don't understand. They are glasses! I need them to SEE, not to make a fashion statement!\u000a\u000aAfter I got my eyes all lasered and read the charts and all that jazz I went to pick out my frames. Do my eyes deceive me? Are all these glasses $99.95 or more? Why yes, they are, because they are Dolce & Gabbana!\u000a\u000aIt just seems unfair to me that all the decent frames come with a symbol on them that means I have to pay upward of $70 markup. All of the frames that are not designer labels are horribly ugly. \u000a\u000aAnyway, I did find a decent pair and the customer service with getting them ready for me was fine. My mother and I browsed the mall for the 30-mins it took for them to make my glasses. Overall the customer service was good.

VSorry Freed's you have diminished since your move to Henderson. I used to frequent Freed's when they were on the East Side of town. \u000a\u000aI went here today with my mother for two reasons:\u000a\u000a1. I wanted a delicious treat\u000a2. I am getting married and was interested in looking into their wedding cakes\u000a\u000aFirst off the shop IS nice. It is clean, everything smelt so yummy when we walked in. The place where (I assume) they do consultations for wedding/event cakes, etc was behind a glass panel. My mother and I walked in and all the women were busy so we started taking a look at their books with pictures of cakes.\u000a\u000aEventually someone came up to us and asked us if we had been helped. I said no and proceeded to ask this person about whether or not they make traditional French wedding cakes. These wedding cakes are called croquembouches. Considering Freed's makes many other things besides cakes I assumed they would at least KNOW what a croquembouche WAS. Well, this lady had no idea what I was talking about. I don't mean to be a snot, and I'm certainly not a snob, but seriously... how can you work in a wedding cake consultation place at a bakery that makes many confectioneries and at least not know what a croquembouche is?\u000a\u000aAfter my mother and I left the dazed and confused wedding cake woman we went back into the bakery and proceeded to wait a heinously long amount of time to get our 1 piece of red velvet cake and our 1 cannoli. They were good... but not THAT good.\u000a\u000aObviously I'm taking my Frenchy wedding cake dreams elsewhere to the many other bakeries/cake makers in Las Vegas who know what a croquembouche is.

VAfter reading all the reviews here regarding puppy mills and Petland it makes me a bit sad. I have never bought a dog here, but I do shop here for pet related items such as dog food and dog treats.\u000a\u000aPetland has a credit card you can acquire to use, which I have and which is why I sometimes go out of my way to buy dog food here. Sometimes they will run really good specials on dog food (I got a large bag of Science Diet for only $25.99). When you buy certain items here once you buy so many you get one free. Each time you purchase they will give you a receipt and tell you how many more items to go before you receive your free purchase. \u000a\u000aAnytime I have gone in the staff is actually quite nice. There has never been a time I haven't been greeted or been asked if I needed help carrying my dog food out to my car. Unfortunate to hear about the puppy mill situation, but honestly, I am pretty aware of the fact that places like this get their dogs from mills. I'm not condoning it, but the 3-star rating is not based off of that fact, just my experiences in the store.

VSouth Point is a decent casino/hotel. If anything it is on the smaller side. I have been to Stations casinos that are bigger than the South Point. At least there's something nice in the fact that is is small - no getting lost! You can find everything off the main casino floor.\u000a\u000aThe casino itself has a subtle Western theme. It is NOT in yo face Western theme though. I think they've done a good job making it subtle to keep cowboys here during things such as PBR and NFR, yet make it locally friendly for Las Vegans who live in the surrounding areas.\u000a\u000aI can't say much about any of the restaurants or the rooms. The only thing I've sampled from here is drinks from both the main, large bar in the middle of the casino floor, the small cocktail lounge, and the smaller bar in the back. Drinks were fair in my opinion. Not too expensive and had decent amounts of alcohol. \u000a\u000aOverall this is a great place to hang out in Vegas during things such as PBR and NFR, as stated above. If you want to ogle cowboy butts in Wranglers, this is the place to do it.

VUSAA is the best of the best of the best. I'm not kidding. They know what they're doing Everything from their website navigation, user friendly online banking, and their SUPERB customer service. "Really?" "Superb." "Keep it up." "Superb." "Say it again." "Superb."\u000a\u000aWell, Empire Records quote out of the way, I have been with USAA ever since... forever. I was grandfathered in under my Dad who is a retired USAF Lt. Colonel. Actually, I first started dealing with them directly when I opened my first Master Card as an 18 year old before moving out and going to college. And then soon after I dealt with USAA's customer service line numerous times because my car loan and car insurance are through them.\u000a\u000aWhenever I called them about anything their customer service representatives have been angels. I say they've been angels because compared to other customer service reps at other companies I've spoken to these people have to be from another plane of existence to consistently be so amazing. I've called crying because I locked my keys in my car, or just confused over something having to do with registering my car and not being able to get my proof of insurance printed out in enough time (gee, the wonders of a irresponsible teenage college student). But every time they have been great. Going on 9 years now they have never let me down.\u000a\u000aAs soon as I snag myself a full time job I am moving my checking account over to USAA. They offer direct deposit and deposit from home. They also offer a set amount of money to be returned to your bank account at the end of every month if you happen to take out money at one of those nasty ATMs that charge you an arm and a leg for use. I hate that and knowing I could get that money back would be awesome. \u000a\u000aMy plan is to be with USAA forever. I have no reason to switch to anyone else. They've been in my family for a long time. My parents, me, my brother, and sister have all been with them for some reason or another and they have never done us wrong.

VI've been to this BWW so many times it may be weird that I'm giving it the two star rating. But the problem is I've been to other BWW's in the valley that are just SO much better than this one.\u000a\u000aHere are the pro's: The place has a ton of TVs for your sports entertainment. Pair with a few beers, some wings and you got yourself a decent time with some friends. The wings are delicious, plenty of different spices to choose from. I personally prefer the boneless wings. The bar is decent as well, and I ALWAYS sit in the bar area. So that being said I can't comment on service in the restaurant portion of the place. Also to be noted - I've usually always had the same male bartender when I've been here and his service is actually great. He gets one of my stars all to himself.\u000a\u000aCons: It just isn't run as well as the other BWWs around town. Plus the place sometimes has a rank smell. I'm not sure what it is... but one time I went here and I literally walked out because there were soooo many people and it was just reeking of BO. Is it all the guys in there watching sports? I don't know... but maybe there should be a showering before entering policy or something. Oh and I've seen people in their cars getting baked out behind the place as well. Just not cool.\u000a\u000aLastly, it's a good place if you're a single lady and you want to find some cutie guys. Note - especially military as it is in the North Las Vegas area close to the AFB.\u000a\u000aSo there you have it. For some reason I'm sure I'll be back here... even though it's a pretty "meh" experience.

VI LOVE this Target! It is so much bigger with more selections than the Targets on my side of town. When I went here on a whim because I happened to be out on the west side of town I couldn't believe how much better stocked this Target was than other stores I have been to.\u000a\u000aThe aisles are clean and there is much more merchandise to pick from. I noted this specifically in the home decor section, which had a wonderful selection of mirrors, wall art, lamps, and side tables. These things are sparse at other Targets around the East side.\u000a\u000aI like the setup of this Target as well. I think Greatland Targets should replace ALL Targets because it makes the quality of the shopping experience much better. \u000a\u000aAll in all I wish this place were closer to me, but even with the lengthy drive it may become my go-to Target from now on.

VFive Stars you say? But why? Why 5 Stars?\u000a\u000aI'm giving The District Five Stars because I have come to adore The District over the past couple years. It has strangely enough become a staple of my trips to Henderson. I often look forward to a trip to The District as it hosts many of my favorite shopping spots. Normally I head over for a few reasons: I need cards from Hallmark, I'd like to browse Williams & Sonoma or pop into the doggy boutique to buy some treats for my dogs. The District also hosts Whole Foods as well.\u000a\u000aAs for restaurants I've been to a few of them: Al's Garage, Presidio Rachel's Kitchen, of course, the Panera Bread, and Coffee Bean (love it!). \u000a\u000aThey have events, you can see people walking their dogs and honest to goodness it almost feels like you aren't really in Vegas anymore when you're here. \u000a\u000aOverall this is one of my favorite shopping areas in Las Vegas/Henderson. Love it.

VFremont Street is original Vegas. It is a must-see for tourists and a hangout spot for many Vegas locals, myself included. Since being back in Vegas for going on three years now I have honed in on Fremont Street or just what I refer to as "Downtown" as my go-to Friday or Saturday night outing.\u000a\u000aThe obvious is the light show, live bands, neon lights, and the casinos. But there is also the people dressed up as characters, pandering hobos, hipsters galore, random tourists, and so much more. A night spent here will bring you many laughs while walking the length of the enclosed portion.\u000a\u000aI like Hennessey's Tavern which is located here and the Las Vegas Country Saloon. The drinks are extremely inexpensive compared to the strip.\u000a\u000aAnd if you are going go to Fremont Street Experience you might as well check out "Fremont East", which is just East (erm, yah it's East... haha) of the FSE. It includes wonderful bars such as Downtown Cocktail Lounge, The Gryffon, Beauty Bar, Insert Coins, Vanguard, and many more. \u000a\u000aI would rather take friends from out of town here than anywhere else in Las Vegas. I'm going to admit, it is not everyone's cup of tea. I am sure there are people who wouldn't even think about stepping foot in this place (in fact I know people like that!), but for most people this is going to be a fun time, so check it out.

VHere's the real skinny on Ali Baba - either you're going to hate it or love it. There's probably not much in between.\u000a\u000aAs for me, my husband and I attended a friend's birthday party here on a Saturday night. As other reviews have mentioned this place gets poppin' on the weekends. My husband and I arrived as the first of the anyone in the party to get there. We were seated at one of the many long tables. That's a thing with Ali Baba, it does seem as though they tend to serve large groups, not small dining parties. I wonder if this is because of a tradition in Lebanese culture? I'm not sure.\u000a\u000aAnyway, the place is dimly lit, with a disco ball spinning in one corner above the dance floor and musician's stage. There is a bar area toward the back. The whole of the restaurant is painted with Middle Eastern type scenes. \u000a\u000aOn Saturday night they have a band and a singer (yes, a real singer) who sings VERY loudly and everyone cheers and claps and some people sing along. Well, the only way you can sing along is if you know what language he is singing in! People get up and dance all through the night and through their dinners. The singer roams the dining area enticing people to sing and clap with him. it's like a Mexican place that has a band/singers, but taken to the next level. \u000a\u000aBy the way, they do hookah here directly on the tables while food is being served. So, if that ain't in your ball park, go elsewhere or it's going to seriously ruin your dining experience if others in the restaurant are partaking of the option, which our party was. I thought it was deliciously naughty and fun to be able to smoke, eat, and drink all at the same time. ;)\u000a\u000aAs for the food and drinks, and this is honestly one of only two dings I had regarding our experience here. I find the pricing to be a little much. My husband ordered a Jack and Coke and it cost him $10 (plus tip). I mean yikes. That's crazy. Plus, the food is NOT cheap. You can get food such as this elsewhere at lower prices. \u000a\u000aWhat we had food-wise was appetizer plates split between our entire group. We got two orders of their Grand Mezza (which was actually too much for 10 people). It came with: Hommos, Tabbouleh, Baba Ghanouj, Labneh, Falafel, Kebbehballs, Mixed Pies (Cheese, Spinach, Meat), Fool Medamas, Sujok, Bastermaand Grape Leaves. I honestly cannot at this point in time remember what I actually ate, although I tried to get a bit of everything. I thought everything had great flavor and was tasty. The only thing I did not like was the Bastermaand Grape Leaves. Too much of a bitter flavor. I think I would have to go back and really sit down and know what I was eating to really give a good review on the food. But overall, for our party these dishes worked well.\u000a\u000aWe also ordered two bottles of Arak for the table. This is the national alcoholic drink of Lebanon and it is 100 proof liquor and it is not cheap. We all imbibed and we were all very merry. We danced and clapped and ate and smoked and danced some more and ate and drank some more.\u000a\u000aHonestly I loved partying here! I thought it was fun. The only issue I had was that it was just a tad too loud to hear much of what my party was saying. \u000a\u000aBesides the loudness and the high-prices Ali Baba was an awesome time. I would defintiely recomend if you are lookiing for something a bit different for a large group party.

VThis is a very nice Subway. I stopped in here after work one night and was in desperate need of sandwiches for me and my fiance. I happened to have one of those buy-one-get-one coupons I received in the mail and the worker here was very happy to honor the coupon. He didn't even really look at it.\u000a\u000aThe sandwiches were made very well and the young man behind the counter was very jovial and nice to me. I was afraid it was maybe a bit too late and they were closing, but he ensured me all was good and they were actually open for another hour.\u000a\u000aHonestly I've been to a lot of Subways, but this one in particular is being run by very good management because it shows in the decorum of their employees AND the fresh/well put together sandwiches.

VMy go-to when I have any kind of chicken wing is typically a boneless wing with mild hot sauce. Suffice to say, Wing Stop can provide me with that when I feel like it. However, I think BWW beats Wing Stop in the boneless category. If you're going to go to Wing Stop definitely get the bone-in. They are massive with lots 'o meat! Very different from most chicken wings.\u000a\u000aOn my last trip here I went out of the box and got half of my wings mild and the other half the lemon-pepper (it's a rub) and I did it based off of Melia S.'s review. Well, luckily I wasn't disappointed. I really did enjoy the lemon-pepper, but unfortunately my mild wings barely had any sauce on them! Most of the sauce was pooled in the bottom of the container. Kind of disappointing.\u000a\u000aI have had their yummy french fries in the past, but the last time I got fries from this location they were kinda soggy and not so good. I guess you just gotta get them at the right time or something. \u000a\u000aAlso, and the last thing - their ranch here is very thin, not goopy, and I mean goopy in a good way, like when I have a chicken wing I want the ranch to STICK to it, not roll off! \u000a\u000aOverall Wing Stop is a good fix if you need those chicken wings!

VOver the course of many years living in Las Vegas and attending events such as: concerts, rodeos, ice skating shows, and yes, even graduating from high school in the Thomas & Mack center I must say I do appreciate this venue.\u000a\u000aAs of the past few days I have been working at the National Finals Rodeo which is held in the T&M every year. I think the versatility of this venue is key. Connected to T&M is the Cox Pavilion and close by is the garage and plenty of parking. I believe the parking situation is one of the best I have experienced at large events and venues like the T&M.\u000a\u000aInside the staff is friendly for the most part and helpful. You rarely run into an usher or an employee who can not either 1. answer your question or 2. find someone who can answer your question.\u000a\u000aAs for the aging of the stadium, I believe it has aged gracefully and UNLV has kept it up and running nicely with plenty of renovations. The outside of the T&M is clean as can be and you can't help but enjoy yourself as you walk up the stairs to the concourse.\u000a\u000aWhether you're going to root on the Runnin' Rebs or just seeing a concert the T&M is a venue that will not disappoint.

VI've been frequenting Nellis AFB since I was a small child. As long as I can remember I've had access to the base because my father is retired military (now). I've seen this base go through many, many changes as Generals have come and gone.\u000a\u000aOverall I think the base is pretty nice. They are building a new gym, there's a golf course, pretty good, nothing spectacular though. There is also a bowling center, movies and a few fast food places.\u000a\u000aThe BX and Shoppette are nicely located and provide decent shopping. The commissary has been remodeled a few times from what I can remember, and it does its job of being a place to get groceries.\u000a\u000aI personally enjoy the planes you can walk by and look at by the entrance off of Nellis. Also, you can get discounted tickets to Vegas shows and theme parks from the base which is pretty cool.

VI am a big fan of Qdoba. I have been since I was in college in Reno and a Qdoba opened up not too far from my apartment. This place was awash with kids from the University all the time. Mainly because it was the first place of its kind to open up in Reno. No one had really experienced this type of fast-food movement before. Reno had Qdoba before it had Chipotle.\u000a\u000aOverall I like both Chipotle and Qdoba. There are a few subtle differences, but for the most part is the same style, same food, same way of doing things.\u000a\u000aThe one thing I enjoy different about Qdoba is the their Queso Burrito, which Chipotle does not have. Basically you get a burrito (or anything I guess) and you can have queso dumped on it. Thus making your somewhat "healthy" meal completely and utterly unhealthy (add sour cream for extra fatness, yay!).\u000a\u000aThis particular location is in a very busy shopping center. Parking is quite limited. The restaurant itself is also on the small side. But, I've never waited long for the food and the employees for the most part are quick and cordial. \u000a\u000aI would give 5 stars, but since being introduced to Chipotle I think I like the Chipotle style just slightly better than Qdoba, unless of course I want queso. Well, then the choice is clear.

VI came here for a medical evaluation for a job I am applying to. I am not a person who gets nervous about anything medical, but it is nice to have any nervousness assuaged by good staff and a clean property.\u000a\u000aI had to be tested for my hearing, eyesight, and for drugs. Ya, I know most of you know what that means. Anyway, the girl who worked with me was really nice and knew what she was doing. I felt as though I was in good hands.\u000a\u000aThe exam room was clean and sterile and the doctor was quick and efficient. I don't think there's much more you can ask for in an exam room and wellness center.

VI'm not sold... yet. \u000a\u000aI stopped by here for lunch today because I've driven past the place numerous times. I am a Philly Cheesesteak fanatic by the way, so it takes a little bit more than saying you're "straight from Philly" to impress me. Albeit, I have never actually been to Philadelphia (believe me, it's on my short list of places I MUST visit). \u000a\u000aI ordered the small Philly Cheesesteak ($5) and a drink. My total came to around $7. I guess it's an okay price, but the cheesesteak wasn't anything to rave about. I got it with provolone (sorry, I know it's an abomination not to get it with Cheez Whiz). It was indeed small, but at least it was packed with meat. I still feel kinda hungry after eating it though.\u000a\u000aPerhaps I'll be back... I might try something else, but honestly if you can't impress me with the small Philly Cheesesteak, why should I come back?

VThis shop is so KAWAII! =^_^=\u000a\u000aI used to really be into anime (specifically Sailor Moon) so going into this shop and seeing Sailor Moon (Say-LAH MOON!) items was really fun. They also offer more than just anime things, also Sanrio items, Japanese snack foods, and condiment items. There are also plates, dishes, bento boxes, and hair products.\u000a\u000aThis is your one-stop shop for fun items from Tokyo (obviously). The shop itself is a bit small and kind of crowded. Items are bit disorganized as well. It reminds me of shops like this you will find in San Fran's Chinatown. Other than that the shop is very cool. \u000a\u000aI actually kind of regret not getting the Sailor Moon cell phone adornment I saw...

VI realize I am reviewing a fast-food eatery, but please hear me out because I wanted the world to know what I experienced at this particular location. This is kind of a public service announcement.\u000a\u000aOriginally I wanted to go through the drive-thru, but my husband insisted we eat inside. Once inside I was overtaken by the smell of dog food. I'm not even kidding. Straight up folks. I couldn't think of what else the smell would be. I couldn't bring myself to eat here. I told my husband we were leaving immediately.\u000a\u000aI am not sure what makes that smell, but it does not belong in ANY place that is serving *human* food.

VI have an issue with Coffee Bean. The drinks are so tasty and they don't offer a small size so I am forced to drink a big, yummy drink! Haha. Okay, so it's not really a bad issue, but I wish they did have three sizes instead of two, especially for the ice blended drinks. Usually they're too much for me to drink and I end up throwing away part of it.\u000a\u000aThis particular Coffee Bean location is in The District and has a lot of outdoor seating. There are also misters, which make for a nice place to sit and enjoy the late afternoon/early evening, even in Vegas, if it is not too hot in the summer. \u000a\u000aHonestly I don't think they're any better or worse than Starbucks. They're just kind of an alternative. Yes, the drinks do taste a bit different, but not so much so that I would pick one over the other for which one I like better. Although Coffee Bean does have less of that big corporation vibe.\u000a\u000aI've never had an issue with service here. All the employees have been quite nice and tend to be on the younger side.\u000a\u000aAND Coffee Bean does a promotion for U.S. Soldiers to get them coffee. I don't know if they do it on a rotating basis or what, but two or three times I've been in this particular Coffee Bean they have offered customers the chance to purchase a bag of coffee beans for soldiers. You can write a note on the bag as well. Any company that's sending some good 'ol coffee to our boys is a good company indeed!

VI haven't had Baja in awhile, but after the gym last night I was craving their yummy fish tacos. I've always been a fan of the fish tacos, because there's so few "fast" Mexican places you can grab decent fish items. Plus I do love their taquitos with the tasty cheese dipping sauce as well.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately I think Baja has gone down hill in the past few years since its magnificent presence began infesting cities in Nevada and other places. Yes, it may still be "fresh" compared to say, Del Taco, but it is lacking.\u000a\u000aI ordered the fish tacos, and was surprised they were so bland. I had to drench them in salsa (supposedly "hot" salsa... which was not... hot.). The fish was dry and unseasoned and it was like a long, stick of fish. It literally almost reminded me of putting a fish stick into a taco shell and calling it a day.\u000a\u000aWhy is the salsa bland now? Why is the fish not fresh? Is there a new CEO cutting corners, or is it just this particular establishment?\u000a\u000aI don't know, but I DO know I am probably going to make the trip to Rubio's in Henderson from now on if I really want some good fish tacos.

VDisclaimer - I do not go to Arby's on my own, my husband loves this place and I will go here on occasion with him. \u000a\u000aWith that being said though, I did end up signing up for their email alerts because I figured if my husband was going to eat here so often it would be good to get some deals on the food. They do send out some pretty decent coupons every once and awhile. PLUS - they sent me a FREE milkshake coupon for my birthday. I decided we had to go a few days ago so I could redeem my coupon.\u000a\u000aFirst off this location is in the ghetto on Boulder Highway. Luckily, the restaurant itself is actually quite clean and well kept. The lobbies in Arby's tend to look a little more "swank" (HA HA) than most other fast food establishments. They have mood lighting and cooshy benches to sit on while you dine. \u000a\u000aSecond - We went and their shake machine was out of business. *womp womp womp*. The entire reason I came was busted, but of course, my husband still wanted a sandwich. We ordered one and a side of Mozzarella Sticks. I know it's just fried cheese and how bad is fried cheese for you? "Really bad Ashley" says my inner organic-food-voice. BUT I don't care. I love fried cheese dipped in marinara sauce! \u000a\u000aPlus the manager here was very nice and offered us two free drinks since I couldn't use my coupon and she was willing to write on my coupon so I could use it at a later date. However, my coupon was not on the verge of expiring so I just said I would come back later.

VI'd like to give Aloha Kitchen more Stars, but I was disappointed with my meal this afternoon. I've been here only on two occasions, but I do have plans to go back and try them again since they are so convenient. I think the convenience factor for me is the best part of this establishment. Considering there is nothing but fast food around my house, this place IS a nice refreshing way to get food fast.\u000a\u000aThus far I have had the Mahi Mahi & Katsu Combo Plate and the Kalua Pork/Katsu combo. I think it's hard to make bad katsu, so I don't have any issues with their katsu chicken. The Kalua Pork I had was pretty damn good, although maybe I tad too salty for me to eat the whole thing. However, it was juicy, hot and delicious. As for the mahi mahi, I was kind of disappointed. Maybe the way they do their mahi mahi is just not my thing, but I really did not enjoy it.\u000a\u000aAs for the sides, they're usually okay. Macaroni and salad is kinda hard to screw up. But sometimes I find their rice to be mooshy and not very good. \u000a\u000aPersonally I would rather go to 808 Mix Plate, but it's incredibly far from my house. :(

VThis pizza spot is located in a shady strip mall on East Charleston. Now, you may want to reconsider actually going into this place, but my husband and I did on a Saturday afternoon as we were headed home from shopping.\u000a\u000aMe: "Look, that kid has a pizza. Pizza sounds good." (Kid was walking down the street with a pizza box)\u000aHusband: "I bet he got it from that pizza place right there."\u000aMe: "You want to get pizza? I'm hungry."\u000aHusband: "Okay." (Pulls into shady strip mall)\u000a\u000aWELL, basically that's how it went. We entered this tiny storefront, which has two small tables, and a tiny bar area. This place is obviously mainly for pick-up or delivery. \u000a\u000aWe ordered a medium one-topping ($5.99). They charge a .50 cent fee for running a debit or credit card by the way.\u000a\u000aAs for the pizza - it reminded me of Chuck E Cheese pizza. They use the really stringy cheese, so when you pull away from the pizza you get that seriously cartoonish looking style of eating pizza a la Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The sauce is obviously from some cans and I can guarantee you none of this stuff is fresh. But for $5.99 what do you expect? \u000a\u000aIt's OK. Would I go out of my way to eat here again? No. But was it good for an unexpected splurge? Yes.

VFirst off, I am not an "out-doorsy" person. I really have no reason to be in an REI. Most of this stuff just looks weird to me. Sure I can see bicycles, tents, and other camping paraphernalia, but honestly I just don't have much interest in this kind of stuff. With that being said, I DO have friends and a boyfriend who are avid about camping and hiking and running, etc.\u000a\u000aI like this location because it is nicely located at The District one of my favorite shopping centers. Every time I have been in here it has been clean and organized. And even I have not had a problem finding certain things. \u000a\u000aI've been here to buy camping pots/pans for a friend's wedding gift. I was pleasantly surprised to find a set made in the USA - and for a reasonable price too! I have also been here to purchase a gift certificate for my boyfriend. The cashier was so nice, she even asked if I was buying it for someone who had a membership. I wasn't sure, so she looked my boyfriend's name up and he did indeed have a membership! So she linked the gift certificate to his account! So now if he happens to lose the card he will still be able to use the money with just his account number!\u000a\u000aOverall this is a wonderful place with very nice, helpful employees. If I ever find myself needing something for camping or what not I am sure REI will be the first place I think to go.

VI know, it's Jack in the Box. But, I do, on occasion stop by this particular Jack in the Box on my way home from work. Sure, it's fast food, but when I need a meal and I'm feeling particularly mayonnaise-y Jack in the Box is the answer. I've never been in the actual dining area. I have only ever been through the drive-thru.\u000a\u000aThe reason for 4 stars is because of the quickness and ALWAYS happy drive-thru order takers. I am not sure what this Jack in the Box is doing that is making their employees so happy, but they're doing something right.\u000a\u000aOverall - food, is fast food. You know, it's okay and it's there and it's cheap. But service is fantastic.

VI am as much of fan as Francesca's as you can get. Whenever I go to The District I make it a priority to pop in here and check out the new merchandise. I love how eclectic it feels in here, yet everything seems well taken care of. You can tell the owner and the employees take a real pride in the place.\u000a\u000aNumerous items have been bought here for myself and for friends and family. I love their charms, jewelery, bags, and fun items. There's really something for everyone. I usually go here to find those "fun" items I'll drop into a friend's birthday present. Last time I was here I got my friend a wine stopper and rubber duck tea infuser. I also bought myself a purse hook. I've been meaning to purchase one for awhile and the glitzy jeweled ones here really caught my eye.\u000a\u000aOn top of all this they do have sales every once and awhile. You'll see them put their on-sale clothes out on racks. I've never bought clothes here, but that's probably because I'm just attracted to all the nick nacks.

VHotbox Salon has become my go-to for my hair. I bounced around a lot from salon to salon, until now! I originally came here because I got a Groupon for a special cut and deep-conditioning. I had my appointment with Toni and she is amazing. She knows hair very well, especially my wavy/curly locks that tend to distress other hairdressers. But she was not phased.\u000a\u000aRecently I went back for a simple color, nothing crazy, just sticking to my natural brown, just a bit darker, but mostly to cover my greys. Toni was very accomodating and came in early on a Friday morning to make sure I could get my hair done with plenty of time before I had to be at work at 11:30 AM.\u000a\u000aThe salon serves up water AND coffee in the mornings. I was treated to a nice cup of joe while getting my hair done.\u000a\u000aAlso of note, the salon is very clean and I love the ambiance - the Craftsman toolboxes where the hair dressers keep their stuff is awesome. I've also always had a good repertoire with the receptionist here as well. \u000a\u000aI will be returning here, of course, for everything that has to do with my hair.

VLet's start with the staff here on the afternoon I dropped in:\u000a\u000aInattentive, lazy teenagers whose main concern was to talk to their friends who, yes, did happen to be placing orders. However, that does not give anyone working in a position such as theirs the ability to ignore TWO other customers waiting in line to order. Because the employees here decided it was more important to talk to their friends, I waited 10 minutes just to place my order.\u000a\u000aAfter placing my order I then proceeded to wait for another 10 minutes as drink after drink came out before mine. I left with my drink as soon as I got it. I can't even say I liked the boba tea. It was okay, I guess. But I suppose I was just soured from the whole experience, I couldn't even enjoy my drink.\u000a\u000aI think this place must be good. Everyone on Yelp raves about it. But my experience was bad. No more Easy Life boba for me.

VIn the midst of the ghetto and streetwalkers on Boulder Highway there is a Pizza Hut. My husband wanted to go. He wanted pizza. OK.\u000a\u000aStrangely enough the inside of the establishment looks new and polished, not run down. The front counter is clean and organized. The staff was friendly.\u000a\u000aWhat I didn't like - although you can eat in this is primarily a pick-up/delivery place. The dining  area is small AND there is no pizza buffet! *gasp* That is what I always think of when I think of actually going to Pizza Hut to eat - the buffet! No buffet here.\u000a\u000aThe tables had no red pepper flakes or Parmesan cheese to sprinkle on the pizzas. Not even one of them. When I looked around to see if it was just the table we sat at I was baffled to see not one of the tables had condiments on them. Strange.\u000a\u000aAnyway, it's an okay place to get a pizza, especially considering the location. As for food - sure, it's Pizza Hut pizza, it's hard to mess up. It's the same consistency, etc. It came out piping hot, so that was good, but we were one of three tables in the whole place. Kind of hard to mess up.

VPanera Bread, although a tad overpriced in my opinion, is a decent place to a grab a quick bite to eat. I am not going to say they are a healthy option compared to other "fast" type eateries because I don't think everything on their menu is really promoting great health. However, it is a step up from a burger and fries combo at McDonald's. \u000a\u000aThis Panera is a staple of The District, sits directly facing the parking lot and is conveniently located. The establishment is large and spacious, which is good, because anytime I have been here the place has been steady with patrons. Customer service is good, although I always get hit up to get their card, which I decline, because I don't go to Panera enough to warrant getting the card. Plus, all in all I am kind of fed up with this every freakin' place I go wants to give me some card deal. Hrumph. Anyway.\u000a\u000aFood - I ordered the Chipotle Panini and my husband ordered the Smokehouse Trukey Panini. Both came out deliciously melty and warm, pressed perfectly. I received mine with chips, my husband got a cut up apple, so we shared. Overall loved the paninis. We also ordered a yummy blueberry muffin which was dense and flavorful. \u000a\u000aQuality vs. price - Again, as stated above I feel Panera to be overpriced. I got two combo paninis (which do not come with a drink), one small drink, and a muffin, my total came to almost 20 bucks. The paninis are on the smaller side, so the price value does not exactly match the quality and quantity of what you are receiving. However, the taste is good.\u000a\u000aSo you have to fight your battles with fast, convenient, "healthier" food. Of course I will return to Panera Bread in the future. I just wish it did not hurt my wallet so bad.

VMy trips to Williams-Sonoma will never cease. I heart this place and all of the kitchen gadgets it provides me with to oogle at. I actually do purchase things here, but typically I browse, come back, browse again, and then make a hard decision. Mostly because this stuff ain't cheap.\u000a\u000aFor me W&S is a place to let my inner chef come out and just daydream about the day I WILL OWN THAT EXPENSIVE SPATULA SET.... ahem. As I was saying...\u000a\u000aI do like that W&S has a wide range of baking accessories and offers Star Wars cookie cutters, pancake molds, etc. Also they have a decent selection of pots and pans. \u000a\u000aThe staff here is usually nice. I have run into the same older women a few times and they are always quick to have a conversation with me. Last time I was here there was kind of an odd guy running the cash register. He wasn't mean, just a little off. I felt awkward just taking my bag and walking away without any conversation or "goodbye".\u000a\u000aAnyway, someday I will go to W&S and have my way... until then, daydreams it is.

VI ventured to The Body Shop specifically for a rose oil hand treatment that was reccomened to me by a co-worker as the skin under my wedding band and engagement ring has become agitated lately. \u000a\u000aUnfortunately this Body Shop is located in the Boulevard Mall, but fortunately for me it is not far from my house. And luckily - the store front is very close to a main entrance so I do have to wander too far into the mall to get here.\u000a\u000aI don't come here very often because I find their lotions and products to be overly pricey. I can usually go to Sephora and find equivalents that are cheaper. But since I was going for a specific thing, my trip was palatable. \u000a\u000aI quickly found what I was looking for and then was rung up by a nice enough employee. Of course, she asked me if I had their silly member card to which I replied no. In actuality I used to have it, but it expires after a year of not being in use - so what's the point anyway? These loyalty cards are becoming increasingly annoying to me.\u000a\u000aOverall the shop was clean, the service was fine, and I found what I needed.

VI've long looked over L&L as an option for eating in my part of the hood. Yes, this L&L happens to be off of Valley View and Nellis Blvd. I decided to pop in there today as I was running errands and because I am on a tight budget right now, I just didn't have it in me to drive myself anywhere else in the valley.\u000a\u000aLet's start off with the pro's:\u000a\u000aThe restaurant is very clean, tables and seating look new or if not, very well taken care of. The service was impeccable, incredibly nice, happy, and genuine. The food came out relatively quickly.\u000a\u000aWhat I ordered:\u000a\u000aCurry Chicken Katsu Bowl: Meh. The bowl was almost over halfway filled with rice, very little curry sauce. It could have used A LOT more curry sauce. The veggies were pretty obviously of the frozen variety, topped with those carrots that have the weird ridges on them... I don't know what the appeal of having carrots like that is. I'd rather my food just look like what it is supposed to look like.... no some weird machine-manufactured vegetable. The chicken, although moist, was kind of bready, and not in a good way. \u000a\u000aSpam Musubi: Yum! I really liked it. Perfectly and tightly wrapped, plus just enough sauce and salty spam. I would order this again.\u000a\u000aOverall... I like Aloha Kitchen over L&L and AK is closer to my house. I don't think I would completely take this L&L off my list, but it's not high up either. If I go back, maybe I should try the BBQ.... hmm.

VI've been to Hennessey's on a number of occasions. More often than not I go here to simply drink and that's about it. I have never been here when they have had live bands, but I would like to go. I have heard they often cover some good Irish punk rock stuff (Dropkick Murphys, The Pogues, etc.)\u000a\u000aI have never sat at a table, so I cannot comment on their servers. I've always headed straight for the bar, even if I was planning to eat. Whenever I have been I have had an easy time finding a spot at the bar and I've never had an issue getting a bartender to come quickly up to me in an acceptable amount of time. Last time I was in here was for the "start" of my birthday downtown. I ordered a Jameson & Ginger, and thus the whiskey started flowing. After two J&G's I had a straight shot of Jameson. The bartender then realized it was my birthday and poured me a second (very heavy) FREE shot. So I was introduced to their Jameson Century Club. Have 100 shots of Jameson and you get your name on a plaque on the wall (and a bottle of Jameson). I now have 6 stamps on my card. Guess I'll be back for more!\u000a\u000aI'm biased because I like Irish pubs right off the bat. I'm Irish and I love whiskey. I like Irish things and Irish songs and well... you get the idea. The fact that Hennessey's is downtown is also a plus. \u000a\u000aThe food I think is simply bar food. There is nothing great or spectacular about it. From recent memory I have had their buffalo style chicken tenders (okee dokee, nothing fantastic) and I've had their French Dip (I think it's called something else though), but that sandwich was very tasty.\u000a\u000aAll in all, love Hennessey's. Will always go back.

VHurray for Hennessey's! I just love this place. It's always a great start to an evening of fun on Fremont East. I hit it up last night because they are offering 50% off appetizers if you check in on Yelp on your phone. Sweet deal, right?\u000a\u000aI got the Irish Nachos. Yum! I liked them. They're thinly sliced potatoes (not potato chips), covered in cheese, green onions, and bacon, plus a very generous dollop of sour cream. I was craving Irish Nachos so bad so this was a nice little calorie-fest for me. Believe me, these things are not healthy!\u000a\u000aThe bartenders here are awesome and they take the time to remember people who show up to the bar regularly. Bartender also recommended to me a very tasty beer - Boddington's. It's a creamy English beer that is very smooth and very different. Also knocked another Jameson off my card - so one more shot closer to my own plaque on the wall! ;)\u000a\u000aOh, and my reviews are based off of eating AT THE BAR. Just want to make that clear. I've never sat in the restaurant part of this place.

VOh dear, I certainly hope my next visit to Hennessey's will be bumped up to the normal 4-Star Rating I expect. \u000a\u000aI went to HT last night to partake of their 2-4-1 burger night (it's on Tuesdays). *sigh* I was disappointed. First off I ordered the Normal run-o-the-mill burger while my friend ordered one of the corn-beef hash burgers. My burger was NOT GOOD. I ordered it medium well, it came out WELL DONE, like super well done. Who wants to eat a dried up, over cooked burger? Not me. I asked for the Irish cheese, well when the burger came out the cheese was practically non-existent and it was just seared into the burger. I suspect a chef was not paying attention to this burger and just let it cook forever. I suspect this especially because it took quite awhile for our food to come out and the place was NOT busy. \u000a\u000aAnother complaint: the burger came with ONE measly lettuce leaf and ONE slice of thin tomato! Well I guess they're trying to save money on the burgers because they're doing a 2-4-1 special? Guess what Hennessey's? It's not cool to offer a special deal and then skimp on the burger and turn it into a piece-o-crap that no one wants to eat! \u000a\u000aIt is a good thing I got the Truffle Fries as an appetizer with the 50% off deal you can get by checking in on Yelp, otherwise I would have been really unhappy. But even the truffle fries were not my favorite as they were just covered in garlic. However, I enjoyed them over the burger.\u000a\u000aThe bartender here was nice and congenial, but the food ruined it for me. I will be back, but not for burger night and I definitely will not be ordering a burger from here ever again. Burger blacklisted!

VThese tacos are very satisfying after a night of drinking, not gonna lie. If you're downtown having a good time and you want something to fill that void then Pepe's Tacos just might do it for you.\u000a\u000aOn recommendation from my friend who brought me here I ordered the carne asada tacos (2) and got an order of fries (ay! very gringo of me! so said my friend). Oh well, I can't help it if I'm white and I like fries!\u000a\u000aGlad my friend suggested the carne asada tacos, they were bursting with meat and were very flavorful. Got a few different salsas and slathered these little suckers with salsa and lime. Oh man, they were tasty. You're gonna want to get more than one that's for sure. The fries were pretty dang good too. They put some kind of spice on them that gives them a real good kick. You're gonna like it if you like different tastes. I definitely suggest getting an order of fries with whatever you get here.\u000a\u000aYa, the location is a tad ghetto (doesn't bother me), but the place was clean and there was a lot of families in here when we showed up (kinda late actually). \u000a\u000aIt's a good little place to get some bomb tacos in my opinion.

VTa Ta is great although I have not been in awhile because it is not around where I live. \u000a\u000aThey do teppanyaki style and sushi, so yes, it is a fusion type restaurant. I have only had their sushi though and it has always been fresh and consistent. Never have I had a disappointing roll here.\u000a\u000aThe staff is great. Management tends to walk the tables and ask how your meal is going and if everything is good. \u000a\u000aCan get a little loud if the teppanyaki tables are going and show is happening, but that should be expected in this type of place. \u000a\u000aOverall, great sushi place in the Henderson area.

VI've been to this Jo-Ann's a lot over the past couple months because I have a brand new sewing machine and I am learning to sew. \u000a\u000aThe store is always clean, never messy. All things are in their respective places. There is a lot of fabric to choose from, and other crafty items. Their patterns books are always out and there is table you can sit and flip through them. The drawers for the patterns are well kept and not messy.\u000a\u000aEven on busy Sundays they have enough people cutting fabric so as to make sure your wait is not very long. And the people cutting fabric do a good job. I've never waited over 10 minutes to have my fabric cut.\u000a\u000aAlso, sometimes they have very good deals on fabric, so you can stock up if you are a sewer or someone who makes your own clothes, etc.\u000a\u000aI have never had a problem shopping here and they will continue to get my business.

VIn essence...\u000a\u000aNo AYCE. Overpriced because it is so close to the Strip. $60+ with tip for 2 people.\u000a\u000aMy husband and I managed to land here for sushi on a Friday night. We did this because the line for Yama Sushi (which is my fave sushi spot in town) had a line waaaay out the door and to be honest I just did not want to wait that long. So. Enter Kaizen, which had good Yelp reviews, but alas, was somewhat of a disappointment. \u000a\u000aFirst with the good, the place LOOKS fabulous. Dark exterior, plays with lovely lighting and the tables are large with good spacing. Dinnerware and presentation is superb, but it better be since this place is so close to the Strip. Customer service is so-so. Although the entire staff yells as people enters/leaves, our service with food to our table was only okay. I ordered a hot green tea and it was brought out in a large cup, which I dislike because I enjoy my tea HOT. As it sits uncovered it cools down quickly and not once did a server ask to refill it. I prefer smaller cups and pots of tea for this reason.\u000a\u000aOrdered:\u000a\u000a- Edamame \u000a- California Roll\u000a- Tuna Roll \u000a- Shrimp Roll\u000a- Spicy Rainbow Roll\u000a- Spicy Tuna Hand Roll\u000a\u000aPluses - size of rolls at least (kind of) make you not feel so bad about how much you are paying and that you cannot get AYCE here. PLUS, again, presentation is great and sushi is very good quality. The only qualm I had was with the Tuna Roll being a bit on the warmer side when it arrived at our table than I would have liked.\u000a\u000aMy husband is a super picky sushi eater (hence the very plain rolls we had). The place does have some interesting rolls, the spicy rainbow roll was decent, and large, I'm glad I ordered it as it did fill me up.\u000a\u000aBEST - Edamame, just stinking amazing for some reason. Served steaming, with a good amount of salt, and a LARGE portion.\u000a\u000aNot the best... again, price wise you can find just as good sushi elsewhere and Vegas, except you don't have to pay for the atmosphere and Jay-Z music videos in the background.... HOLY GRAIL!!!

VI've had good Thai food. I've even had really good Thai food. I've also had mediocre Thai food. And... I've had Thai food delivered to my house, which... is kind of the most awesome Thai food of all, right? Well anyway, Archi's lands in the middle for me. I declare it to be good, okay, not amazing. \u000a\u000aMy friend and I went during a very busy lunch hour today. When we arrived the doorway was packed and as we walked in we walked into... well, people. I felt a little awkward and I wasn't sure if these people were in line or what. After about a good minute of standing there a girl slid by my friend and I and gave her name to the man at the counter to the right who didn't acknowledge anyone coming into the place. Hrmm. I headed over and gave him my name. He wrote it down. That was it. No salutations. No telling me how long the wait would be. Oooo-kay. Moving on...\u000a\u000aWe were sat in about 10 minutes (would have been nice to have known the wait time...). Our waitress arrived quickly and we were already ready to order because we were ordering off of the lunch special menu. I ordered the pad thai with chicken at a spiciness level of 7 and I ordered a Thai iced tea. My friend ordered the red curry with tofu at a spiciness level of 9 and we waited.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant is small and somewhat loud, but not so loud you can't hold a conversation. The tables were clean and the place looks new and polished. \u000a\u000aAs for the food. My friend and I both declared it to be pretty good, but nothing amazing. My pad thai was okay - but the noodles were a bit dry and clumped together. The side of soup was actually quite good and had an interesting flavor, coupled with the mushrooms, which I found to be a great addition. The egg roll fell flat with me, it was basically an egg roll - nothing more. My friend had just about the same reaction with her red curry. It was all right. \u000a\u000aWe ordered two very basic Thai dishes. These are base lines for what the rest of the menu will be like. Hmmm. I can't say Archi's is good enough for me to return to - especially during the busy lunch hour. The strange way the host was handling people as they came in the door was a BIG turn off for me as well. \u000a\u000aArchi's gets an okay from me for now.

VAfter a movie at Green Valley Ranch I was feeling like I needed to eat. Out with my friend who frequents The District, she suggested Rachel's Kitchen. It was night (when The District is a bit less chaotic) and on top of that the weather was not very nice for people to be out and about in an outdoor shopping promenade. So, when we entered Rachel's there was few people to be found and those that were there dispersed and we enjoyed our meal all by ourselves. I have seen Rachel's Kitchen a lot more packed, so this is obviously not a testament to their popularity, just the situation in which I went there.\u000a\u000aI got the turkey avocado sandwich. It was pretty good. The bread was toasted just right and the cheese and chicken were in perfect amounts. I hate it when I get sandwiches where the meat is just completely overtaking the sandwich. Rachel's knows how to correctly make a sandwich. However - one complaint is that I wish there had been a BIT more avocado. I mean, I LOVE avocado and if it is on a menu then I'm definitely going to order it. \u000a\u000aI can see Rachel's being really popular during the day with really nice weather. The outside seating makes up for the fact that the inside is a teeny bit too small. If the place had been packed I could imagine it would be kind of irritating to be in such a small place with so many people. But, with weather permitting I would definitely take a seat outside.\u000a\u000aWhy doesn't Rachel's get 5 Stars? It's in The District. I do enjoy The District, but often I find it kind of pretentious. Snooty Summerlin families with teacup dogs and little kids running around just are not my cup of tea. But Rachel's knows what they're doing. I hope to make a return trip to try their breakfast in the near future!

VMy return visit to Rachel's Kitchen! I arrived just around 11:20 AM on a Saturday morning and the place was bustling, although not overly packed. The outside dining area had pretty much every table full of Summerlin moms and a scattering of elderly people and young people enjoying brunch or just coffee outside in the nice weather. I believe Rachel's Kitchen attracts quite a wide range of people.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Breakfast Burrito and asked for bacon to be put it in it. The service was very nice and the cashier was pleasant. I quickly retreated outside to find a place to sit and found a partially-shaded table that was perfect. \u000a\u000aThe food came out quick. I thought the burrito was very generous with its fillings. There was a lot of eggs, very well cooked, and a good amount of bacon. The pico de gallo inside was not over-powering (especially for someone like me, who HATES cilantro). However, my same complaint as before - I saw avocado on the ingredients list and I was over-joyed with happiness - BUT the burrito was somewhat lacking in my expectation of avocado goodness. Perhaps I have learned my lesson and will order EXTRA avocado from here on out. The burrito also came with little potatoes and ketchup to dip them in. I only had a few, because the burrito was very large, in fact - I didn't finish it!\u000a\u000aRachel's Kitchen is great for an outdoor brunch. I do like it, but again it is in The District and if you can deal with a little bit of the snooty customers who inhabit this particular shopping center, than you will be fine. I will only subject myself to it when I truly need to go out of my way - as is the case with grabbing a bite to eat at Rachel's Kitchen.

VIt's official. Rachel's is officially a 5-Star place for me. I've been here now on three occasions and although my reviews before this one were not 5-Stars, I gotta push them up to the 5-Star mark.\u000a\u000aToday I had the turkey and avocado sandwich with a side salad and a cup of water. The people working here are genuinely nice and professional at the same time. You can tell they all enjoy working here and are happy to put a lot of work into really good food.\u000a\u000aThe side salad is perfect in my opinion. Greens are crispy, dressing is perfectly portioned and tangy, AND they serve their salads wish sliced radishes! Who does that?! I hardly ever see anyone put radishes on salads! The sandwich was yummy too.\u000a\u000aMenu is awesome and offers something for everyone. I will say I think it is a bit on the pricey side, BUT you are in The District. \u000a\u000aHonestly I just love Rachel's Kitchen and the next time I go I am trying one of the salads or the pastas!

VAll I have to say is: What the heck Las Vegas?\u000a\u000aCashman Field is an okay place to catch a ball game. I highly recommended throwing down the very few extra dollars it will cost you to sit behind home plate. Unless of course you're really wanting to catch those foul balls. But seriously, 2 bucks for a decent seat instead of a bench is worth it.\u000a\u000aBut really Las Vegas? We can't upgrade our baseball stadium? It's just a bit bigger than a high school baseball stadium. Sure, it's okay, but why can't we do a little better? Las Vegas is a huge city - it deserves a better ballpark.\u000a\u000aOverall this is a good time. You must endure the families and the kiddies, but hey, it's a baseball game, so you have no choice. \u000a\u000aFood choices are meh and of course the prices are outrageous for what you're getting, but again, I digress - baseball game!\u000a\u000aFun times though and I enjoyed myself. I would be afraid to go when it starts hitting those 90+ temperatures though.

VWow, bowling has been taken up a notch.\u000a\u000aBeware normal bowling fans, Red Rock Lanes will be a completely different experience for you, especially if you go for the Cosmic Bowling nights. This is bowling at a club. You will not find anyone over the age of 40 bowling here during cosmic bowling, that's for sure.\u000a\u000aI celebrated my "early" birthday here with a gathering of friends. We got a lane for two games. Each game costs $13 (that includes shoes). Well, that's a bit pricey in my book for bowling, BUT it was my birthday so splurge! In all honesty I would probably bowl elsewhere (for cheaper) had it not been my birthday party. The ambiance is hip, there's a plus with a really nice bar, and the music is fun - but really, when you go to bowl isn't it more about BOWLING and talking with friends/making fun of their poor bowling skills? This is kind of a hard thing to do when you have strobe lights in your face and a booming background track of music.\u000a\u000aIt's a HUGE facility and even on a Saturday night around 9 PM we did not have to wait for a lane. I think with other places you'd probably end up waiting around a bit for a lane to open up just because other alleys are much smaller. \u000a\u000aThere's a multitude of pluses about this place, but I think the real downside is the expensive price tag they put on it. Bowling should be for the masses and should be cheap! Of course, that's just my opinion. Overall, good time, but I think maybe I'll just go to the base and pay $5 for unlimited cosmic bowling....

VIs this the only Zaba's in Las Vegas? If it is, I am lucky enough to have it located on my side of town. In fact, besides the Chipotle in the UNLV area, this is the closest place I can go to get a nice, big, yum-tastic burrito.\u000a\u000aMainly I go to Zaba's for chicken burritos. I rarely deviate. It's the same with Chipotle and Qdoba. What can I say? I guess I am a creature of habit. But how can I not be when the delicious chicken, rice, beans, salsa, cheese, and sour cream are all delightfully wrapped up in an easy to handle and nom on burrito?\u000a\u000aZaba's is slightly different from other similar Mexican chains. I do believe they are locally owned (sorry if I'm mistaken in that). They also offer wheat tortillas (for no extra charge). I've never had a problem with service at this location. It's quick, efficient and for the most part the staff is friendly. \u000a\u000aStill, my favorite burrito-go-to is Qdoba. However, Zaba's IS good and its location so close to me makes it a favorite spot of mine.

VI've been to BPS many times. Typically I am dragged here by my husband so he can ogle boats and other outdoor accessories. Yesterday we went because he wanted to look at boats. We went directly to the area and began checking them out. Not once did an employee appear to help us. In fact, there were no employees in sight the entire time we searched over the boats. My husband actually really wanted to inquire about a small, plastic fishing boat so we had to search around for an employee.\u000a\u000aWe found two men working by where the really expensive reels are located for fishing and we stood in front of their counter, obviously needing help. One of the men was talking with another customer, but the other (younger one) was doing nothing. I even made eye contact with him and he just stood there instead of helping us. So we walked elsewhere. When we came around a corner I saw FOUR, yes, FOUR BPS employees just standing around in a circle talking. I went over to them and said, "Excuse me" and finally one of them asked if he could help us. GEE, THANKS? Yes, I would like some help.\u000a\u000aOne of the older gentleman then pawned off one of the younger men to help us. "For the next 12 minutes, since it's almost time to go home!". \u000a\u000aI guess BPS values the need of their employees to stand around and do nothing for a half an hour before quitting time, than they do actually helping customers. \u000a\u000aWhile the store itself is massive and impressive, the items are WAY overpriced. You could get a majority of this stuff at smaller sportsman stores or online even for way cheaper. And, the customer service sucks.

VFiremen - yum.\u000a\u000aSandwiches - also yum!\u000a\u000aHey, how can I not like a place that is owned and operated by firemen? Considering my obsession with Rescue Me, I'd say that's pretty much impossible. \u000a\u000aOn my birthday (May 1st) I decided I would try out Firehouse Subs. Because guess what? You can get a free medium sub on your birthday here - your choice of which kind of sandwich! I decided to do this on my birthday because FS is a bit out of the way for me to drive to, but it's been on my "To Try" list for awhile. Now I wish there was one right up the block from where I live. It's so frustrating to be faced with ONE sandwich option in my neighborhood: Subway. Boo.\u000a\u000aAs for Firehouse - they have now been moved into my top sandwich spots! I personally think they are better than Cap's and the setup of the shop is nicer than Cap's as well. I think the "firehouse" decor adds to the experience and of course, the multitude of hot sauces to sprinkle on your sandwiches kicks everything up a notch! Excuse my Emeril euphemism. \u000a\u000aOn my trip I got the Hook & Ladder: ham, turkey, melty cheese, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and this nice deli sauce mustard - mmm! Without the mustard it's just an ordinary sandwich, but with it - oh my... \u000a\u000aThe staff was nice and happy about my birthday sub (yay!) and I really love their Coca Cola machine. It's like the new ones inside Five Guys burger places.\u000a\u000aOverall - 4 Stars! Not 5 because I do think it's a bit pricey.

VJust went to First Friday for my first time this past Friday. I'd never been before, because I don't think going to the revelry that happens after 10 PM on Fremont East really counts. I have done that - but this was my first time in the arts district part of the party.\u000a\u000aSomehow I found a parking space, not sure how I pulled it off, but I parked in a dirt lot where a bunch of other cars were chilling. I did get there kind of late (about 9 PM) so I'm guessing some people had already left and in turn left empty spots. \u000a\u000aHit up Downtown Vintage Guitars first to listen to a guy doing some beat boxing - interesting. Then headed down to the Gypsy Den and took a look the booths set up with people selling their art and other things. Don't get me wrong, I have an appreciation for art, but I don't like it enough to really get into it. Plus I'm definitely not going to buy anything, but that's just me.\u000a\u000aMy friend and I heard some sounds of a band wafting toward us so we grabbed a couple drinks and then listened to the band that was set up on the street. We only caught the last couple songs which was kind of disappointing, but ah well. At this point my friend and I just took a seat on the sidewalk curb and people watched.\u000a\u000aOverall I did like the live music. I'd like to go back and concentrate on just seeing the live music. However, the art really doesn't matter that much to me so it was pretty much overlooked. As for the crowd and the feel of the whole event, I was struck dumb by how many underage kids were there. I think some of them had to be in middle school. That was kind of weird for me.\u000a\u000aI can't help but compare this to Sparks Farmers Market which happens in Reno, Nevada where I went to college. Except the Farmers Market was much more contained and on a really, really nice street that was always set up nicely and was easy to navigate. Plus the Farmers Market was on a street with a lot of awesome pubs and places to eat. \u000a\u000aI think Vegas could really fine tune First Friday into a sweet event. Just gotta keep it up and keep improving it.\u000a\u000aAnd as a final note - I was really surprised by the amount of Metro presence. I mean I understand the need for security, but so many Metro officers? Too much police makes people feel uncomfortable. I would be the last person to say anything bad about a police officer, but there's a fine line you must walk when running an event. Couple police officers - okee dokee. Multiple police officers who look like they are there and on the verge of peppering the crowd with rubber bullets? Not good.

VHonestly this is my favorite mall in Las Vegas. Perhaps it is not as glammy as the Fashion Show, but the FS is on the Strip, which is a place I try to avoid most of the time. Although it's in Henderson I would much rather go out of my way to drive here than to go to the mall that is closest to me (Boulevard). Plus, this mall has great stores and restaurants around it as well.\u000a\u000aI think it offers a good variety of stores. I particularly like the Victoria Secret here and Dick's Sporting Goods. \u000a\u000aGenerally this mall is full of families, and often teenagers. Really you're never going to get away from the groups of teenagers at malls - it's just a fact of life. \u000a\u000aIt's clean, efficient and has a decent food court as well. Even has a yogurt place and hey, there's a McDonalds! \u000a\u000aA big plus is - there's hardly any tourists, so you're shopping amongst locals for the most part and that is nice. \u000a\u000aOne downside - you aren't going to find any high end stores here. But there's always the Fashion Show for that.

VThis is why I am a fan of Circle Bar at Hard Rock:\u000a\u000aPeople. Watching. \u000a\u000aOkay so you can people watch anywhere really, but Hard Rock is one of the best places to do so. I don't know what it is about Hard Rock, but it attracts some really ridiculous people. I'm talking really drugged-out or just plain old stupid drunk Las Vegas tourists. If you don't have anything better to do on a Friday or a Saturday night plopping down at Circle Bar and enjoying the circus parade through to different night clubs, etc. through the Hard Rock is hilarious and fun.\u000a\u000aAlso, I've been here on more occasions than other casino bars because I frequent The Joint for concerts. So, going to Circle Bar beforehand is always a nice precursor to the evening, or even going there for post-drinks. \u000a\u000aPrices are typical Las Vegas casino prices. Don't expect to go here on the cheap or anything. \u000a\u000aAlso - Circle Bar and Hard Rock itself are better for me being a tattooed girl. At Hard Rock if I wear a sleeveless dress I won't get the weird stares at my large tattoo I have on my right arm. And more often than not I'll get compliments about it over anything else.

VWhat? Go to a swapmeet? Nah. But I did.\u000a\u000aFantastic has been around for awhile in Vegas. It is what it is. Some people shop here faithfully, some come every once and awhile. I came for a work function and stayed to shop around a bit.\u000a\u000aSome think swapmeets are skeezy, but this one is nice. It is indoors, the vendors are set up in a grid system. There is a Farmer's Market!! Yes, inside the swapmeet is a farmer's market. I was pleasantly surprised by this.\u000a\u000aCurrently the swapmeet is open Thurs, Fri, Sat, Sun. But they are planning to open 7 days a week for specific sections. So get ready for deals every day of the week.\u000a\u000aThere are also food vendors, but I did not try any. There are a lot of places to bling out your i-Phone, buy knock-off items (no thanks), but also some vendors with quite intriguing items. \u000a\u000aDon't knock it til you've tried it! ;)

VI love Target stores in general, some are better than others. This one is on the better end. I can chalk it up to a few key elements as to why this Target tickles my fancy over others.\u000a\u000aCleanliness and organized. I've never come to this Target and seen many things out of place, nor does it have a run-down feeling. It's fairly new and spacious. The addition of a small grocery section is a big plus.\u000a\u000aTarget-specific branded food items can be found here and I am always on the hunt for new, healthy food. The organics line of snack products are perfect ways to satiate my snacking habits, without me getting into trouble. The Archer Farms brand in particular has great food.\u000a\u000aProducts here are plentiful and in stock. On my recent trip I went to look for sleepwear/lounging pants and found an array of materials and patterns with ranging prices. It's nice to have a wide selection.\u000a\u000aOverall I can't complain about any of my visits here so this Target gets 5 Stars.

VSpoiled by Scandia.\u000a\u000aWhat can I say? There just aren't any great mini-golf places anymore in Las Vegas. Scandia was so awesome, and now we have King Putt. My boyfriend and I made this a late date night as they are open till 1 AM on Fridays and Saturdays. We arrived and did not have to wait to start our journey through the neon blackness.\u000a\u000aSome of the holes were fun, but others were kinda boring. All in all it seriously just fell flat as a "fun" date experience. I suppose this would be a great place to take those really little kids who have absolutely no idea what they're doing. Then the pleasure would be watching THEM have fun.\u000a\u000aI did happen to get the "hole in one" on the last hole, so I got a card and some stamps that will lead up to a free game. Buuutttt honestly I doubt I'll ever be back to use it! Oh by the way, they offer a military discount, but UM... only for the person with the military ID! My boyfriend's price was discounted, but not mine. Errr, okay.. don't know why it was not totally comped since he paid for both of our rounds. *shrug* Just one of those weird things I guess.

VWow. Wow. Wow.\u000a\u000aI am impressed by Earl of Sandwich. I have had a friend of mine from college in town for a couple days and last night he really wanted to do the whole "walk the strip" thing. After meandering all up and down the strip we were in dire need of food and I had heard of Earl of Sandwich and knew it was open 24 hours so we headed there in a hunger haze.\u000a\u000aWe arrived around 2:30 AM and there was a small line. The place looked as popular as I had heard. The line does go quickly and they give you buzzers to take to a table and wait for your food to be ready. The cashier last night sounded super tired and kind of annoyed, but I can't be too hard on her for that - it was 2 in the morning.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Club (turkey, bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato). My friend got the Montagu, a cup of broccoli and cheese soup, and we shared a brownie. \u000a\u000aMy sandwich was super tasty, warm, the bread was yummy. There was just enough turkey in it to make it good, but not overloaded. I hate it when I get a sandwich and the contents are spilling out of it. But this one was a perfect combination of all the ingredients. I think my only issue was that it was very salty compared to other sandwiches I have eaten. My friend said the soup was good and it was hot when he got it - so that's a plus!\u000a\u000aWhen we finished eating the line had gotten even longer than when we had arrived and it was definitely after 3 AM. This place is great for drunken snacks after being out drinking all night. I don't know how convenient the location is, but if I really had a hankering for one of their sandwiches again I don't think it would deter me from heading down to Planet Hollywood. \u000a\u000aHot sandwiches - YUM!

VI never got turned on to stand-up comedy until I met my current boyfriend, who really loves it. Over the past year I've been to the Four Queens Comedy Club four times and every time I was not disappointed.\u000a\u000aThe comedians for the most part are funny. However, for some reason they always seem to have a host who is well, not funny. Great thing - you can get a wristband that gets you free drinks during the show. And there are waitresses who come around to serve you, so no need to get up and get your drinks.\u000a\u000aThey also have an excellent military discount. Overall, a fun time, and something totally different to do if you're downtown and in need of something to distract you from just drinking at the bars.

VBoca Park can be a destination for some great shopping, eating, or simply window shopping. The center hosts a multitude of different shops and eateries. I could name them all off, but I'll stick with a few I tend to frequent more often than others. \u000a\u000aAs for sitting back and relaxing with a tasty beverage, you can do so at Samballate, a wonderful cafe. The center boasts two liquor stores - Total Wine and Lee's. My most frequented store - Target, it a nice size and includes a grocery section. Restaurants are plentiful too and my favorite here is The Cheesecake Factory.\u000a\u000aBut the center has specialty stores as well - such as REI, a place where I tend to go with my husband. \u000a\u000aOverall this center is certainly one of the best in Vegas. Perhaps the only thing it is missing is a Patty's Cloest, or more locally owned restaurants or even a bakery. It's for that reason only I am dinging one star.

VMy final stop for Restaurant Week 2011 landed me at Payard. I was happy to be finishing up with a modern French bistro menu as I rarely go out of my way to seek out good French food for day-to-day eatings. \u000a\u000aMy friend and I arrived right around 12:30 after having scoured Caeser's Palace and locating Payard waaaaay in the back by the entrance to the convention center space. Payard is a cafe that does crepes, sells macaroons and other confectioneries, and sandwiches. Also, it is a very small bistro that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\u000a\u000aThe dining room in basically a round room set around the chefs cooking right in the middle. It is an interesting set up, but not one I was very fond of. First off, the chefs were wearing baseball caps. I don't know why this was such a turn-off to me, but it's probably because I don't expect to sit down in a French dining establishment and watch my food being made by a dude in a baseball cap. *shrug*\u000a\u000aLet's move on to the food... I started with the artichoke dip, which I thought was magnificent. It was not too soupy, nor too thick and there were actually large chunks of artichoke in it. The bread crumbs on top added a lovely compliment to the dish and the pita chips were a good balance between soft, and yet crunchy on the edges. That being said my friend ordered the Shrimp Panzanella, and it came out looking like a house salad from Chili's with two large shrimps dumped on it. Meh!\u000a\u000aSecond course, we both opted for the Sea Bass because neither of us were interested in eating chicken. Honestly I am glad it was served with mango salsa because if it had not been I would have been horribly disappointed. The sea bass was cooked very well, but the portion was small compared to the HUGE polenta cake it was placed on. I thought the polenta was strange - it almost tasted/looked like an ugly cornbread muffin from Marie Calendar's (credit to my friend for that description). \u000a\u000aLastly, dessert - absolutely delicious! Decadent, yummy, chocolatey! Oooo! I had the pont neuf a wonderfully decadent chocolate dessert. If anything I would suggest going to get the desserts here and just eating them on a table outside the cafe. Really the restaurant portion is lacking in the ambiance you would expect while eating French food, especially at the price tag they have here.\u000a\u000aSo, although it was good I would rather go somewhere else for French-faire.

VDo you ever walk into this store and think it looks a little jankity-jank compared to other stores in Town Square? Well, actually just other clothing stores in general. Maybe it's just me but I always feel like when I get into H&M the racks just look too full and the clothes are kinda haphazard and weird. Maybe it's their thing....\u000a\u000aBut with that being said, I do like H&M. The weird thing is I hardly ever leave the store with anything. It's like I go in, browse, like things, but then I just can't commit. I think it might be because my style is so simple. I'm a jeans and funny/ironic t-shirt kind of gal. Or I just like to wear a dress... but I don't like my dresses to have ridiculous things like zippers and flowers hanging all off of it.\u000a\u000aAll in all I do like H&M for what it is, but again I just can't get past the thrift-store look in what I assume is a nice store. Also, I have hardly ever been greeted and the employees here typically don't say much to the patrons.

VI've never been to this B-Dub's until my fiance and I were craving food while at Fry's Electronics down the street. My fiance wanted chicken strips so I pulled up BWW on my Yelp app. I'm a fan of hot wings and BWW in general. I like the atmosphere and sitting in the bar area is always a best bet for quick and friendly service typically.\u000a\u000aWe sat in the bar and we were quickly greeted by our waitress, who was talkative and nice. She asked me about my tattoo and we discussed local tattoo parlors as well. So for service I am going to say 5 stars for our waitress, but I can't remember her name.\u000a\u000aNext is food. Normally I order either boneless wings or normal wings. It's kind of a no-brainer. I mean, you are coming to BWW. But their potato wedges are really good too. On this visit I had a cheeseburger and let me tell you why. You see, there are a lot of fancy-schmancy burger places around town that will make you a burger with different types of sauces and rubs. They'll charge you an arm and a leg for them too. At BWW you can add any wing sauce or wing rub to your burger. Maybe the burger isn't top-notch quality, BUT you are getting a very interesting burger combo for a much cheaper price than at a burger joint that will upcharge you for EVERYTHING.\u000a\u000aI got my burger cooked with the chipotle rub and it was delicious. I also asked for a small container of the chipotle rub to sprinkle on my french fries - so good too. You also get a selection of cheeses at BWW and I tend to go with the pepperjack cheese for an extra kick. \u000a\u000aSo, it does pay to take a look at the menu at a place even if they are well known for a certain type of food. I'm sure I'll be back for the wings eventually.

VHey, hey the place where I go to.... shop? Well, not really. Besides going into the H&M here I don't believe I've ever come down here specifically to shop. Although, I have been known to buy some groceries at the Whole Foods. Is the Whole Foods a part of Town Square? Hmmm.\u000a\u000aWell, I like Town Square, I think it offers a lot of different things to do - so something for everyone really! Shopping, coffee shops, restaurants, and bars. Oh, not to mention the Rave movie theaters are here, which I love! Town Square is also usually getting some new store or place to eat. There's been a hookah lounge open up, a new froyo place, and there's the new Wine/Whiskey bar out there. HEY-YO! I gotta get me some of THAT. Two of my favorite things and I could be in big trouble. \u000a\u000aBesides the bars and stores there is also a quaint park area usually being trotted upon by families and little children. However, I did go down here and sat under some trees to read one afternoon. It wasn't bad, nothing like a real park, but if you pretend hard enough you might believe you're not in the middle of a shopping center. Oh, and you gotta deal with the roaring jumbo jets soaring overheard.\u000a\u000aOverall I give Town Square 4 Stars! They don't get 5 because it is an outdoor mall in Las Vegas, which means I do not wish to go here in the middle of summer.... EVER. And there sometimes seems to be an overwhelming amount of raucous teenagers doing... teenager things. I realize they can't help it if these mouth-breathers are around, but unfortunately it ruins my groove.

VThis business center is a joke. And I think some other reviewers on here are actually reviewing MGM the casino/hotel - I am not. I am reviewing their horrible business center which is directly the the right of the main check-in at the lobby.\u000a\u000aThe day I went in I was simply wanting to get some papers printed off of a laptop - that's it. I had cash and that was a big freaking mistake. You see, the business center does not take cash, either credit card OR you have to pay cash and then get a card. After precious minutes went by (because I needed this done quickly) I finally realized I had to get a card and the proceeded to wait in a line a mile deep because they only had ONE girl working the desk. Yes, one girl answering phones and dealing with every person in the business center. So I get my card, go back to the self-serve station with my laptop and OF COURSE the card does not work.\u000a\u000aI have to go back and tell the girl it is not working. So she tries the card, no go. At this point I became so intensely angry I walk out and some bell hops see my anger and frustration. So the bell hop takes me back in the business center and he actually goes behind the counter, through a door and finds someone to help me. Well, this person is an absolute idiot, he hands me a business card with an email on it and tells me to email the papers to the email address on the card and they will print them behind the counter and then... he DISAPPEARS! Yes, just leaves me. \u000a\u000aAFTER 45 MINUTES OF JACKING AROUND MY PAPERS ARE FINALLY PRINTED. Yes. 45 MINUTES.\u000a\u000aAre you serious MGM? You made my client late in starting his meeting because:\u000a\u000a1. You business center is not staffed well enough\u000a2. Those who run your business center are inept and not customer friendly\u000a3. Your business center just basically sucks.

VThe Brass Lounge is probably an often overlooked Fremont Street hangout unless it's a very busy Fri or Sat night and everyone is out and about hitting up all the hot spots. It is located on the second floor above Hennessy's/Mickie Finnz. You would not even know it was there if you weren't specifically seeking it out OR if you were being enticed into the establishment by the people on ground level. \u000a\u000aI have been to the Brass Lounge on two separate occasions. My most recent jaunt was just a random happening. My group happened to be passing by and we were given 2-4-1 drink coupons, which lead us directly inside, because - HEY - free drinks. Once you go up the escalator you enter the bar by taking a right, not a left because that takes you to a different section of the upstairs. The Brass Lounge cosists of a large, round bar, and a stage for dancing and karaoke. When we were there on a Wednesday night, there was karaoke going on. \u000a\u000aWe sat and ordered our drinks, which were extremely cheap indeed. We were pleased. We hung out for awhile and watched some karaoke. Not much else was happening, and although we enjoyed free drinks, Brass Lounge does not really offer much up in terms of out-of-the-box cocktails like other places on Fremont.\u000a\u000aOverall Brass Lounge is a good stop for cheap drinks and some entertainment if they happen to be doing karaoke on a night you are there.

VThings you will NOT find at Morel's:\u000a\u000aFresh fruit\u000aSeasonings\u000aPristine Service\u000a\u000aThings you will find at Morel's:\u000a\u000aOverpriced menu items for the quality being served\u000aOdd, bumbled service\u000aUnder-seasoned food\u000a\u000aMy friend and I decided to do breakfast at Morel's. We have somewhat of a tradition going on of trying new places to eat at. Our most recent jaunts have been to French places. Morel's comes in at our number three experience at a French restaurant on the strip and it is dead last based on service and food.\u000a\u000aThe reason for two stars has to do with the food primarily. I can overlook poor service if the food is spectacular, but Morel's is putting out average food parading as fresh French cuisine. With so many other better options to eat at on the Strip Morel's should be ashamed at what they are plating.\u000a\u000aTo begin we ordered the fruit plate. An assortment of tragically cut mediocre fruit is what was served. Blueberries that were not fresh, but looked as though they had been frozen for days. ONE strawberry haphazardly cut, a measly portion of pineapples, cantaloupe and honeydew melon. I could have gotten this assortment of fruit at Denny's, in a bowl, as a side dish, without the $11 price tag. Truly a waste.\u000a\u000aI had: Crab Eggs Benedict. While the presentation was perfect the execution was poor. It was plain and simple: BLAND. The crab was tasteless, the bread was decent, the entire dish - didn't seem to be seasoned at all! To add to this, there was no salt or pepper on the table. I realized I should have salted and peppered my dish about halfway through it and at that point I basically said screw it, I'm just going to finish it.\u000a\u000aMy friend had: Crab Omelet with a side of potatoes, mushrooms, and peppers. This was touted to be amazing by our server.... it was also bland, lacking any real depth or flavor. The dish sorely needed salt, just something to make the potatoes pop. I've had better breakfast potatoes at numerous establishments that could beat these by a long shot. My friend ordered a side of mustard just to give her meal a bit more kick to it.\u000a\u000aCosta Rican Pressed Coffee - At $5 for the press this is a bit of a splurge, but honestly the coffee was the best part of my meal.\u000a\u000aService - Our server was nice, but the busser didn't bother to acknowledge our table's presence when we sat down. We were approached by a server who wanted to take our order AFTER we had already put in our order with another server. I mean, stuff like this I might dismiss at other restaurants, but not at a place where I'm paying $11 for a plate of fruit. STEP UP YO GAME MOREL'S.\u000a\u000aOverall - I will not return here. There are numerous other places in Las Vegas to find a good breakfast. And honestly if they can't do breakfast right I have very low expectations of their dinner service and quality of steaks.

VCupcakes for Christmas. Who wouldn't love a cupcake for Christmas? I showed up to The Cupcakery on Monday afternoon to purchase cupcakes for my co-workers. I needed 5 and I was happy to see there would be plenty of selections for me to partake of. I saw they have many differing flavors, everything from chocolate to fruity to seasonal flavors. I was greeted when I walked in and waited for other patrons to make their choices.\u000a\u000aI had each of the cupcakes placed in separate boxes since they were gifts and the girl working obliged. She also let me know if I got just one more cupcake my total would be less, so I got one for my husband.\u000a\u000aI handed her my debit card which happens to be USAA. When she saw it she asked if I had military ID, to which I replied yes, and showed it to her. She gave me a percentage off, which was quite awesome! It's nice for stores to be on the look out to give discounts, even if their customers may not know about them.\u000a\u000aI received a stamp card and now that I know I can get a discount and had a good experience here I will go back. I'm only docking one star because I thought for some reason the shop itself would be a bit more "cute", but it was kind of plain inside.

VI adore Fresh & Easy. I just can't get enough of this place. I am determined to try every one of their pre-packaged scrumptious meals. Today I had the pesto salad with mozzarella and big juicy tomatoes. And tomorrow I'm going to have the shrimp, spinach, and tomato pasta I picked up on Sunday. Also - I'll be enjoying one of their addicting soups (french onion) later this week.\u000a\u000aF&E at this location has always served me well. I love the ability to waltz into a small establishment, grab exactly what I want, and with ease, self-check my way out. Now that is how I want to do my grocery shopping! Believe me, I'm a fan of Whole Foods/Trade Joe's as well, but F&E takes that same feel and makes it more intimate. True, there is less selection (you're not going to find fresh fish here), but for the run-o-the-mill grocery store run it is perfect!\u000a\u000aI think F&E also feeds a perfect niche of people (single professionals who don't want to eat garbage). \u000a\u000aMy only complaint with F&E is that on a few occasions I have noticed some of the produce has looked pretty beaten up and bruised. Other than that, F&E is the perfect convenient place to stock up for a week for a busy-body professional.

VAs a local of Las Vegas I rarely find myself on the strip, in casinos, or being anywhere tourists might be. Unfortunately, sometimes my job takes me to places, like The Palazzo, where I will be thrust into such a place, full of these types of people. I do appreciate casinos for what they are, but I just do not like them in general. Another issue for me is that in Las Vegas, there are many wonderful places to eat inside casinos which I rarely get a chance to see, and Espressamente Illy is one of those places.\u000a\u000aNext, I want to make a note on the prices. For those here on Yelp who are somewhat complaining about the prices, I have this to say: HI. You are in THE PALAZZO. Nearly every restaurant in here is owned by a Food Network star and the only other coffee place is The Coffee Bean, so if you want to hit up a chain, be my guest. But why do that when you can pay an extra dollar for a decent cup of espresso?\u000a\u000aYuuuuuuuuuum. This is what I had two out of the three days I was imprisoned in The Palazzo working. First day: shot of espresso and the Milano (chicken sandwich with roasted red peppers and cheese). I'm a sucker for a panini pressed sammie! This one was good, cheese was melted, peppers gave a nice hint of flavor. My espresso - perfect and creamy. Second day: I just splurged and got the Affogato (two scoops coffee gelato with an espresso poured over it). OH MY. Well, it was fantastic and I got quite a caffeine high afterward!\u000a\u000aService: MEH MEH. I did go when it was pretty busy, but damn it took me a LONG time to get my food. In fact, I ended up taking it to go even though I paid for the "dine in" fee. (YAH BEWARE! they will charge you .75 cents for the dine-in). I guess it's to compensate their dishwasher? *shrug* However, this is why they did not get 5 Stars.\u000a\u000aOVERALL: Go here if you are willing to pitch a few extra bucks. If you don't want to.... um, go to Ben & Jerry's or The Coffee Bean?

VOnce again I was trapped inside the Sands Convention Center working a convention. On the last day of the convention I decided to give myself a little gift of an affogato. This time I got the vanilla bean (heavenly by itself by the way) and the cappuccino flavored gelatos. \u000a\u000aIt is pricey, but it is worth it. The gelatos are just amazing. They are not mediocre and believe me, even though you are paying jacked-up fancy strip property prices it is worth it!\u000a\u000aThe only thing is that service this go-round was once again lacking. The employees just don't seem that happy. Perhaps it is because the place gets super packed during conferences and the employees get over-worked... but still, wish they were a bit more happy, they are serving delicious treats after all!

VWomp womp womp. This place is a such a downer - I have no idea why people come here and why it is so, so packed all the time. It must be their awesome discounts for people in the industry. I am not a casino worker and I am not down with paying $12 for a teeny watered down beverage.\u000a\u000aI have come to BM a few times before my last trip for my friend's birthday party and I have never been impressed. As many others here have pointed out - the place is for cooooougars and men who wish to prowl on divorcees. Other people you may find here - groups of girls who come for happy hour and leave before being hit on by sleez-os trying to dance up on them on the tiny dance floor. Lots of single dudes. Single dudes standing around in a martini bar.... \u000a\u000aAnyway - my friend had her birthday here on "Latin Night". We wanted a table in the back, but didn't get one because they said they weren't going to open the bar in the back. So, my friend - pissed by the way - agreed to be sat up toward the front, in much less nice seating. They shoved our 10 person party in space meant for about six and promised us we could have the table next to us as soon as the two cradle robbers at that table left. Right. *rolls eyes* I've been to a lot of clubs/bars in Vegas and I've been around a lot of promoters and I even did a stint of promoting myself. That right there is just crap service. Especially to locals.\u000a\u000aLet me also point out the fact that our waitress never came by to fill our drinks. I get it, it's busy, whatever. There was a table full frat-hats next to us, whom she was serving, but come on. You can't even come around once after the first time to refill drinks? I've been in PACKED clubs and I've had my drink refilled by the waitress many, many times during the course of a night.\u000a\u000aSorry, maybe call me spoiled by my desire to actually have bottle service when you're paying for BOTTLE SERVICE. If you're going to offer the option, and people are going to pay for the bottles - then step it up and do it.\u000a\u000aOverall - I never have any intentions of returning to BM, unless I'm invited to another birthday party.

VHere's my big tip about Yayo Taco: Order the fish tacos or the shrimp tacos. Oh and order the ceviche! \u000a\u000aI guess I happened to luck out by going all seafood the night I ate here. I'm not sure why, it might have had something to do with the fact that I was with my friend who is a vegetarian and I thought getting the fish may offend her less than say a heaping pile of carne asada. I am glad I did though. These tacos were soooo good. They are the perfect size too, so you can order a couple different ones and get a variety.\u000a\u000aThe night I went they were hosting a concert with a heavy metal band from Spain. That was really interesting to watch. This place definitely has that "college divey venue" feel. The bathroom is hideous, although not as bad as Double Down.\u000a\u000aMy only complaint is the tables are sticky gross. So if you can eat at the bar, it's much more clean. Supposedly there is a student discount for UNLV and CSN students - since I am neither of those things, it holds little consequence to me. I did note while there that some people there were complaining about the pricing here has risen. *shrug* Honestly I think it's pretty spot-on for what you're getting.\u000a\u000aWhen I go back here I am getting the fish/shrimp tacos and the ceviche. Seriously, their ceviche was delicious! I am picky about my ceviche too because I've grown up on a recipe my father learned to make when he lived in Panama. So if a place can impress me with that, then I am definitely going back!

V** Review is of bar seat-yourself Happy Hour ONLY **\u000a\u000aMy friend and I decided on Brio for a happy hour this past Monday. I was pretty excited to try it because I've heard really good things about their happy hour. \u000a\u000aWhen I arrived, it was PACKED. I could not find a seat at the bar, which was a bit disappointing, but I did find one of the tall tables around the bar. Just to note - you can ONLY get the happy hour at the bar or the tall tables around the bar area. \u000a\u000aThe table was still dirty when I sat down at it, but since it is "first come, first serve" I could not wait around for it to be cleaned off as people around me were quickly snagging up empty seats and tables. However, the busser did come by soon after I sat down and cleaned up.\u000a\u000aTo begin I ordered the Peach Sangria, which I must admit was delicious and a very good portion for a happy hour. The drinks are $5 and while that is not a bad price, it did not entice me to partake of more than one beverage while I was there. Soon after my drink arrived, so did my friend and when the waitress came around again we were all ready to order.\u000a\u000aI had the Brio Burger and the Artichoke Dip. As for the burger, I ordered it medium well, and it was cooked okay. The burger itself was nothing special. On the menu it is noted the burger comes with "special chips". This means kettle cooked chips. And when they say "chips" they mean 4 or 5 chips. Literally. My plate had 4 chips on it. \u000a\u000aNext - artichoke dip - it was too salty, but a decent texture and served piping hot. The pita chips were good, but they provide you with way too many for the small amount of artichoke dip they give you. \u000a\u000aMy friend also had the burger AND she had the spicy shrimp, which she said was not very spicy. She didn't finish the plate, so I assume they weren't very good.\u000a\u000aIn the end, would I go back? Yes. Why? Because it's a cheap happy hour and the sangria was good. The food was less than stellar, but I'd be willing to try something else off the menu. On a return visit if I was still meandering at just a 3 star rating, I probably would not return.

VI've been meaning to do a review of Yardhouse for awhile now as I have been on countless ocassions and  tend to always hit up this place if I happen to be out with a group at Town Square.\u000a\u000aHonestly I think the vibe of this place used to be a little better when Town Square wasn't as "known" as it is today. Meaning I liked it better when a niche group of people frequented the establishment and not everyone and their mother, plus their slutty cousin wearing a mini-dress and stupidly high heels from out of town was there. I just find it a *little* annoying when I show up to a *bar* and the people patronizing it look like go-go dancers. *shrug*\u000a\u000aAnyway, if you do go on a week night it has a much better vibe, more beer lovers and people just looking to wind down and relax in a cool bar.\u000a\u000aI absolutely do not recommend eating here unless you're doing happy hour. The prices in my opinion do not reflect the quality of food. I once got the chips and guac... and they literally put 20 chips on the plate. I counted and yes, I am serious.\u000a\u000aI like the selection of beer. I'm kind of limited though, because I usually drink wheat-beers or Smithwicks. However I have had some of the more fruity concoctions as well.\u000a\u000aOverall I think it is a good time, just heed the advice about going when the different crowds tend to be there. If you want to just hang out on a Saturday night and not be bombarded, probably not so good, so go on a week night, or if you do want a little more of the crowd and craziness then feel free to hit it up as a fun weekend spot!

VMeeting up with a friend at Yard House was a very good idea. It was a great idea to do before the soft opening of The Container Store. I was afraid they would not have many "apps" and "small bites" at the opening, so I figured Yard House would be a good place to grab something to eat, after all they do have a Happy Hour! \u000a\u000aI began with a Riesling, nothing special, but definitely on the HH menu, so the price made me happy at only $5.25 for a glass. After my friend joined me we decided to order our food. \u000a\u000aFood\u000a\u000aI had the the Hawaiian Poke Stack, after recommendations from my friend and the bartender. OMG. Mouth-gasm! I am so sad I have been missing out on this dish because it was freaking amazing! In fact, I am sad I have been missing out on poke period. Basically the dish consists of marinated raw ahi with crispy wontons, carrots, bean sprouts, avocado, wasabi soy sauce. I seriously probably would have eaten another one had we not been going to the opening of the Container Store. I highly recommend this dish.\u000a\u000aDrinks\u000a\u000aI had a Riesling and then went on to try the Hypnotini. Also a recommend from my friend and let me tell you, if you're going to get anything that is not beer at Yard House, you should get one of these drinks. Also, if you're a light weight - this is the only drink you'll need. After I had this and a glass of wine I was delightfully buzzed. \u000a\u000aService\u000a\u000aWe were seated at the bar, so our service came from the bartenders. They were quick to ask if we wanted more drinks and carefully laid out our spread for our food. I think the service was pretty awesome.\u000a\u000aOverall\u000a\u000aI am upping my review previously from 3 stars to 4 stars. I still believe YH's prices on certain dishes to be a bit pricey, but honestly you can't go wrong with their Happy Hour.

VI've been to Yard House quite a few times. I often frequent this place with friends or bring out of town guests here because the menu is extensive and there is something on it for just about everyone. Plus the beer selection, as well as the wine, and mixed drinks have the ability to please every palate. \u000a\u000aRecently I brought my sister and brother-in-law here based off of those facts. Three people with probably rather different tastes is kind of a hard combo to deal with when choosing a dining spot. Luckily, Yard House did the trick. \u000a\u000aThere was a wait when we arrived, but it was only about 10 minutes and we were seated in a large, comfy booth, although next to the kitchen and a bit noisy, it was okay as we could all still carry on a conversation without yelling to be heard. \u000a\u000aThe run down of the food went as following -\u000a\u000aGrilled Artichoke Appetizer - delicious! The artichoke was grilled perfectly and served with a garlic dipping sauce. We ate every bite and then tried to eat more. Baked potato chips were also served with it, the perfect appetizer.\u000a\u000aSeared Ahi Steak Sandwich - Okay, this was just about the best thing I've had to eat in a LONG time. The ahi was seared perfectly, somewhat cooked around the outside, and deliciously raw on the inside. The pairings in the sandwich were perfect- spinach, Swiss cheese, tomato, and caramelized onions. It comes on a rye bread and with shoe-string french fries. Honestly, this sandwich is worth every penny. \u000a\u000aCuban Roast Pork Dip - My sister ordered this sandwich and it looked very good. It came with a BBQ au jus and shoe-string french fries. \u000a\u000aHouse Salad & Clam Chowder - My brother-in-law opted for this. The soup came out piping hot and he said it was really good. My sister declared it to be good too. The house salad was BIG, much bigger than I was expecting, so kudos to YH on the portions. \u000a\u000aOverall I have to give it up to Yard House. This most recent visit was definitely a 5 star affair. Everything was cooked well, service was good, the wait wasn't long, the noise level was decent, and  we were in and out with zero problems.

VI'm going to base this review off of what this theater really is: a small theater that has not been updated in awhile and it probably will not be anytime soon. Living on the East side of the Valley your movie watching areas are limited, unless you want to drive a half an hour to go see a movie. Some nights the hubby and I just don't feel like making the drive, but we want to see a movie.Therefore: Boulder Station.\u000a\u000aThe theater is small, has only 11 screens, the customer service is wavering between okay and rude most of the time, but also inept as a majority of the people who run this theater are teenagers with a high turn-over rate. \u000a\u000aThe snack bar is overpriced, just like any other theater you will walk into these days. Theaters are small and unimpressive, but at least they have stadium seating. There's no huge IMAX screens here and I don't believe they do 3D, but if you just want to go see a movie - it will do.

VThe Wetlands Park is like not being in Vegas, yet, right there is Vegas. You barely have to get off the "beaten path" to get here. I am jealous of people who live in close vicinity because the walking trails here are perfect for a morning run. \u000a\u000aMy husband and I took a stroll here a couple weeks ago in the late afternoon. It was HOT. But there are quite a few shaded areas to walk through. You can see a lot of bunnies, lizards, turtles, and different bird species here. Plus there are even some fish in the murky waters.\u000a\u000aI would assume the area has running water when Las Vegas gets rain. However, when my husband and I went most of the pond areas were still, making the smell kind of atrocious. If you walk far enough back you will find the run-off coming from the water plant, which is, of course, what makes the wetlands.\u000a\u000aThere is a large modern looking building here. It was closed when my husband and I went, but there is a museum of sorts, some educational areas, and it looks as though a cafe is going to be opening up here soon.\u000a\u000aI plan to go back for sure. The walking paths again, as I said, are very nice, as most are concrete. There are a few trails that go off hat are not concrete.\u000a\u000aThis is definitely a "not Vegas" place. No casinos, no flashing lights. Just nature and what not. Of course, it is also FREE!

VThis is a great dog park. I love bringing all my dogs here because there are so many areas for them to play in. Usually one area might have more dogs than the other, so it's easy to just usher your dogs to another gated area if one is getting too rowdy (or if your pups are playing a little too rough). There's also a "small dog" area, although there is not actual signage, most patrons of this dog park have hailed the small dog area as what it is and most hold up the promise not to bring big dogs into this certain area.\u000a\u000aMost who come here are regulars and often they spend time talking while their dogs are playing around. My boyfriend and I enjoy making laps around the larger area while our dogs bounce along and play beside us.\u000a\u000aUsually dog poos are picked up, although you will find a few strays here and there (just watch where you are walking, duh!). Watering buckets are dispersed throughout the park, and there are even some trees and benches for lounging and being in the shade when it is hot.\u000a\u000aJust follow the rules, close gates, keep dogs out when you are going in and out, and do be courteous to all people and puppies! This park is really good about that. Great place to spend a few hours and let those doggies expend their energies!

VOkay. Wal Mart. What can I say? I guess I can say I frequent this particular Wal Mart the most out of any Wal Mart in Las Vegas. I've been in a lot of Wal Marts. They don't differ much. Unless you count the Wal Mart in Seward, Nebraska which has a claim to fame: it's the smallest "super" Wal Mart (groceries included) in the United States. Woo hoo, right? \u000a\u000aLike I said, Wal Mart is Wal Mart. There will always be trashtastic people and cheap goods. Cheap groceries and that icky feeling that slimes it's way down your back as you enter, knowing you're contributing to the evilness of the Wal Mart Empire.\u000a\u000aHowever, Wal Mart has a few redeeming factors, which I will list here:\u000a\u000a#1 Deli Pizzas. Seriously, I'm not even joking. The pizzas found in their deli section are delicious. They're the take and bake kind and they're better than Pizza Hut or Dominos. In fact, they're better than most frozen pizzas. \u000a\u000a#2 Nordicware Bakeware. Nordicware has become my favorite bakeware. It's sturdy, tough, and heavy, AND it is MADE IN THE USA. I try my best to keep my purchases on the USA side. But beware - some things Nordicware items are now made in China (mostly plastic things). So just read those labels!\u000a\u000a#3 Anchor, Sterilite, and Pyrex - Also all brands made in the USA for the most part. Again, check the label to make sure!\u000a\u000a#4 If you're in a pinch, there's always a Wal Mart. Is that a good thing? Maybe not, since it's an obvious sign of the monopolized times. BUT, somehow, someway it is also helpful.\u000a\u000aThat's Wal Mart. Oh yes, this one is quite ghetto. But one could PROBABLY say that about ANY Wal Mart.

VWhile heading to Tommy Bahama I was perplexed talking to my friend over the phone who had discovered they were offering a happy hour on a Thursday night. \u000a\u000a"What? You mean the place that sells the Hawaiian shirts?"\u000a\u000aWell yes, they do, but this one has a restaurant/bar attached to it. And they DO have a very wonderful happy hour menu. I started off with a Chardonnay ($6) and then moved on to their Mai Tai ($6). I wish I had had two Mai Tai's! It was delicious and it packed a punch! I was feeling a little tipsy. The presentation was nice too. \u000a\u000aI had the fish tacos off the happy hour menu. The tastes were delectable and even though they were tiny little tacos there was plenty of grilled fish in them. I love grilled fish tacos and I hate fried fish tacos, bleck. However they were a bit on the cool side. I think they may have been sitting for a few moments too long before being brought out. However, that didn't stop me from enjoying them.\u000a\u000aSo, those are all the good things. Here are some not-so-good things. First off there was a guy there "playing" guitar. I use quotations because half the time he was not actually playing his guitar, but instead messing around with his Mac Book which was playing his music for him? Eh, lame. Next off when I was drinking my wine the bartender swooped up the little decanter she had given me along with the wine glass, well there was still wine in it! My jaw literally dropped and I stared at her in disbelief. She quickly deposited it back in front of me and I snatched it up and poured the rest of the wine in my glass quickly. I don't know if it was an accident, but either way it was incredibly awkward. Lastly, the bartender also dropped off the incorrect check for my friend and I (and then we never saw her again). A new bartender arrived who prodded us into purchasing more drinks, but then left us and never returned to see if we actually wanted more drinks.\u000a\u000aLuckily another bartender finally noticed our displeasure because I'm assuming it was radiating from us after being given a check that was #1 not ours and #2 WAY more expensive than our actual check. This bartender was very nice and quick to fix the mix up though.\u000a\u000aIn conclusion - Tommy Bahama's not just for ugly pineapple shirts anymore!

VMy husband and I ended up at Simon on Valentine's night 2014. I was attempting to get us to Max Brenner at Ceasers's Palace, but traffic was horrendous and we missed our reservation. Probably my fault considering I didn't take into account getting off on Flamingo would be such a cluster-F. Which then we ended up trying to back-track by getting off on Tropicana, and dun dun dun.... so the story goes of the local girl who doesn't realize just how horrible the Strip can be on a holiday weekend. Lesson learned.\u000a\u000aSo I said what the heck, there's The Palms, let's just try to eat somewhere there. We arrived at Simon after I called and asked what their dress code was, since my husband was dressed in jeans and nice tennis shoes. Biz casual. Good to go. We sat at the bar, because we were the couple without reservations on V-Day. \u000a\u000aI was in a not-so-great mood, but the yummy drink with Pop-Rocks the bartender made me feel better! My husband opted for Fat Tire. We dined on their "special" menu for that night. We ordered an app of grilled spicy edamame, very good, with a very distinct spice and lime flavoring. We both got the filet mignon ($38 - and well worth it!), medium rare, with mushrooms, comes with a wine reduction sauce and something like a garlic aioli. The filet was great, tender, and melt-in-your-mouth. We also ordered a side of mashed potatoes to share. Yikes. They were SO SALTY. I couldn't even stomach them.\u000a\u000aService was so-so, the bar was full, but I was left without a drink on more than one occasion and my husband too. \u000a\u000aOverall, bar service and food were 4 stars. I wouldn't go with a 5 because of the offending salty mashed potatoes.

VFaaaaaaaaaabulous!\u000a\u000aI can't believe it, I had such a glorious time getting my hair dyed. I love Shag Me Salon and it is so close my house I will never have to worry about being late to an appointment. \u000a\u000aI went in primarily to do a complete turn-around with my hair color. I have had brown/dark brown varying hair for about 4 years. Naturally I am a brunette, but I have been quite a few different colors. This go-round I was hankering for a "Emma Watson Copper/Blond/Brown" look. I don't know why, but I just love her style and her hair color. \u000a\u000aOf course, I know you're not going to get EXACTLY what you want and I discussed this with my hairdresser. She talked me through the whole process though, and we did some collaboration based on what she could do with my hair/what I wanted. Luckily my hair took quite well to the products and how it turned out was AWESOME. \u000a\u000aI love my new look and in order to maintain I will absolutely go back to Shag Me Salon. Oh my stylist also gave me a little trim as well. So happy with the result! :)

VWhat brought us in: a multitude of different sounding foie gras dishes.\u000a\u000aTo start with, the foie gras was a disappointment. Out of everything we had here it was my least favorite. We decided to go out on a limb and order the steamed foie gras with egg custard dish. It came out last, although I believe it was the very first thing we ordered (odd). This foie gras was probably one of the most disappointing pieces of foie gras I have ever had. It tasted much more like a breast of duck grilled. The egg custard had a smooth texture and was sitting in what tasted to me like miso soup. ($10)\u000a\u000aMoving on, we ordered "off menu" from their chalkboard specials. So, we went all out, because why not? We ordered the monk fish which came in a bowl swathed in some sort of brown jello. The jello had a taste I just could not come to terms with while the monk fish was much like a fish pate, but my friend said it looked like cat food. ($10)\u000a\u000aNext - Wagyu Beef Sashimi - 6 very thinly cut pieces. Mouth-watering and delicious. Absolutely superb, but I would have liked to have had 6 more. ($20)\u000a\u000aOn to the skewered items we shared. Kobe Beef with Wasabi - also delicious, just like the wagyu, only this time, grilled with a distinct flavor and of course, it was great quality meat. Pork cheek - also delicious, I am a fan of fatty items like this. \u000a\u000aThat's all she wrote. We skipped dessert because we were afraid it would come out in tiny portions and we were ready to go because we had already spent a buttload of money and we were still hungry.\u000a\u000aThe food is superb quality, obviously. Presentation is perfect. But I just did not feel as though it was worth the money I spent to still be hungry afterward. I think this was one of those, "Well, we tried it, so that's all." types of places for myself and my friend. \u000a\u000aThe restaurant itself it small, but decorations and seating and ambiance are pluses in my book for a restaurant of this size. Service was also good, our waters were kept filled and everything came out in a timely manner (save for the foie gras).\u000a\u000aMake a rez, as we were there on a Wednesday night without one, and although they allowed us to have a table we were given a time limit on how long we could be there.\u000a\u000aMy overall return factor is low, unless I plan to take a client here to impress them and use my company credit card for the bill.

VThis is my favorite place to get froyo. Period.\u000a\u000aI have frequented numerous other froyo places around the Vegas valley, yet they just never seem to match up to this one. I don't know if it's the location, or the varying flavors, or the fact that it is always clean....\u000a\u000aAnyway, the place is located conveniently in Town Square, close the the movie theaters and also close to the parking lot. What I like about the location is, you can park and walk to Yogurtland without having to walk THROUGH Town Square.\u000a\u000aThe store is always clean when I have been here and the employees are constantly cleaning the area around the toppings and syrups. They are also always re-filling the toppings. Never has there been a time where I have not gotten exactly what I was craving on my yogurt.\u000a\u000aTheir sherbet yogurts are some of the best I've ever had and normally I go for more savory flavors like chocolate or cake batter. BUT I do enjoy the sherbets here. \u000a\u000aThere's not much else to say. It's just good froyo.

VLess fries more chicken please.\u000a\u000aLess bread more chicken please.\u000a\u000aLess ice-tea more chicken please.\u000a\u000aLook I get that people rave about Raising Cane's, but to be perfectly honest I only believe it to be an okay establishment. It does have its place in many people's chicken strip loving hearts, but my experiences here have been lackluster.\u000a\u000aThe last time I went I got the 3-strip combo, which comes with 3 chicken strips, french fries, and of course, their tasty bread. I got a Dr. Pepper, because I don't like their sweet iced tea (ohmahgawd! I know.) It's too sweet. It's nothing like my Mother's Texas Tea, and well, she makes it better so she wins, the end.\u000a\u000aAs for the combo meal, I felt like I had more carbs than anything else. Were the fries good? Ya. Was the bread good? Ya. Were the chicken strips good? Ya. But I felt like I should have had more chicken strips than anything else, and my chicken strips were very much on the small side. If you're going to base your establishment on chicken strips, shouldn't those suckers be BIG, juicy, and plentiful?! \u000a\u000aI also made the mistake of taking an order to go. Don't do it. The take-away box makes everything soggy, especially the fries and bread. Best to just eat there, unless you live less than 5 minutes away.

VI LOVE Jamba Juice. I just never get around to going here as often as I would like. Also, I make my own smoothies at home (saves a bit of money). However, when I really feel like taking myself to Jamba it is never a disappointment.\u000a\u000aHonestly I can never really remember which smoothies I get. I tend to hop all over the menu mostly because I like all fruit and I don't have anything I really can't stand. \u000a\u000aAnd just to be clear - they have amazing oatmeal. Oh I love it so much. Steel cut oats with fruit and other toppings. Don't say it isn't good - it is! \u000a\u000aI love that they also have the wheatgrass shots here. They are amazingly refreshing and good for you. Try one if you haven't yet. \u000a\u000aThis particular JJ has a nice staff, very accommodating and helpful. They're right outside a gym so I assume hey have to get quite busy at peak times, but whenever I get in here there's only a few patrons or none at all. I hope that doesn't mean they will be going anywhere anytime soon because it is the closest smoothie/juice bar to my house!

VI can't believe I am giving a Starbucks a 1 star review.\u000a\u000aThat being said, I stopped in at this Starbucks after a meeting with my photographer for my wedding and before I had to be at work. It was convenient for me and in the area. There's a drive-thru, but because I had plenty of time before I had to be at work I figured I would just go in.\u000a\u000aThe place was full of people, but there were some free seats. I walked right up and put in my order. Mocha, iced, non fat, no whip. Doo doo doo.... So I figure I'll go sit down at a table and wait. Surely I will hear them call my drink. NOPE.\u000a\u000aNot once did I hear my drink called. NOPE. DIDN'T CALL MY DRINK. So I walk up to the bar (mind you, it's really only been about 4 minutes, but there was ONLY 2 people who ordered after me) and I see my drink, just effing sitting there. As I see it, the barista starts to take it away and gives me this "WTF do you want?" look. And then he snottily says, "Are you waiting for a drink?" And I said, "YES" and he says, "Well we've been calling this one out for awhile."\u000a\u000aYEA. CUZ I TOTALLY DIDN'T HEAR YOU CALL MY DRINK IN THE QUIET, SMALL AREA WE'RE ALL IN RIGHT NOW.\u000a\u000aWhat a little bitch.

VAfter a whole slew of problems getting a  hold of someone at Silverton who would book my reservation for my rehearsal night dinner for my wedding at the buffet, I finally did actually book the reservation. I even gave my credit card number to hold the reservation as the guest list for my party was 25 people.\u000a\u000aWe arrive at Seasons on the night of my rehearsal dinner and the incompetent girls at the register know nothing of my reservation. In fact, they point out to me, "We don't take reservations". As I slid into a monumental ball of anger and lost it, yes I really did, lose it on this girl, she finally got the idea I was not joking and got her "manager". Ah yes, to no surprise, and to my chagrin - who was the manager? The woman I booked the reservation through! Since I was about to start peppering this woman with the worst curse words I could think of, my mother and father stepped in and spoke with her. Oh, well our reservation had gotten "lost in the scuffle" of Silverton changing over management styles and who takes reservations for what. WELL THEN - where is my credit card information!? I'd like to know that.\u000a\u000aThen the lady says, don't worry we are setting up the table now. Okay. What if there had not been enough room in the buffet to seat our 25 person table, what then? As the lady keep apologizing and we march into the buffet with little servers still scurrying around trying to set up our non-existent reservation I am still hopping mad.\u000a\u000aThe food is mediocre. There's a pasta bar - woo hoo. There's hardly any selection of varying ethnic cuisines. The only decent section is the dessert bar. On our night there they were making excellent bananas foster. \u000a\u000aThey didn't comp us. They only apologized after my father insisted they apologize to us for losing our reservation. They still charged us for drinks even though they ROYALLY FUCKED UP.\u000a\u000aNever again. And I suggest no one ever eat here and definitely don't even attempt to make a reservation ANYWHERE at Silverton - they'll lose it - and your CREDIT CARD NUMBER TOO!

VAs far as Targets go this one is okay. Sometimes I walk in here and it's a mess, other times everything is perfect and in place. The flip of the coin is what stops me from giving it anything other than an "okay". \u000a\u000aThe one thing I like about this Target is that it does have Starbucks inside it. It's nice to go for a Target shopping trip and be able to get a nice beverage on the way out. \u000a\u000aI don't know if this happens to anyone else, but it seems to always happen to me and it ticks me off all the time. I'll be standing in a checkout line and a Target employee will tell me to go to the customer service counter to check out. As I'm walking over there someone zips in from the front door and has a lengthy exchange process to be taken care of and  I have to huff and puff myself back to the regular checkout aisles pissed off. \u000a\u000aLet's leave the normal customers in the checkout lines okay Target?

VOften I have a hard time giving a restaurant (or any place for that matter) five stars. But Texas de Brazil was amazing. Delicious meats, interesting atmosphere, fun for my family, and absolutely perfect for my birthday meal.\u000a\u000aBe warned - it is pricey, expect to pay $50+ for each person. It is worth it. First off they have a fantastic salad bar. This is no ordinary salad bar, it is complete with delicious Brazilian-style salads, tabbouleh, sushi, many different soups (Lobster bisque!), delicious garlic shrimp, scrumptious meats and cheeses, sun dried tomatoes.... oh I could go on.\u000a\u000aThe service is delightful as well. When you leave your table, your napkin is quickly folded up and placed nicely beside your plate. Although our server was a bit slow to bring out my father's wine it was good none the less. Soft drinks come in tiny bottles and are poured into large glasses at the table. Kind of odd - why not just fountain? I prefer the taste of fountain Coca Cola to it out of the bottle, but I digress. \u000a\u000aNext is the meat. THE MEEEAAATTTT. My parents had been to a Brazilian steakhouse... in Brazil, so they knew exactly what to expect. My brother and myself - we weren't really sure. But the way it all works is just so fun and the when the meat starts coming, boy does it start coming. Before I knew it I had lamb chops, pork loin, flank steak, bacon wrapped fillet Mignon, and ribs on my plate! Don't forget the fried bananas! Those were almost my favorite part of the meal.\u000a\u000aTheir desserts are lovely too. I ordered Creme Brulee and the waiter had a "Happy Birthday" message written on the plate in raspberry sauce. Quite literally this dessert is a piece of heaven.\u000a\u000aOur bill for four people - $256. \u000aOur experience - Priceless!\u000a\u000aI would not make Texas de Brazil an all the time thing. In fact, I doubt I'd go back there just for dinner. I really think of it as one of those great celebration type of restaurants. So if you're having a birthday or an anniversary or perhaps even a date, it's a great place to go.

VThis Whole Foods on Las Vegas Blvd and right in Town Square is probably one of my least frequented Whole Foods. Mainly because I will try to avoid it because of the amount of traffic and time it takes to get here. Also, the place is a awash with tourists. AKA people who are staying on the strip and want to stock their hotel rooms up with organic goodies.\u000a\u000aOther than that the store is a good size. They still have the hot/cold food bars, etc. and everything you would come to expect from a Whole Foods.\u000a\u000aI came for beans, and really enjoyed the amount and different style of beans they have to offer. In fact, I had no idea there were such kinds of beans to be found in this world until I shopped at Whole Foods for them. They had a lot of "heirloom" beans, which may be out just for the fall season, I'm not sure.\u000a\u000aCheckout was all right, the cashier was a little haughty towards me, but oh well, I can live.\u000a\u000aOverall I'd return if I were in the area.

VI am both a coffee snob and a coffee-addict. The thing is, I will drink coffee anywhere, anytime, with any people, for any reason. Ya, I'll even go as low to drink Maxwell House if it's sitting in a cup in front of me. That's where my "addict" part comes to play. \u000a\u000aI am on the other hand a coffee snob. I distinctly know the difference between a decent, pure cup of coffee, and a bad cup of coffee. Good coffee has a robust taste, it is not exactly watery, nor is it creamy, it is a good in-between. Good coffee can be drunk without cream and sugar because the taste of the coffee is neither really bitter, biting, nor is it totally flat. The best coffee in my opinion comes fair-trade, organic, and brewed very well. \u000a\u000aSunrise Coffee has this kind of coffee. I was somewhat skeptical as to whether or not it would please me, even with the multiple Yelp reviews that say it is fantastic. But I confess, it was held up to all expectations and then some. I only ran in to grab a cup of coffee to go (I suppose I could have gone through the drive-thru, but I wanted to see the inside), but it is some of the best coffee I have ever, ever had. I have only had better coffee at a few coffee shops in Portland, Oregon.\u000a\u000aI wish Sunrise was not so far away from me. I ran by there because I happened to be in the Henderson area. If it were closer to me I would absolutely be there many times a week. The inside is laid back with nice music, and a very inviting staff. And there is free WiFi! Woo hoo!\u000a\u000aThe only reason it does not get 5 Stars is because of the poor location. Not just because it is far from me, but because of the strip-mall location. I wish the owners might consider purchasing a building that is not in a strip-mall because this coffee shop begs to have its own building, set apart from other places.

VHave to feed a bunch of people on the cheap? BUT you don't want it to be bad food? Ya know, sometimes when you get into those large quantities of food the quality drops. Welp, not at Naploi's. \u000a\u000aI was working at the Barrett Joackson Car Auction at Mandalay Bay and we had a lot of hungry workers to feed. Of course pizza is a go to in a situation like that. We called up Napoli's and ordered three 30-inch pizzas. One with half plain cheese, and half veggies. The other two we got the meat lovers. \u000a\u000aFirst off - awesome they could deliver to us at the Auction as it was a busy event and the pizza delivery person had to call us and park in a parking lot not on the property. He waited for us to walk out to get the pizzas.\u000a\u000aEveryone who was eating the pizza said the same thing: GREAT PIZZA! I personally thought the cheese was the best part. The meat was plentiful, as were the veggies. The meat pizza was a bit too greasy for me, but it was still good. But the veggie one was amazing! So many vegetables! They did not skimp. Although, I do think there were a bit too many onions. I picked a bunch off my slice, but hey, some people may like that many. *shrug*\u000a\u000aObviously I've never dined-in, but the delivery service is awesome and the pizzas made a whole lot of hungry people VERY happy!

VI must admit, the first time I ate at Via Brasil I probably would have given 4-stars, but after my second visit I gotta go with 3 instead.\u000a\u000aLet me begin first by saying I don't think VB is a bad place to eat. In fact, I think it's a very nice restaurant with very nice wait staff (including bussers, hostess, waiters, everyone!). On both of my visits I was pleased as punch with the service and the arrival of the meats/cheese bread/condiments/beverages. \u000a\u000aHowever, on my second visit some of the magic wore off from the first visit. I went here for a birthday dinner with my fiance. On a Saturday night I made a reservation, expecting the place to be busy, but it definitely was not. Kind of a plus for us, except for the fact they sat us out in the middle of the floor. I was kinda disappointed with the seating and hoping we could have been seated in a more secluded part of the restaurant, but it was okay...\u000a\u000aAs for food. The meats were okay, minus the salmon, which was delicious. I tend to skip the sausages and chicken-type meats when I come to a Brazilian steakhouse. I must say though, I think all of the meats were overly-salty. Cooked well? Yes. But just salty. I went through three glasses of water.\u000a\u000aThe salad bar I think is okay, but not as good as Texas de Brazil.\u000a\u000aOverall I'm saying it's an okay place. It is cheaper than Texas de Brazil. It is more intimate than Texas de Brazil. I enjoy the ambiance here. I wouldn't NOT reccomend Via Brasil, but it will probably be awhile before I go back.

VYou know what is great about Frankie's Tiki Room? It is a bar I would go back to and there are so very few bars in Las Vegas I can say that about.\u000a\u000aWent here on a Saturday night with a bunch of friends. Even though it was late we were still able to find some seating for everyone. And if there is one thing I look for in Vegas it is definitely seating. I am not interested in standing around in high heels ordering over-priced drinks in a club.\u000a\u000aThe drinks are amazing and the atmosphere is relaxed and fun. Not uppity and glam-fested like all the bars on the strip. It is funny - the more I explore around Vegas the better places I find. I guess Vegas does have some decent places to go on a Saturday night, you just won't find them on the strip.

VUpdate time! I took a bunch of out of town friends here last night and we all really enjoyed it. My friends loved it because of their really strong drinks. Plus we scored a table that would fit all seven of us.\u000a\u000aWe all had a different drink off of their specialty drink menus. Since I was driving I just got a "2 skulls" concoction. Yes, the way they rate their drinks by how much alcohol is in it is by skulls underneath the description of the drink! \u000a\u000aHere's a tip: If you're out with a big group and you don't mind sharing drinks, then make sure everyone gets something different. ALL of the specialty drinks are blended really well so you'll pretty much enjoy anything on the menu if you like fruity rum-based drinks. Plus everyone can have a sip of everyone elses' drink. Mine had a very pineapply taste and it went down smooth. \u000a\u000aFrankie's is a fun time, especially if you like the dark bar type of place. But is also an awesome place to take out-of-towners to show them a different side of Vegas!

VWait and wait and wait and.... wait some more?\u000a\u000aMy boyfriend and I went to this Olive Garden this past weekend on Friday night. I had just worked a long shift outside and I was hankering for their bread sticks. The craving just hit me and I could have nothing else.\u000a\u000aOf course, on a Friday night the place was packed, especially with a lot of families. We asked how long the wait was and we were informed it would be 30 minutes. Typical, so we went outside and waited. Luckily, I don't believe we waited much more than 30 minutes until we were seated.\u000a\u000aThe place was really loud, but what can you expect? Tons of families and it's Olive Garden, so I guess you just get over it. I decided to get their dish that is featured on the menu: Stuffed Rigatoni with Grilled Chicken. My boyfriend opted for the Chicken Ceaser Salad. Of course, my meal came with the huge salad and bread sticks. The salad was on par with what you normally get. The bread sticks always came out yummy and buttery and slightly salty. I don't know what they do to them, but they're so good!\u000a\u000aNext - the meals were okay, nothing spectacular. The chicken was disappointing, obviously Olive Garden gets their chicken strips out of frozen bags. The pasta was pretty good and the white sauce, well I can't complain about it. Boyfriend said his salad was pretty good. What I don't get is Olive Garden's prices - they seem a bit high to me. I mean, I realize it's "Italian" (ha ha), but it's Olive Garden... I shouldn't have to pay $13.95 for mediocre lasagna. \u000a\u000aWhat was the worst part of the experience was the waiting for our food and waters to arrive. The service was so slow my boyfriend and I commented on it several times. That's when you know your service is bad - you notice it. Yes, they were busy and yes, it was Saturday night, but still, I gotta say the service was rather mediocre.\u000a\u000aAll in all, Olive Garden is still as mediocre as it ever was. I don't think I'll be returning for dinner on a Friday night any time soon. Probably gonna stick to lunch and their unlimited salad, soup, bread sticks promo.

VHonestly what is not to love about In-N-Out Burger? They have tasty, well prepped burgers and french fries. Service is 99.9% of the time great - most likely because this burger chain actually pays their employees decent wages and from what I have heard from friends who have worked there - the chain actually does have a good rapport with their employees.\u000a\u000aAny In-N-Out I have been to is squeaky clean and employees are consistently cleaning the tables and floors - not just this specific one. At this one in particular I have noticed the drive-thru can start to get a little out of hand, but usually they will send out an extra person to start taking orders.\u000a\u000aWhy I love In-N-Out over most burger chains - their burgers have a crispness to them, the lettuce is not soggy, the tomatoes are fresh, you can get your onions grilled. The french fries are cut fresh (you can see them doing it). The shakes are very good. \u000a\u000aThe menu is simple. Yet... we all know of the "secrets" behind what you can order at In-N-Out. I applaud them for not layering bacon and BBQ sauce and all kinds of other crap onto their burgers like so many other chains do. \u000a\u000aIn-N-Out knows what they're doing and I appreciate that.\u000a\u000aPS - This was the very first In-N-Out to open in Las Vegas and it was a ridiculous madhouse when it opened.

VHere's the deal, Fat Boy's is awesometacular. It is totally deserving of the 5 Star Rating it has here. \u000a\u000aIt is incredibly close to my house, located in a strip mall off of Stewart and Lamb. Not the greatest location ever, but hey, it's close to me so that makes me happy (and afraid for my waist line). \u000a\u000aI arrived around 6 PM on a Friday night, there were two guys working behind the counter. I had already decided what I wanted before I got there so I had no need to look at the menu. I was taking my order to go so I gave one of the guys my order and he started cooking it up (YEP! they put the burger on the grill AFTER you order it). Then the other guy there rang me up and got me my drink cup.\u000a\u000aI ordered: Guac BOYger, Chencho Fries, and a Soda - to go.\u000a\u000aI am disappointed. My fries were not chencho fries, but the "fat fries". :( They were still good though, and the burger was pretty good too. Small, but had a great taste and was cooked perfectly. \u000a\u000aNot sure what happened, guess the guy I gave my order to just hear "fat fries" and not "chencho fries"? Oh well, I'll definitely be getting them the next time I go back, which I'm sure will be relatively soon. As for the GUAC boyger, I think I'll try a different burger next time. It was good, but I definitely saw the dude put the guac on my burger and it came out of a squirty bag thing. Soooo, not fresh guac here which is kinda disappointing. I'm kinda picky about my guac, so out-of-the-bag versions don't really sit well with me.\u000a\u000aHowever, I do plan on return trips here. It's good food, it's made to order, and it's relatively cheap!

VHad to do an update for Fat Boy.\u000a\u000aThis go-round I enjoyed their pizzas delivered! Yes indeedy, they do delivery... To my house anyway. ;)\u000a\u000aHere's the scoop, we got 3 large pizzas and an order of mild wings. The delivery took just about 40 minutes. The guys delivering were super nice and the pizzas were damn good. I really liked the wings though. \u000a\u000aWould I order from them again? Yep! Especially gotta get those chicken wings!

VYes! Thank you for having a wonderful staff at your fabric counter! I have run into so many pissy people who work at fabric counters, but the ladies at this Joann's were very, very helpful. \u000a\u000aMy friend in Canada was in dire need of a certain fabric only carried in Joann stores in the U.S. and she needed me to get her 10 yards of this exact fabric. When I went to this Joann's I was terribly disappointed to see they only had 3 yards left on the only bolt they had. But Joann's employees to the rescue! The ladies here called the only other Joann's in Las Vegas and had them save me the rest of the fabric my friend needed.\u000a\u000aBesides this experience I have always had good experiences at this Joann's. It is clean and the employees are helpful. I find most of their prices to be reasonable. Although I wish they carried more products produced in the USA... but that is hard to come by these days.\u000a\u000aA+ service! Thank you! :)

VAn exceptional experience with Cajun food + white table cloth service and charming staff + delicately lit dining room, and gorgeous views of Las Vegas through large glass windows (if you get a seat upstairs).\u000a\u000aMy family and I came to Rhythm Kitchen during Las Vegas Restaurant Week. We arrived a few minutes before our reservation and waited for the hostess to prep our table. After we were ushered into their dining room, which is classy, yet has a feeling that you will be served Cajun/French Creole food from the heart.\u000a\u000aNot everyone in my party dined on the RW Menu, but I did, as did my mother and God-mother. \u000a\u000aFor starters when I checked into Yelp the restaurant offered a free drink, including their house wines. I opted for the white, a Chardonnay that was decent, but not anything surprising. My father ordered the house Merlot, also a decent varietal, but nothing special. However, they do have an extensive wine menu that I glazed over seeing numerous choices from France, Spain, and the like.\u000a\u000aNext - for appetizer my family opted for two orders of the alligator tail, one grilled with a spicy seasoning and the other deep fried. The alligator was surprisingly tender and had the consistency of a medium-well done steak. I like both versions, but preferred the grilled with the extra spice.\u000a\u000aWe were also served tasty, warm rolls and hush puppies with honey-butter. AMAZING hush puppies. Deep-fried to perfection, and a lovely spicy taste... I think there must have been some jalapenos added to the batter. But these were quite addictive.\u000a\u000aAs for my order, I started with the Cashew Vinaigrette Salad- Mixed Greens In A Spicy Cashew Vinaigrette Topped With Red Onions, Red Peppers & Crispy Wontons. The addition of red onions and red peppers to this salad made all the difference, adding spiced-up flavors one does not typically have in a garden varietal salad. The crispy wontons add a very nice mix to the mouth-feel and are kind of like a "better'" version of a crouton.\u000a\u000aNext up, main course: N'Awlins Seafood Delight- Blackened Catfish Over Rice With A Rich & Creamy Alfredaux With Shrimp. This was a delicious, creamy main course. The catfish was main star, having a flaky grilled exterior, and a melty white fish center. And it was a good portion. Shrimp were plentiful as well, no skimp on the shrimp here. The alfredaux pulls everything together, making you believe you are in New Orleans... not South Las Vegas.\u000a\u000aLastly, dessert. Homemade Bread Pudding Served With Bourbon Sauce. Their bread pudding was certainly... different. It is a firm cake, dense. The bourbon sauce here is served cold and it is a white sauce (some places offer brown). I was not a fan. I was expecting a warm bread pudding and a warm white sauce. The was neither. But. It wasn't *bad* and had a very NUTMEG flavor to it. It is just different, that is all.\u000a\u000aOverall - Service was prompt, genuine and our server was congenial to our large group. Food overall was as expected with pops of surprises and flourishes of creativity from whoever is chef here. I would certainly come back.

VSet scene:\u000a\u000aYou, your loved one, and  the fountains of Bellagio. Plus having had a couple drinks so you can easily sway along to the music without feeling like complete fools in front of Las Vegas tourists. \u000a\u000aI've never appreciated the Bellagio Fountains fully until I took them in with a person I really, really care for. The water, the lights, the music, it just makes for something surreal you aren't going to see anywhere else.\u000a\u000aOh and it's free.

VIt's been awhile since I've had a really good hot dog. Thank goodness Detroit Motor City delivered! I hit this joint up this afternoon with my friend for a little pre-movie meal. I have never been to Detroit, but eating here made me want to check it out.\u000a\u000aI ended up getting the Detroit style hot dog, minus the spicy cheese. And I also got their absolutely freaking fantastic onion rings. Every single onion ring was perfectly battered and fried. Each and every time I bit into my onion ring it came away perfectly (Ie: the onion did not pull out or away from itself), that is the sign of a GOOD onion ring. The dog was tasty too, it had a snap and even though I was a bit skeptical, all the ingredients on it made it really good. I was even tempted to ask for extra jalapenos, but I resisted. ;)\u000a\u000aOh, you gotta make sure to get the root beer! When I find myself in Henderson again I know where I'm going.....

VAh, The M Resort. Why are you so far away?\u000a\u000aThis jewel in the desert, far south on Las Vegas Blvd is definitely in competition for being my favorite casino in Las Vegas. However, since it is unbelievably far away from me, it does not have that honor. It is still an amazing casino.\u000a\u000aI have been here to check out The Hostile Grape, Hash House A Go Go, and Studio B Buffet. The casino offers a wide range of restaurants to eat at and they aren't your "run of the mill" casino places either.\u000a\u000aThe casino floor itself is well kept and the air is clean and well circulated. The outside of the casino is well kept as well and the parking is convenient.\u000a\u000aOn one trip here my mother and I won money on the video poker machines. In fact, my mother won a big jackpot. The slot attendants were quick and nice. They congratulated my mom and said it was great that she was local and had won. \u000a\u000aThe M Resort is awesome. I hope someday to have a staycation here so I can write another review about their rooms.

VNo thanks McKee, no thanks.\u000a\u000aWith nothing much to do on a Saturday afternoon my boyfriend and I headed out to McKee Ranch to look at their pumpkin patch and select a pumpkin for carving and making tasty baked pumpkin seeds with. But my goodness this poor excuse for a "pumpkin patch" is ridiculous!\u000a\u000aFist off, you can't tell who is an employee here. My boyfriend and I were both bewildered as to how the pumpkin purchasing worked, and on top of this we simply walked into the ranch without paying (upon us leaving I noticed a sign that said "$20 per family"). 20 bucks?! No. Way. I would never pay that much to walk into this tiny "ranch".\u000a\u000aThere are a ton of horses, which were pretty much the highlight of the whole experience. But there was no clear way to feed them - or if it was even OKAY to feed them! There was also a Shetland Pony and a Clydesdale. After wandering around a bit we were both kind of amused and disappointed in our random trip here. \u000a\u000aNote: the place is like a hodge-podge of old stuff. Let's say an episode of Hoarder's threw up all over an outdoor farm area - that's what this place looks like. Oh, not to mention the random chickens just wandering around and the poor little billy goat I saw cowering behind a fence surrounded by cacti, probably because he was tired of all the little kids and people messing with him.\u000a\u000aMy boyfriend and I grabbed a pumpkin on our way out, but then realized neither of us had cash on hand to give to the guy collecting money at the door (first time I noticed any exchange of funds). So we deposited our pumpkin back where it came from and walked out, not having paid, not having had a really good time.

VI can say that this place is unique unto itself. The M does a good job of hiding it down in a cubby hole to make you really feel like you're walking down into a wine cellar. But honestly, that walk is a killer if you're a lady in high heels, which I was. They should at least offer an elevator... for safety reasons. Wine cellar + drinking + stairs = hummm....\u000a\u000aAnyway, the atmosphere is exactly what I'd look for in a wine bar. Dark lighting, cushy seating, and a feeling of coziness to drink wine and have conversation. This place does all of those things. Albeit I was here on a Rock & Roll Wine night and did not actually purchase any wine I have heard the system of actually getting the wine is unique. Being that you purchase a card and then can go to each of the "wine stations" and get your own tastings. \u000a\u000aPersonally I enjoy having my wine poured for me and brought to me, so I'm not sure if I'd actually go back and take part in the process. There is a bar here though, so you can sit and drink if you prefer. There is also food. Extremely overpriced appetizers. Seriously - if you're hungry, just leave, go to another place in The M and come back. \u000a\u000aOverall, this is an okay establishment. Definitely not one of the bests in The M for sure.

VAbsolutely excellent customer service in the archery department. \u000a\u000aMy husband and I were shopping around for kayaks and boats yesterday afternoon. We ran all over the valley to many different sporting goods stores. Normally we would not trek so far out to where Sportsman's Warehouse is located, but we did anyway. I had never been to this location before.\u000a\u000aOverall it is quite large, there are two levels, however not much is to be found on level two save for a few kayaks and boats. Mainly here you are going to find camping, fishing, and hunting equipment. \u000a\u000aThe biggest chunk of our visit was spent in the archery department where we both actually ended up purchasing our first bow and arrow sets. The two men working in this department were incredibly knowledgeable and helpful in every aspect of our purchase. We were both able to try out bows and shoot arrows. Then the two employees fitted our bows to our exact needs. We also went over all the practical things we were going to have to have to start out and they gave us many pointers on how to get started. \u000a\u000aAfter all was said and done we were allowed to go back and shoot our bows again and given some instruction. They also gave us helpful hints on where to go shoot. And we were given passes to the Clark County Range at the end of our purchase. We were there for a little over 2 hours and not once did I get the feeling we were unwelcome. We were even there a little past the time the store closed, but no employees seemed upset we had to be there a little longer than usual. \u000a\u000aI think Sporstman's Warehouse definitely hires people who KNOW what they are talking about and are experts in what they do. This is a nice change from some stores who shall remain nameless that do the exact opposite. I am sure my husband and I will be back here for any needs we may have with archery or even other sports related things.

VHoly nom nom! \u000a\u000aYesterday I was working with Anthony, he is a friend of those who own Carlito's and he was talking the place up and how he often opens his own BBQ outside the stores sometimes and they do off-menu items from his grill. Well, he made us all really want Mexican food so we called in an order.\u000a\u000aTuesdays = $1 Tacos (ground beef) or $2 for carne asada upgrade\u000a\u000aI decided to get a plate of the tacos. I was a little skeptical because whenever I hear $1 taco and ground beef in the same sentence I'm thinking greasy, runny, yucky meat with a pinch of lettuce. I was wrong. Carlito's does ground beef tacos RIGHT. The ground beef had an amazing taste and was not greasy at all. There was plenty of fresh shredded lettuce and chopped tomatoes. And even though we had to send our friend to go get the food, it was still amazing after having to take a ride back to our place of work.\u000a\u000aThey also supplemented us with a bunch of tortilla chips, red salsa, salsa verde, AND guacamole!!! Okay, the guac was frigging amazing... AMAZING!!!! \u000a\u000aI can't wait to go to the actual store. I want to have the adovada burrito. And I will be going to try out their breakfast as well.\u000a\u000aWow, this place just blew me away. So fresh, fresh! Yummers!

VUpdate because I have an obsession with Carlito's Burritos now. \u000a\u000aSince having Carlito's many moons ago I have since been back quite a few times regularly, at least once a week, maybe missing a week in between a few times. But this has definitely become a go-to establishment for me now. I must admit, I think it had replaced my Chipotle cravings! Chipotle is completely different from this place though.\u000a\u000aFirst off always get the calabacitas in whatever you order, if you don't then you might as well go somewhere else - they are the point of this place. The green/red chili sauces are also phenomenal, but the calabacitas are what you come here for. I always get them in my burritos (my natural go-to). I have had the steak (tender, often charred just a bit), the chicken, and of course, the best, the adovada pork. \u000a\u000aYou have the option to get your burrito smothered, which I have done once, but never again. It is not my thing, but others may like this option. The green chili sauce has a KICK and the red is pleasantly spicy. \u000a\u000aThe service is always good and the employees are nice. The place is small, so be prepared to wiggle through tables and possibly not be able to eat in the restaurant if it's packed. I suggest eating at the small bar area if you are alone or only with another person. This way you get to watch the cooks because the kitchen is completely open and you can see everything getting cooked and served up.\u000a\u000aThis is awesome New Mexican cuisine. Don't miss out on this place.

VI've been re-living in Las Vegas for three years and just very recently went down to City Center (specifically Crystals because it was the only place I had the strength/patience to walk through). I happened to be down at the Cosmo with an out of town friend and suggested we check out the mall because it was close.\u000a\u000aWhat can I say to Crystals? "BOO, YOU WHORE."\u000a\u000aWhen Las Vegas was going bust and City Center was on the verge of bankruptcy and Harry Reid put in his calls to whoever the hell he calls to make sure this place still got built - and THIS is what it ends up being? Another Forums Shop? Except with some creeper cage restaurant in the middle of it? It looks like one of those motorcycle-cages you see at country bumpkin fairs, except it's in the middle of a bunch of high-end stores that no one is shopping at.\u000a\u000aNo. One. Is. Shopping. Here. My friend and I walked all the way through and back to the Cosmo through this place and we probably counted 10 people in the stores. COME ON. What a waste of air conditioning. \u000a\u000aMaybe 30 years from now when Americans (like myself) finally have jobs again there will be people in here, but for now it looks like an abandoned tourist trap that's been very well-kept.\u000a\u000aFor all the hype City Center put in this place it is obvious they were living in LA-LA Land while the American economy was crumbling around them. And now the crumbled American worker trucks through this place wondering how the frack to get out.

V*** This review is based on HAPPY HOUR ***\u000a\u000aBe warned: If you come here for their happy hour and plan on being satisfied with just two plates (or even three) you will be sorely disappointed. The drinks specials are better than the food, but even then, they're a bit steep if you're coming for cocktails ($7) and they are very limited as there were only three specialty cocktails on the menu when I went last night.\u000a\u000aMy friends and I visited on a Tuesday night, right at 5 PM. That is the time HH starts and the time American Fish opens. You may have a tough time finding the restaurant as it is on the second level of Aria, by the Zarkana theaters. I simply asked for directions after getting lost once. I don't like wandering casino floors anymore, reminds me of when I used to get drunk at clubs.\u000a\u000aThe space is awesome, one of the best concepts for a restaurant I've ever seen. Behind the bar is beautiful mural of trees, over the dining area is a gorgeous blue ceiling. The vibe is kind of loud, but not loud enough that it is annoying at the bar area. \u000a\u000aAs for food, we dined on the HH specials, which at least, the bartender did warn us would be small. Boy was he right. I got the following:\u000a\u000aLobster Roll: You get two, very tiny bite-sized lobster crackers. Except it's not crackers, they are actually rectangles of bread. Although the lobster was delicious, it was teeny.\u000a\u000aFries: I shared my friend's. This is probably the best bang for your buck on the HH menu, but honestly paying $5 for fries is way too much anyway. \u000a\u000aBeef Tartare: I'd never had beef tartare before, so I figured why not try it? It comes out in a bowl, with the beef sliced into the tiniest of squares, comes with a bready crouton. I enjoyed it.\u000a\u000aKing Crab Louie: I was still hungry after all that so I ordered what is basically a refined deviled egg. You get two, the crab concoction is stuffed inside the egg and it is deviled, plain and simple, yet I'm glad I got this dish because I loved it. I plan to recreate it sometime on my own at home for a party.\u000a\u000aOverall, it is not the best, nor is it the worst HH in town. Of course it is in the Aria, so you have to take that into account. Get ready to spend the bucks or else be disappointed. Although the quality was there I just think the restaurant could afford to add a bit to the portions, come now, at least three lobster "rolls" if they're going to be less than the size of my pinky finger!\u000a\u000aI would love to go back for dinner some day, but I would have to save some of my monies to do it since the pricing here is steep.

VI have no intention to return to Scarpetta after having dined there last night on the pre-fixe menu for Restaurant Week. First I will state what is warranting the one star: a wonderful Chianti and delicious heirloom tomatoes. \u000a\u000aThis is what I was served:\u000a\u000aHeirloom Tomato Salad - I thought the presentation was lovely and all the flavors were good and spread out. The heirloom tomatoes were very tasty. I was not disappointed with this dish.\u000a\u000aAged Sirloin Beef; Potato Gnocchi, Wild Mushrooms, Parmigiano & Barolo Ragu - I am fairly certain my dish did not have ANY mushrooms in it and I was very disappointed in this fact. Was it because we were dining on the RW menu? I guess mushrooms only go to those paying full price? The sirloin was O.K.. nothing special. I will admit the waiter suggested I get it medium and I opted for medium-well, maybe my mistake here - but the fact the meat had quite a bit of fat on it and gristle was NOT my fault.\u000a\u000aAmadei Chocolate Cake Toasted Almond Gelato & Salted Caramel Sauce - The cake was very rich and I was pleased with it, however I felt as though it was something that could be served up at an Applebee's for goodness sake, not a fine dining establishment.\u000a\u000aOn to the even worse (because the food was actually okay) was the service. Our waiter was horrid. Just absolutely, down-right inattentive and spaced out beyond belief. He was an older gentlemen. Mistakes made:\u000a\u000a- Incredibly slow service\u000a- Offering us a wine menu, but not taking our wine order until we gave it to him ourselves\u000a- The wine took forever to arrive and in the mean time he did not return to take our meal orders\u000a- Had tap water poured into our water cups that were filled with the water we PAID FOR\u000a- He did a poor-ass job of describing the meals, as did the others serving us\u000a- Just the most bland service EVER; did not ask us how our food was, did not chat with us at all, just did not care in general\u000a\u000aWas it because we were there on the RW Menu? Maybe. And if that is the way an establishment runs a wonderful event for a good cause for a charity than I have absolutely no intention of ever returning to order off the menu. There are better places I can go in Vegas to have fine Italian dining. Scarpetta is not one of them.

VMy cousin plus her married couple friends were in town the past few days. My husband and I met up with them Downtown to enjoy Fremont Street and to get some quick, cheap "old Vegas style" dinner. We meandered around trying to find a steak and lobster special, but we realized that deal didn't happen until 9 PM and we were hungry. \u000a\u000aWe noticed the "9.95" prime rib special at Magnolia's, which is located in the Four Queens so we decided, hey why not. The place is definitely old school. But it's also a casino cafe trying desperately to be kind of like a diner. It's odd. Either be a cafe or a diner. There is a subtle difference and Magnolia's does not blend it well. Also, Magnolia's offers Hawaiian food, which I was surprised by - a Hawaiian skirt steak special and a Loco Moco. Interesting.\u000a\u000aAlso of note is the fact that we were definitely the youngest people there by far. I had to navigate around walkers to get through the entrance. No, I am not joking or being funny. Seriously. I had to walk around walkers to get to my table.\u000a\u000aOnward - the food.\u000a\u000aAll of us ordered the same thing - Prime Rib Special, which comes with a potato side and a serving vegetables. It was green beans when we were there. I ordered mine medium and it came out decent. There was quite a bit of fat, but overall the meat was not bad. It is certainly a lot food. I did not finish my plate. In fact, none of us did. So, for the price, I guess it is worth it if you are looking for that Vegas-y cheap protein meal type thing. \u000a\u000aBEWARE - you only get the special pricing if you have a player's club card, which none of us had until we specifically asked if we were getting the right price. Had we not asked, we would have never known and would have been charged $11.95. Lame. Why not just come out and say it? You have to have a player's club card prime rib. There. \u000a\u000aService - Pretty dang bad. Hence my super low rating. Paired with the ambiance and the oldness of the place and the "eh, okay food". But man, service was weird. Our server was nice, but we could barely understand him. Our drinks weren't refilled and we were brought our lemons instead of limes on two occasions. Lastly, the cashier was horribly rude when we went up and asked to split the check. She kept saying, "You want to split down the middle?" And we were like, no. We want it completely split. Look, it was only five people not 15. Split the freaking check! She also snatched the receipt out of my hand twice during the process.\u000a\u000aI could forgive Magnolia's for being old and just take it as what it is - an old Vegas restaurant, it's an experience! But the service and haughty attitude of the cashier and the hostess was really off-putting. If you're going to run this kind of establishment where your food is mediocre, your service could at least be nicer. Just my two cents.

VI love wine. I love rock and roll. \u000a\u000aRock and Roll Wine is one of the best on-going events in Las Vegas in my opinion. I was introduced to them through Yelp events and I have gone back numerous times since. I saw one of my very, very favorite bands at a Rock and Roll Wine event (OK Go). Plus RnRwine introduces me to new venues I have never been to in Las Vegas and may not have gone to otherwise.\u000a\u000aEven if you don't like wine I think the concerts are worth it. Plus the wines are typically very good wines. At  the last event I went to at Hostile Grape I had one of the best red wines I've ever had in my entire life. I swear it to be true!\u000a\u000aI am very excited for the Amplified concert featuring Train at Mandalay Beach next month! Oh and on top of all this, Chris Hammond, the President is a very cool guy. I won tickets to the Amplified event and he was very courteous and quick about getting me my tickets. :)

VWhy did I even bother?\u000a\u000aSometimes after work, especially when I work overtime I am simply hungry and nothing is open because I get off of work at 12:30 AM. I was starving and did not feel like cooking when I got home. I happened to remember Carl's Jr. also sells burritos under their "Green Burrito" name so I thought I would just try it this once.\u000a\u000aWell, it just so happened that night they weren't actually selling any of the Mexican food. Bummer. And I was already IN the drive-thru, sitting there with my stomach rumbling still. I decided to go with the Carl's Jr. Six Dollar Burger combo, bringing my total to a whopping $8.68. I don't know about other people, but paying anything over 6 bucks for something someone is handing me through a window never sits well with me.\u000a\u000aAnd surprise - the burger didn't sit well with me either. I got home and the fries were incredibly sub-par. Just sad ass fries in general. I didn't bother eating very many of them. But my dogs enjoyed them. The cheeseburger - such a joke! I can't believe people fall for this "it's like a restaurant burger" crap. I guess if you've never been to a restaurant and had a burger then...\u000a\u000aAnyway the cheeseburger from the minute I picked it up was slip-sliding everywhere. Why? Because there was massive amounts of mayo and mustard sliming up the works. I had to undo the burger, pick out everything, scrape off a majority of the sauces, throw out the mealy tomato, and THEN have the actual burger. They say it's "Angus beef" - okay. Maybe it tasted a BIT better than normal fast food burgers, but really? NOPE.. \u000a\u000aI'd rather have McDonald's guys. At least the fries are better.

VI went to Murphy's Law on the day after St. Patrick's Day. Went here because it was my father's birthday and all he had requested for his birthday was to eat their deep-friend Reuben Balls. They're actually called "Round Reubens" in the menu, I believe.\u000a\u000aWhen my mother, father, and I got there we sat down at the bar to have a few drinks first. The place has your normal bar feel. It wasn't so much an "Irish Pub" ambiance though, which is kind of what I was expected. It's okay they did have a lot of Irish beer on the menu. I ordered a Smithwicks, my mother a coke, and my father, a Bud Light (I know, they're lame). Anyway, we ended up playing the machines for a bit and they had March Madness basketball playing on the televisions. Looks as though they are quite up-to-date about their sports, so if you're looking for a place to go watch the game, then this place is probably right up your alley. Also, about 30 minutes into us being there, the bartender went around and changed pretty much every television in the place to the UNLV basketball game (which I could have cared less because #1 I don't like basketball and #2 I went to UNR). \u000a\u000aThe bartenders were especially nice and I really liked that they were sociable. Seemed as though they had plenty of regulars, but they did not ignore people like myself, who had never been there before. Now on to the food! \u000a\u000aMy dad ordered the Round Reubens. My mother and I opted for the Cheeseburger Cheeseburger. I was slightly disappointed in the menu - I was expecting at least a couple menu items to be Irish food. But alas - the menu is just a bar menu, nothing more, nothing less. Upon receiving our food my mother and I came to the realization our Cheeseburger Cheeseburgers were in fact DOUBLE cheeseburgers. "Duh" I thought, "that's why it's called a Cheeseburger Cheeseburger in the menu", but being that I did not read the description - I had no idea! Even though it was WAY too much for me to eat, it was tasty, and they cooked it Medium, which is the way I ordered it and actually did come medium - kudos to them for that. As for the reuben balls, I did have one and it was really good, but oh my goodness it was RICH. I would only be able to eat ONE and the dish comes with SIX! My dad did not even finish it. But I would assume it would be really, really good drunk food after a night of drinking. \u000a\u000aSo overall my impression is this: it's a good BAR with good bartenders, food-wise: not much to choose from, but it is good food, seems to be sporty-themed, and it is obviously a UNLV hang-out place.

VMy boyfriend has an obsession with Walmart because he is from the Midwest and apparently you go to Walmart alot in the Midwest. I am assuming that's because there is nothing else to do.\u000a\u000aAnyway, I'm just kidding about that part. But him and I ended up driving incredibly far out to this Walmart because we really had nothing better to do, but we needed to buy supplies for Super Bowl Sunday. \u000a\u000aThere are few negatives and a few positives. First off, there is a Sonic in this Walmart, so there's a positive. It is clean, the aisles are big. \u000a\u000aHowever, when we were there the store had been CLEANED OUT. Especially the produce section. There were no limes. Very few onions. A sparse collection of sour cream. I am assuming this is all because people were buying for Super Bowl. But it's Walmart... I feel as though this shopping giant should be able to accommodate and prepare for such a rush of people. Hence the 3-Star rating.

VI gotta say Famous Dave's disappointed me last night. I was all revved up from goin out shootin in the desert with my fiance and we got stuck in Nascar traffic on the way back home. Needless to say, we were starved after being in the desert and then having to sit through traffic like that!\u000a\u000aWe decided on Famous Dave's, which I have been to before and I remember it being pretty dang good. However, I think maybe Famous Dave's has lost its glimmer of BBQ goodness to me. Maybe it's because I've had better BBQ elsewhere...\u000a\u000aWe split the 2-person plate, which is half a rack of ribs, beef brisket, chicken, 2 cornbread muffins, 2 corncobs, and a crap-ton of potato wedges. The wedges were taking up half the plate! Oh, you also get baked beans and coleslaw. So how did all this food stack up?\u000a\u000aRibs - 3/5 \u000aYikes. Yes, I know. Although they did have a nice pink smoke to them, they were not very tender, and much of the meat would not come off the bone without a lot of gnawing. \u000a\u000aBeef Brisket - 2/5\u000aSALTY SALTY SALTY. Oh and not to mention way too much fat. For a BBQ joint I'm surprised they don't select better meat.\u000a\u000aChicken - 2/5\u000aI just did not like the seasoning on this chicken and compared with the other meats on the plate, it just seemed out of place. It wasn't cooked very well either. Just meh.\u000a\u000aSides - 3/5\u000aWedges were tasty, but way too many. Beans were pretty good. Cornbread muffins were tasty and sweet, and the corn on the cob was actually perfect. They also served the tasty little BBQ chips so you can taste test the sauces with them. \u000a\u000aSauces - 4/5\u000aFor some reason FD's is doing an awesome job with sauces, but not so much their meat. I mean, I LOVE their sauces, especially the Devil's Spit and the Texas one.\u000a\u000aOverall - 3/5\u000aIt's okay. But for a BBQ joint... eh, it's just missing that kick, it's missing that fall off the bone wonderfulness you expect.

VSorry and I hate to give Sephora this rating but my experience today left a lot to be desired.\u000a\u000aI went to Sephora in search of quite a few items. I'm starting a new job so I wanted to update my makeup stash. I've been existing off of drug store brands for awhile now but my new job requires me to be not just presentable, but polished. So. I wanted to completely revamp my makeup collection. The funny thing is I came here ready to lay down some serious cash but....\u000a\u000aThere were PLENTY of employees working here but not one of them greeted me. I walked the aisles, mostly looking at Smashbox and NARS. I wanted a kit and kaboodle type purchase. IE: Concealer, foundation, powder, and a finisher. Unfortunately no employee came around to help me. I even had one girl walk by me, say nothing, and then greet another customer.\u000a\u000aAt that point I decided to just go with what I had seen on YouTube videos. I tested concealers/foundations on the back of my hand until I found a match. Then I wandered to the Clinique section and selected a mascara. I also decides on a new eye-liner by Urban Decay based off of a "review of eyeliners" I pulled up while in the store.\u000a\u000aI spent a good hour here without ANY help from an employee AND I left with $90 worth of makeup.\u000a\u000aHonestly I could have done this kind of shopping online since I did it all myself anyway. Unfortunately there's no way to compare skin tone and foundation online.\u000a\u000aSo - my thanks for this makeup rejuvenation mostly goes to makeup artists of YouTube 90% and 10% goes to Sephora for being the place I could go make my purchases.

V*** REVIEW IS FOR LV RESTAURANT WEEK 2013 ***\u000a\u000aI have been meaning to visit Julian Serrano for awhile. After all, for all food connoisseurs in Las Vegas, surely Julian Serrano must be somewhere on their list. Tucked away inside the alluring Aria by the front desk, yet ever so far away from parking garage is this spot of expensive tapas paradise. To be of note - it IS a tapas place, hence why I haven't been on pins and needles trying to come here. Always in the back of my mind was the voice saying, "So expensive for just tapas! Just go to Firefly instead!"\u000a\u000aLuckily LVRW2013 has rolled around and I enjoyed a meal here with friends on a Tuesday night at 6:30 PM. Before being seated my friend and I ordered cocktails at the bar (all $14). I tried a fruity type drink that provided a nice start to my meal. Not too sweet, not too alcoholy, but still pretty steep in price. After drinks we were seated in the dining area further back, which is nice since it is over carpet, which brings the sound of the clacking of feet down to a minimum and it also hides your table from the casino. Chairs are plush and comfortable, lighting is perfect, and the ambiance is classy. \u000a\u000aService was excellent. Our server was prompt, kept our drinks filled, and in general was a very courteous gentleman. I ordered a chardonnay from the Bordeaux region of France ($16). A lovely wine indeed and of the two options (another which was from California) I am glad I splurged. Worth every drop.  \u000a\u000aOn to the food...\u000a\u000aChicken Croquetas - Simple yet tasty is the best way to describe these. The dish is not the most pleasant to look at, but the taste was deliciously fried on the outside and creamy on the inside.\u000a\u000aSalmon (with mashed potatoes and baby carrots) - The main dish is what let me down and which brought down my rating. The salmon was cooked well enough, but the portion size was disappointing. My friend got the chicken and after seeing her dish I was wishing for chicken. Also, the horseradish cream served on the side of the salmon just did not go well with the fish, to me personally. I am wishing now someone else in my party had wanted to do the paella, but in order to have that option you must have more than one person ordering the dish. *womp womp*\u000a\u000aMolten Chocolate Cake and Blood Orange Ice Cream - I do love blood orange ice cream and sorbet and this one was refreshing to have with the very decadent and very good chocolate cake. If anything, this may have been my favorite part of the dining experience, coming in second to the glass of chardonnay.\u000a\u000aOverall - I realize I am reviewing the LVRW2013 menu, but even so, this food reflects the establishment. I think the big thing was how flat the salmon fell for me. After all, it was my main dish. While the other items were good I believe they should have been better considering the establishment. \u000a\u000aWould I be back? I would try happy hour. I would even go back for a birthday party I was invited to here... or some other special event. BUT, I do not believe I would come back for a full-out full-priced meal.

VMotor City is located in a strip mall off Paradise. You'll miss it if you're not looking for it, as it is lost in the sea of neon signs. It's a typical Las Vegas bar, although it does have a stage area with seating. \u000a\u000aThey do a lot of live music, and currently have a new bartender who is booking shows. I know her, as she is my very good friend!\u000a\u000aOverall, this is a cool place to grab a drink, usually very quiet during the day and kind of busy at night and on the weekends. if you're looking for live music (metal, punk, etc) head down here.

VI like Dick's Sporting Goods over a lot of other sports stores in Las Vegas. I think we all know retail stores don't do a good job at keeping up with what you can get online. However, there are those times you just have to go retail. You have no other choice. So, when I realized I needed a new sleeping bag ASAP I headed to Dick's. \u000a\u000aLucky me, oh lucky day. The day I went they were having a sale on camping goods AND sleeping bags. I ended up purchasing a sleeping bag that can take 20 degree temps for only about $50. Now, if you're not into camping, you may not know this, but sleeping bags that will keep you warm the colder it gets means the price gets higher the colder the bag can withstand. Being that this was a 20 degree bag (mummy style), and it came with a great carrying case with a handle, I'd say I made a damn good deal that day.\u000a\u000aThe great thing about Dick's is location as well. It is connected to the Galleria Mall. Also, they offer an extensive line of products for numerous activities. Camping, fishing, running, shooting, exercising, kayaking, and they have a large selection of exercise and outdoor wear. I think Dick's beats out quite a few stores (except maybe REI) in the clothing section.\u000a\u000aThe cashier who checked me out was also super friendly as well. So they get a gold star for customer service as well.

VAmazing! Worth every penny I paid to make me gorgeous for my wedding day! \u000a\u000aI booked an appointment with Glamsquad when I knew I would rather have the makeup and hair come to ME on my wedding day. I am so thrilled I went with Glamsquad. They arrived on time, were very nice, and they even added on doing my mother's hair even though we had originally only planned to have her makeup done.\u000a\u000aThree gentleman arrived to work on myself, my two nieces, my mother, and my sister. First went my little nieces who got cute updos and age apropriate makeup for the day. My sister had her hair and makeup done as well. \u000a\u000aMy hairstylist also did my airbrush makeup and it was phenomenal! I must say the airbrush is totally worth it, especially if you are the bride, because you will have so many pictures taken on your wedding day. My skin looked almost flawless in all my pics, even though I had been stressing and breaking out before the wedding.\u000a\u000aI can't give enough thanks to Glamsquad for making me beautiful on my wedding day and for making my sister, mother, and nieces look gorgeous too.  Seriously ladies, if you want to look good on your wedding day go with Glamsquad!

VAs I sit in the foyer of the Chelsea Ballroom inside the Cosmopolitan, I am writing this review. I have been working here as an independent contractor at a conference for the past three days. I have been exposed to the staff here and the casino itself in numerous ways. I also had the opportunity to visit the pool area and attend a free event that involved pool, foosball, ping pong, and free drinks. I must say, The Cosmopolitan has a lot going for it. There are a few stand out occurrences I would like to mention.\u000a\u000aFirst, I want to applaud the staff of the Cosmo, in particular their staff that handles issues regarding the phone lines and setting up the conference rooms for clients. The client I was working for was experiencing difficulties getting a credit card machine to work. The Cosmo's staff worked diligently on the problem until it was fixed. I even overheard one of the staff members on his phone saying, "what can I do to get this client's problem fixed within the next hour?" Also, the sales manager (I believe) even came down to deal with the issue personally until it was fixed. As for another note on the staff: they are friendly and engaging and seem to really enjoy working here.  \u000a\u000aThe casino itself is very nice to look at. It smells nice and new. The abundance of seating is fantastic. The Chandelier Bar is beautiful and the secret pizzeria is a delight, especially for locals.\u000a\u000aMy only complaint at this point in time is perhaps th strange player's club catalog you receive once you sign up for the club. It's stark and boring compared to the elegant nature of the casino. My father thought it was a financial advising pamphlet, rather than a pamphlet explaining a casino's player's club. Also, *some* of the art hanging around is somewhat questionable to me. There was a certain piece that looked like cheaply wrapped Christmas gifts in the foyer of the Chelsea ballroom. But I shouldn't be so overly critical.  \u000a\u000aAll in all I love the Cosmo. I would actually love to stay here just to see what their hotel rooms are like. Good job Cosmo! You know how to step up the game in Las Vegas!\u000a\u000aPS - what is the deal with the weird circle of dog statues on the 3rd floor???

VThis is my review of mine and my husband's experience for my birthday on May 1st, 2013. I am upset to give The Cosmo a two star review, but based on my experience with the check-in process and having a suite here I cannot give anymore. I have been a fan of Cosmo since it opened. I've spent a lot of money here. I'm a local and I sing its praises to out of towners all the time. But I will NOT be recommending for any of my friends (local or otherwise) to actually stay here.\u000a\u000aWe arrived early (just about an hour) prior to check-in time and we were greeted by a very nice, chipper young lady who set about getting our information. First off, we had just made the reservation the day before, so we were absolutely sure it was there. The girl typed in our name repeatedly to no avail. My husband whipped out his phone and showed her our email confirmation so she could look it up by the confirmation number instead. TA-DA. There it was with our last name misspelled. Hurray. At least we were smart enough to bring our confirmation with us or else they probably never would have found our reservation to begin with. \u000a\u000aThey have our reservation for the Terrace Suite for one night. She asks us if we're there for business or pleasure and I say it's my birthday and we're locals and we just wanted to get a room for the night and play by the pool. She seems okay with that and continues tapping away, then she excuses herself and brings forth some other guy in a suit. O HAI guy in a suit, what do you want? He introduces himself and shakes mine and my husband's hand. He then proceeds to chastise us and shame-shame us for being locals and getting a hotel room for a night.\u000a\u000a"It's our policy to inform locals that our rooms are not meant for loud, raging parties. We expect you to be courteous to the other guests. After all, there are plenty of other places to have a good time here in the resort."\u000a\u000aOH. OKAY GUY IN SUIT. I'll try not to have a raging balls-to-the-wall party in my room since you've wagged your finger in my face before I even check in.\u000a\u000aWhat gets me is that he specifically said it's policy for them to inform LOCALS. Because, well, guess what locals? Cosmo doesn't want your business if you're just there for a night for your birthday with your husband trying to enjoy a suite and have dinner with your friends. Seriously. I was so incensed by this guy I didn't know what to do besides awkwardly laugh at his remarks.\u000a\u000aHe then goes on to ask if we're "in the industry". \u000a\u000aNo. I reply. I work for the federal government and my husband is Air Force. \u000a\u000a"OOOOH" says guy in suit, "Thank you for your service."\u000a\u000aYAH. Fuck you. You were just giving us a lesson in how we should conduct ourselves in our room that we're paying good money for, GUY IN SUIT. How about you fuck off with your "thank you for your service".\u000a\u000aI've never been treated that way when I've checked into any hotel before on the strip. I've never been shamed because I'm a local. I've never been given a talking to by some random guy just because I happen to be local and I happen to just be getting a suite for the night. I think it was ridiculous. I think it was rude. And I think The Cosmo does a whole lot of assuming about their guests.\u000a\u000aWell I guess my young appearance my tattoos must have just sent alarm bells ringing up the asses of these people.\u000a\u000aSo our check-in process basically sucked and I am sad to report how far it dropped The Cosmo in my eyes.\u000a\u000aOur room - Terrace Suite, 28th floor, facing the Bellagio Fountains. Amazing room, full kitchen, living area, wrap around suite, plush bed, interesting artwork. Lighting that goes completely on and off when you leave the suite. A tub that could have been much bigger in my opinion and a decent enough bathroom. We didn't call for room service, so can't comment. \u000a\u000aWe DID have my 4 friends come up to the suite AFTER we had dinner. We all fuckin jumped all over the beds and turned over tables and lit a fire in the trash can and brought in a fuckin tiger from Sig & Roy's Magical Garden and we fucked that place up. OH JUST KIDDING. We watched the fountain show, hung out, had champagne, talked, and had my birthday cake while I opened presents. Afterward my LOCAL CRAZY MUTHER EFFING FRIENDS left and my husband and I watched TV and went to bed. OH MAH GAWD.\u000a\u000aAnyway, that's my experience at The Cosmo. Not so good, eh? Dearest locals - go elsewhere, lest you be chastised before you even get a chance to enjoy.

VThis location is super convenient for me because it is the closest place to my house to get froyo. Unfortunately it does not stack up against the better froyo places around the valley such as Yogurtland.\u000a\u000aIt's not bad, it's usually clean and it has that yogurt-place smell to it. The toppings are always filled and available. Sometimes their selection of yogurts is disappointing, but I keep returning even so. But again, it's the convenience factor working there.\u000a\u000aOften the place can be over-run with ghetto teenagers squealing and wheeling about doing stupid teenager things, but if you're just running in and running right back out you won't need to deal with it. Therefore I never stay here to eat my yogurt. \u000a\u000aAll in all, it's okay, but nothing special.

VMama mia... \u000a\u000aI like pizza, I eat a lot of it. Am I the only one? Didn't think so. \u000a\u000aStopped by this Grimaldi's right around lunch time after my friends and I had tuckered ourselves out shopping for Christmas goodies around Boca Park. We were very hungry with visions of pizzas dancing in our heads as wen entered the rustic-looking establishment. It is not huge, nor is it small. The wooden tables and wooden decor all around make a nice, cozy feeling. I caught a glimpse of the lighting above, which are wine bottle hung from the ceiling - loved it!\u000a\u000aAs for the menu, it's straight up simple here so don't come looking for anything other than pizza, salad, or a calzone. There were no appetizers on the menu, to which I was slightly disappointed. This may be different at dinner, but I can't be sure.\u000a\u000aEverything here is pretty much build your own pizza, which I think is pretty cool. We started with the white garlic pizza (large), added grilled chicken, fresh Roma tomatoes, fresh basil, and for a nice spicy kick - jalapenos. Often times I think fresh tomatoes on pizzas make them soggy and gross, but luckily this one did not.\u000a\u000aThe pizza came out relatively fast; it is a nice, crispy, thin pizza, with a bubbly, brown, crunchy crust. I am not a pizza-connoisseur so I am not sure what "style" this may be, but I enjoyed it. I think we got just the right amount of toppings, anymore and the poor pizza would not have withheld them.\u000a\u000aMy suggestions: come if you want PIZZA, straight up, nothing else. Build your own and experiment with toppings. BUT - do not go crazy, I'd say, 3 *maybe* 4 toppings at the most and make sure you're putting stuff on there that makes sense.\u000a\u000aOverall I was pleased, between the three of us we got an amazing pizza, plenty of toppings, and splitting the bill we each owed UNDER $10. Yes. That's a damn good deal. Of course, remember, there were three of us splitting a large, so prices may vary! I will definitely come back here to try some more styles and toppings.

VI am not big into motorcycle or ATVs, etc. However, my husband is, therefore I have been to Ridenow on a few occasions. On our last trip we went to look at ATVs. Usually these trips are just to satiate my husband's desire to look at what he refers to as his "toys".\u000a\u000aOverall the store is in good shape and it's clean, bright, and large. You can browse and walk around easily to look at all the merchandise. \u000a\u000aDownside is - customer service isn't that great. Although we are often greeted no sales person really asks what we're looking for. Perhaps they just wait for you to come to them... not sure.\u000a\u000aAnother downside - their ATVs seem to be older models. My husband noted they did not have any of the newer ones he had been looking at online. \u000a\u000aWe've never actually bought anything here so I can't comment on a purchasing process. Maybe sometime in the future we will actually buy something here, until then the 3 star rating will do.

VI felt the need to write up a quick review of my neighborhood Wal-Mart Market. \u000a\u000aI go here primarily when I realize I have run out of something in the middle of cooking or baking. Take for instance yesterday I was baking cupcakes and halfway through the process realized I would not have enough baking soda to coincide with the recipe. A quick trip to this Wal Mart and I was set with what I needed.\u000a\u000aI would never complete an entire grocery shopping trip here. It's small and choices are limited. However, it still boasts a deli section and even a small area with baked goods. It's like your normal Wal-Mart, just simply scaled back, and obviously it is just a grocery store (pharmacy products included).\u000a\u000aI've found it to be decent, but the employees are sometimes less than congenial. I tend to avoid that by going through the self check. Most irking of all is the fact that the employees sit outside on benches right in front of the store and smoke like chimneys. I get it, people need to smoke, and I am not a person parading against getting people to quit, but it's just kind of gross to see. That's why typically "smoking areas" for employees are reserved for the back of the building and away from the eyes of customers. Just my two cents.

VI used to L-O-V-E Golden Spoon! Did you know they were around in Vegas many, many years ago? They had a few locations here in the 90s, but then shut down halfway through my sophomore year of high school (that was 1999/2000). The one near my house got replaced by a Dairy Queen. So, to my great astonishment Golden Spoon returned to the valley! Except, there is not one anywhere close to where I live. *tear*\u000a\u000aThis one out in Henderson I have frequented a few times. I still like their yogurt/ice cream... but it doesn't have that zing it used to have when I was a little kid. It's like almost gelato, almost yogurt, almost ice cream, but none of those things really. Don't get me wrong, it is a good way to treat your sugar tooth, but it's not too special.\u000a\u000aI still like that they give you a golden spoon. I do not like that they still use Styrofoam cups. I'm always afraid I'm going to push my spoon too far down and end up with little cracklings of Styrofoam in my yogurt! Yuck!\u000a\u000aSizes are outrageous. I never finish mine, even when I order a small. I guess I just can't bring myself to eat that much yogurt, especially when I start thinking about where it might show up later! :O

VI LOVE THIS JAMBA!\u000a\u000aI have been here many times as it is very close to my boyfriend's apartment. Jamba Juice is yummy and healthy and it makes your feel full without that yucky feeling you get from eating sometimes. Usually I find myself literally craving a Jamba Juice smoothie and there is just no other option.\u000a\u000aJamba's are typically clean, have a wonderful smell, and the employees are chipper. This joint is no different. I have had many different smoothies here. Recently I had the orange based one (I forget the name), but it was good. Maybe a little too orangey for me. Doubt I'll get that one again. BUT the pomegranate one is aaaawesome!\u000a\u000aI also love their steel-cut oatmeal. You think you don't like oatmeal? Then go eat Jamba's oatmeal. You will think differently. You can get it topped with a few different options. Jamba is perfect for a morning kick-start: smoothie, wheat-grass shot, AND oatmeal. Can't beat that.

VThis Port of Subs is located in a very busy shopping center surrounded by corporate buildings and businesses. So beware about going during rush times 11 AM - 1 PM. I happened upon this place because it is close to the yoga studio I am currently going to. It's definitely WAAAY on the other side of town from me - but boy was I glad to find one so close to the studio! It makes for quick meal before or after my yoga class.\u000a\u000aThe staff is nice and they're quick. I love POS sandwiches and I rarely happen upon a poorly made sandwich. It has not happened to me here yet. \u000a\u000aWord of caution - the parking lot is small and the place itself is quite small. So if you do want to eat in it would be best to go AFTER the lunch and dinner rush.

VAs far as Targets go in Las Vegas this particular store in Henderson is on the "meh" side. I even prefer the Target on Maryland Parkway close to the Strip and UNLV over this location.\u000a\u000aThe cons - I feel as though the food section is lacking here. It's quite small and does not offer as many Target-brand food items as other locations. The store also often is disorganized and lacking merchandise. I especially feel as though other Targets have a larger selection of Junior/Misses clothing. \u000a\u000aThe pros - It's a Target located conveniently near many other places I often shop such as the Galleria Mall. \u000a\u000aOverall - 2 stars. Better Targets reside elsewhere in the valley, but this one will do in a pinch.

VThis particular Starbucks has incredibly nice, competent employees. On mornings when I wake up before my boyfriend and need some java this is where I go.\u000a\u000aIt's clean and efficent. There's always a nice aroma of coffee. I've been through the drive-thru as well and it can be a bit slow, but not nearly as slow as some others I have been to.\u000a\u000aAlso, their breakfast sandwiches, although overpriced (yes I know, it's Starbucks), are yummy yummy! I actually had one today, the bacon, egg, and gouda cheese. The gouda cheese definitely makes it real good. Mm hmm. \u000a\u000aGreat Starbucks location. No complaints from me.

VStrangely enough this Staples, way out in "old" Henderson off of Boulder Highway is a gem. It's located in a large, spacious strip mall with plenty of parking. \u000a\u000aThe store is clean and bright. Everything was organized and set out nicely. I never really think about going to Staples too often because I never really feel the need to spend money on office equipment. However, this Staples proved to be nicer than Office Depots I have been to.\u000a\u000aIt's really a plain store, there's nothing special about it other than the fact I find it to be a bit above the standard of Office Depots. They do sell laptops and other electronics.\u000a\u000aCheckout was quick and congenial. I even had to do a return of a tablet and there was no problem with handling the return. Although, I did have my receipt with me, which helps.\u000a\u000aOverall a very nice store with knowledgeable, helpful staff.

VIt's not a great hospital. Okay, honest to goodness I've never had a lot of visits at medical facilities. Up until I got married and put on Tricare I had only step foot in one hospital a LONG time ago and only been to UMC Quickcares because I had no health insurance.\u000a\u000aThe hospital itself is expansive and takes some getting used to to navigate. I've only been to Family Medicine for womanly checkups and of course, to the pharmacy to pick up prescriptions from said visits. I have also been in the ER because my father had to take a trip out there (by his own insistence) while he was in Vegas over a holiday. Being high ranking he got superior treatment to any treatment I or my husband has ever gotten (my husband doesn't speak too highly of this facility).\u000a\u000aOf course, since I'm basing off my experiences it's been okay, nothing spectacular and nothing to make me stop going (as if I had a choice). Medical care is hard to come by these days and I thank my lucky stars I can get seen for free and get meds for free, even though I do have to plan my appointments out 6 months in advance, and yes, I DO plan my appointments about 4-6 months out because if I don't I won't get an appointment when I want one.\u000a\u000aMain rating based on facilities, niceness of employees I've dealt with and the family/womens doctors.

VFour stars because this place, honest to goodness, has some of the cheapest diesel prices in town. Try to go anywhere else and find them lower than here. You may be able to find some further down on Nellis toward the Air Force Base, but this place has CHEAP gas.\u000a\u000aMy car runs on diesel so finding it cheap is hard to come by. Not to mention this gas station is about 5 minutes from my house. \u000a\u000aNote - you do have to pay cash to get the lowest price.

VThis Albertson's is the closest grocery store to my house if you do not count the Wal Mart Market just up the street from me. Usually I run to this Albertson's if I'm making a dish and realize I don't have all the ingredients I need. I also like going to Albertson's for produce as their fruits and veggies are always plentiful and look healthy and fresh. \u000a\u000aIn general this Albertson's has never disappointed me. They do have a pretty good liquor section with a cold area stocked with your beers and cold wines, etc, and then they have the wine cellar/hard liquor section. \u000a\u000aThe deli is okay, and the bakery has some pretty interesting offerings every now and again, but usually it's your run of the mill stuff. \u000a\u000aThis location also has a chicken wing serve yourself station set up, which I have seen before, but I have not until now gotten any wings. Today I decided to pick some up for my mother and I to have lunch. They do offer a few flavors, as well as boneless and bone-in. When I was there all the boneless were gone. So I opted for the "Zesty" and regular "Hot" wings. I was intrigued by the SALT & VINEGAR wings... say what? Yes, but I figured I'd save those for a later trip after I tried these wings. I really enjoyed the serve-yourself style because you can get as many as you want, in different flavors. Then you just take the bag to the deli person and they weigh it and price it for you - pretty cool! They also have dipping sauces available. \u000a\u000aThe wings were pretty good! Very meaty, not skimpy! I did enjoy the zesty flavor a bit more than the hot version. The sauce is also a bit sticky for my tastes, but not so much that I wouldn't eat it again. I'm liking these wings and I will definitely be getting them again.

VThis Sonic is really hit or miss all the time. This particular location happens to be on my way home from work so it is super convenient for me if I want to pick up something on the way home on the rare occasion I haven't prepped dinner before going to work. It's also helpful when the husband calls me when I'm getting out of work begging for a Sonic Blast... \u000a\u000aSometimes there is no one in the dirve-thru line and it is slow. Sometimes there are a ton of people in the drive-thru and it is slow. Sometimes I've come through super quick. Again, the consistent factor is missing. \u000a\u000aThe good thing though is that the food is still good quality for a fast food joint. I tend to think of Sonic being on the upper echelons of fast food. There are a lot of options and a lot of ways to customize your meal. Their drinks are always great, especially slushies and their Cherry Coke, which I love because they do not skimp on the Cherry flavoring.\u000a\u000aI'd rather go to a different Sonic, but since this one is on my drive home I'll probably keep partonizing it whether or not the service is slow.

VI eat Capriotti's on occasion. It is not my favorite sandwich place. Sorry, that kind of repeat customer business of mine goes to Port of Subs.\u000a\u000aThis Capriotti's is pretty much the only one located on my side of town (East Side). It happens to be located in a decent shopping center though, one that is much newer than the surrounding area. The place is SMAAAAALLLL. Although I've noticed that with quite a few Cap's. I think their main idea must be, get this sandwich and get outta here.\u000a\u000aMy fiance and I arrived here in the afternoon one day of the week and there were a few other customers. He got the Bobbie and I opted for the Philly Cheese Steak and was enticed into adding peppers - NEVER AGAIN. And never again will I order the Philly Cheese Steak! MEH! The steak was definitely overcooked and the peppers were way too overpowering. I wouldn't even order it without the peppers. I'm sticking to the Bobbie or one of their cold-cut sandwiches.\u000a\u000aOverall I like Cap's, but it is kind of on the pricey side and on more than one visit I've been kind of disappointed (not just this location).\u000a\u000aThis location was clean though and the employees were nice guys too. If I was rating just based off service, this would probably be a 4-star, but I have to take the fact that the sandwich really was not all that good into consideration.

VI spent a week temping at an office in the Wells Fargo Tower and I ate here twice. It is a little cafe that is connected to the tower and it obviously caters to all the businesses in the Howard Hughes Center business park. All the people coming here are employees from around the area. Surprisingly enough it is not super busy at Noon (lunchtime) as both times I went is was exactly Noon. However, they do appear to be a thriving take-out business. I guess most people these days just can't get out of their office, even if the place they're ordering from is just a few floors down from them.\u000a\u000aAnyway, it's a nice enough joint with seating inside and out. They have a HUGE menu considering how small the place is. There are cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches, plates (mostly Greek-origin), wraps, soups, and salads. \u000a\u000aOn the two days I went I had a hot sandwich, the Turkey Loco, which was okay, but I just did not realize it was not going to have any veggies on it all. Guess that's my own fault. Second day I had the gyro salad. Basically gyro meat on a bed of lettuce, but it also comes with a dressing and tzatziki sauce, cucumbers, tomatos, and red and green peppers - yum!\u000a\u000aI suggest going with the salads here because you get the most bang for your buck. The salads are generous and since you're paying so much (everything here is $6+) you might as well get the most out of it! \u000a\u000aNot too many people are going to just come here because they want a bite to eat, but if you find yourself working in the Howard Hughes Center this place will definitely do.

VDropped in at Hussong's for a dinner on a Saturday night with my husband, his aunt and her boyfriend. The aunt and her boyfriend had actually already been to Hussong's and wanted us to try the place out. They're out-of-towners - taking us locals to a place! Ha!\u000a\u000aThe place is in Mandalay Shoppes next to one of my faves - Burger Bar. The place itself is small and narrow (also kind of like Burger Bar). And the tables are kind of close together, plus the place is a little cramped. More than a few times I felt like I needed to duck or scooch out of the way of servers trying to get food to other tables.\u000a\u000aWe started with chips (two salsas - red, which is a very tomato-based salsa, and a green tomatillo salsa which had a bit of a kick, but not much). Thank goodness we opted to get a side of guac to dip the chips in. It saved the day! It had nice, big chunks of avocado in it, which made happy. \u000a\u000aI had the Enchilada Suizas. Chicken enchiladas with tomatillo sauce, sour cream, and (I think) basil leaves topped on them. Also comes with a side of beans and rice. Strangely enough, I was a fan of the beans. Usually I am not at Mexican places, but these beans I actually liked. They had more texture and chunks of beans than others I have had. The rice was pretty bland - nothing special. The enchiladas were quite refreshing because they were much different than others I have had. With the addition of the topping of basil leaves, it made this dish much more complex and the chicken was not shredded, it was more like large, moist pieces of chicken in the enchiladas.\u000a\u000aMy husband had the carnitas platter, which comes with tortillas, peppers, onions, pickled onions, and a few other things. I tried some of the carnita and it was delish. They put a nice char on the meat and it actually comes out in CHUNKS, not shredded like so many other Mexican places. \u000a\u000aWe ended the meal with sopapillas. They come with a small dollop of caramel ice cream and chipotle honey dipping sauce. You only get TWO sopapillas in the order. They were okay, but Lindo Michocan has better sopapillas.\u000a\u000aOverall I enjoyed the experience. The only complaints are the small space, crowded seating, and the kind of bland chips and salsa. The prices were not bad for STRIP prices.

VI love fresh produce and farmer's markets. This one is a bit on the small side compared to many markets I have been to, but it's okay. This is a new venture for Las Vegas so I think we need to give the people who are putting this on the benefit of the doubt and let them work out the kinks. From what I can tell they've had a rough time of it because I believe this market used to be in a warehouse behind the strip and has been moved to the Springs Preserve. I think the Preserve is a great place to hold it, but if it gets any bigger (hope it does!) than they will need a bigger venue at the Preserve.\u000a\u000aThey do need better signage as well. My mother and I parked and just so happened to see people with grocery bags headed in the right direction. If you're going, park in the uncovered area of the parking lot and head around the corner to the left. There will be an open gate and a pathway to the building where the market is.\u000a\u000aOn my trip I was happy to see a lot of greens, some fruit, and some interesting odds and ends from organic growers around the valley. Farmer's markets are really great places to find new things. I happened to pick up some nice, big white grapefruits, fresh as can be spinach (my fave!), broccoli, shallots (gonna be awesome with some potatoes), and honey, AND bee pollen. Bee pollen taken regularly makes you immune to allergies! Oh and it tastes great in hot tea as well. \u000a\u000aLike I said this market is a bit on the small side, so I would say ditch the babies and kiddies at home and bring adults only. The space is too small to have children or strollers. \u000a\u000aThe prices are pricey, of course, but honestly if you're going to a farmer's market in the middle of the desert and complaining about pricing, just go to Albertson's or Wal Mart for your produce.\u000a\u000aI plan on going back for sure. The Intuitive Forager (they sell produce at the market) has an email they send out updating as to when the next market will be AND what they will be selling. Very helpful! I suggest signing up for their newsletter if you're in the market for fresh, interesting produce.

VFor being an eatery option in an airport this Baja is not bad by any means. It's definitely a better option than the hot dog place next door. So if you're going through D gates, this is a decent place to stop.\u000a\u000aFor me the service was decent, but I'm also an airport employee. Discounts, holla!\u000a\u000aI had two chicken soft "Americano" tacos. Normally I'd opt for corn tortillas, but for some reason this Baja uses flour on tacos that are "Americano". The corn tortilla tacos come with disgusting cilantro. Oh how I hate cilantro.\u000a\u000aOverall, not a bad place for a Baja Fresh in an airport.

VTotal Wine never disappoints and this location is no different than the one in Henderson I tend to visit more often. However, since I happened to be on this side of town attending a farmer's market with my hubby we stopped by Boca Park to do some shopping.\u000a\u000aThis particular Total Wine is well set-up and clean. We were not greeted by any employees though, which was kind of weird to me because at the Henderson location employees usually go out of their way to greet you and see if you need any help. But that's okay. \u000a\u000aThey have a great selection of wine, liquors, beers and even specialty sodas. This last trip I made my hubby and I purchased a Shirley Temple soda! Yep, Shirley Temple soda. It is actually really good and tastes almost like getting a Shirley Temple at a restaurant. \u000a\u000aWine lovers rejoice, Total Wine is where you need to be.

VYUM! I love this place and I'm excited it is in an area I often frequent. I will be making more and more stops here in the future.\u000a\u000aOn my first visit I was in dire need of a smoothie. After looking up places on Yelp I saw that you can get 50% off of smoothies with a check-in on Yelp! \u000a\u000aOnce I got in I realized this is primarily a vegan ice cream joint, but never the less I still wanted a smoothie. I got the Atomic Amazon smoothie, it has the following in it: Aai, Pomegranate, Grape,  Blueberry, Black Cherry, Goji, Blackberry, Apple, Dragon Fruit, Mangosteen, Banana, Strawberry, Rose Hip, Hibiscus, B-12, Chia Seeds, Agave, Cardamom, OH AND I got a C-Complex supplement added. Wow, that's a lot of ingredients, and you know what? It was great. :)\u000a\u000aI look forward to going back to have their made-right-there, organic, vegan ice cream!

VAt The Palazzo/Venetian/Sands Expo - this is the place to get coffee. Forget Coffee Bean and Starbucks, and yes, dare I say even Esspesamente Illy? Yes. Unless you wante gelato - come here!\u000a\u000aSeriously this coffee is amazingly smooth and blended perfectly. I had two regular coffees and two mochas over the course of a few days working at the Sands Expo. Wow, just wow. Not only are the coffees great, but the employees are nice and inviting as well.\u000a\u000aNot only are the drinks good though, I also had a bagel with cream cheese (they did toast it for me and even gave me TWO CREAM CHEESE packets without me having to ask) and I also had a doughnut - so yummy and rich.\u000a\u000aThe prices are still kind of high, but less than Espesamente, probably on par with Starbucks. I think the prices are cheaper than the Coffee Bean in Venetian. \u000a\u000aAmazingly good coffee. Pretty decent food. Good customer service. Check this place out if you're in the neighborhood.

VPANCAKES! Oh wait... I didn't have any pancakes. I am not a fan of pancakes.\u000a\u000aAfter a night that featured my bachelorette party my friends and I absolutely needed a place to hit up for breakfast the next day. After rolling out of our alcohol-induced comas at the Golden Nugget we headed up Fremont Street to the Golden Gate. Du-Par's is truly a little "hole in the wall" place, and it's tucked away into the casino, only a small sign points you to the place.\u000a\u000aOnce we arrived we could see it was quite busy, but we were seated directly. Service was a tad on the slow side. And I guess this may be because Du-Par's apparently laid off quite a bit of its staff. At least that is the story we got from the hostess. That is kind of unfortunate, because it definitely showed through with the service we received. Although it was decent, it definitely was not what I would say as very good.\u000a\u000aRemember when you come here everything is cooked fresh and made to order so the wait time is a tad longer than going to say, IHOP, but it's worth the wait.\u000a\u000aI decided on the Avocado, Bacon, and Jack Cheese Omelet. I chose wheat toast as a side and it also comes with a side of hash browns. The omelet was absolutely delicious. I loved every bite I took of it. It was cooked so well and the cheese was melted perfectly. The bacon was evenly dispersed and the avocado just put it right over the top for me. Definitely one of the best omelets I've eaten.\u000a\u000aMy friends had the corned beef hash, our toasts were served with a few different jellies - all made right there! Another friend opted for the blueberry pie and noted it was not overly sweet - probably thanks to the fact it was actually made in house and not full of sugar/preservatives.\u000a\u000aMy omelet cost $10.50. In my opinion, that's a little steep for an omelet. I do think the prices at bit over the top for what you're getting. However, it is very good, fresh food. I don't know if I would go out of my way to go back here, but if I happened to be on Fremont Street and felt the need for some food I would probably head here.

VTHIS is the best of the best parks in Las Vegas/Henderson/Summerlin. \u000a\u000aMy husband and I needed something to do the day after Christmas. We were still groggy from eating turkey and drinking the day before though. We really did not feel like driving all the way to Red Rock. I happened to locate this park right here on Yelp, and noted from the reviews there is a small "mountain" (hill) to hike up.\u000a\u000aWhen we arrived the park was full of children and adults alike. The children were playing on the Western themed playground equipment, and some were running around on the large expanse of green grass. The park is very well kept. It looks as though it could be plopped down into a city like Colorado Springs and not be out of place. \u000a\u000a"Shoelace Mountain" is an easy hike, not too far up, not too steep, even for beginners this would be kind of easy. I am a wussy when it comes to going DOWN anything though, so of course, I had to inch my way down after we made it up. Once you get to the top there is a look-out place with information regarding the Las Vegas Valley and surrounding areas. You can see the strip, all of the valley and look across to Red Rock as well. There are also picnic benches up at the top.\u000a\u000aOverall this park is a perfect retreat for city-dwellers who don't want to go far to "get away".

VWhat's the deal with Cafe Rio? I asked myself this question many times as I whizzed by this little Mexican joint on Maryland Parkway in the heart of the University district. I was always on my way to Einstein's or Chipotle (which are both in the same general area). I let my curiosity get the best of me one day and asked a friend to meet me there for a quick lunch get together. I wish I had picked somewhere else to go.\u000a\u000aSo, the decor has little to offer, it's dark lighting inside was actually quite off-putting to me. As I approached the menu, all I could say was "meh" Minus their "award winning" pork the menu seemed same-ol, same-ol. \u000a\u000aThe place definitely wasn't packed, so I was wondering where are all these people who say this place is SO-O great? Anyway, I ordered two tacos, one pork, one chicken. My friend opted for a salad. The tacos were soggy - I couldn't believe how quickly they just dispersed juice down my arm as I tried to eat them. As for the taste - the chicken was okay, the pork - better, but nothing I can rave over.\u000a\u000aI'm guessing this place being so close to university gets great reviews from students. I can say I did enjoy the way they heated the tortillas. However, I'd just rather have Chipotle and I doubt I'll be returning to Cafe Rio any time soon.

VExcellent customer service and clean, bright dining room makes me happy. As does crispy chicken, yummy fries, and tasty bread! Cane's has all of these things.\u000a\u000aThis particular location is situated among a bunch of other fast/sit-down dining options off of a shopping center by Centennial and the 2-15. The place is busy and Cane's was busy, even when my husband and I stepped in a little after 9 PM. This Cane's is open until 1:30 AM. Pretty good place if you have a late night fried chicken craving.\u000a\u000aWhat I like best about Cane's is their customer service. Employees are nice to customers and that makes the ordering process better than most fast-food places. Also, in case you were not aware, Cane's gives a discount to military and military dependents. You will need both your ID and your spouse's ID to get two discounts per combo meal, but it is worth it! With two discounts I saved over $2 on mine and my husband's food.\u000a\u000aThe combo meals we received were great. Nicely fried chicken strips, not greasy, fries, also not greasy. Came out with the much needed Cane's sauce (for me anyway). And of course, the mandatory chunk of bread. I'm not a huge fan of the bread, but it's all right.\u000a\u000aOverall I would return to this locaiton when I am back in this part of town.

VWow, yes, a place that delivers to my house that is NOT pizza. \u000a\u000aOrdered Chicken Curry (yellow, medium) and a Thai Salad (pretty basic), and I got the complimentary egg rolls with the delivery order.\u000a\u000aCurry was all right. Not the best I have had, but maybe they do it better in the store? I can't imagine it would be all that different though because it seems as though the moment I put in my order it magically appeared at my door. Yes, that fast I tell you! By the way, delivery charge was... FREE! Yes, I ordered off of Eat24 and this was the only place around me that was not charging a delivery fee.\u000a\u000aMy Thai Salad was good, lots of tomatoes and cucumbers. Very fresh and of course a nice compliment to the curry. I like to eat the salad and curry at the same time. It just seems to cleanse the palette so you don't have spicy, spicy coming at you the entire time.\u000a\u000aThe egg rolls were quite yummy. I like to dip them in the spicy chili sauce - I wish they'd given me more instead of bringing a cup of the sweeter sauce. \u000a\u000aOverall I loooooved my food, right in the comfort of my own living room.

VBar+Bistro I so wanted to give you a better rating, but alas I cannot.\u000a\u000aI met up with a friend here last night to watch three bands play. The last band, being from Alabama and consisting of a guitar player, washtub bass, snare drum player (yes just one drum), and a girl who switched up playing a washboard and a saw (yes, a saw), made my experience here be bumped up to two stars, otherwise I would have given the place a 1-star rating for last night.\u000a\u000aBar+Bistro is on its way to being a cool, hip place to eat and hang out. Unfortunately, it has its hiccups. So let me start off by saying, I did enjoy my food, it was good and I can tell someone is putting care into making it. Moving on...\u000a\u000aI ordered the Mahi Mahi Tacos, my friend ordered the fries. The fries came out first and then quickly after, my tacos. The fries were good, my tacos were good. But it ends there. The tacos came as a "make it yourself" platter, which is a fun thing to do. However, I just kept thinking, "I could go down the street to Tacos El Gordo and have FIVE awesome tacos for less money than I'm spending now AND I wouldn't have to make them myself". That's just where my mind wanders I guess.\u000a\u000aMy biggest complaint of the night: the bartenders. I've stated before that chick bartenders piss me off and tonight the case was in full swing. There were two bartenders working that night, both ladies, both with dark hair. I walked up to a bar that was half full, pulled out my money and ID (because I always get ID'd) and stood there, obviously looking like I wanted to order. I proceeded to make eye contact with both of the bartenders many times. Finally, one came by and said she'd be "right with me". "Thanks" I replied back. She then proceeded to walk around the bar again. \u000a\u000aAt this point two older gentleman walked up to the bar yelling pleasantries at the bartender. She walks up to them, chats, and then serves them........... BEFORE ME. \u000a\u000aI was so irritated by this point I just pointed to the beer in the hand of one of the guys beside me and she walked off and got me my beer. Since I already had $3 in my hand I just gave her the money and walked off. She should not have gotten a tip from me at all.\u000a\u000aSo, I want to like Bar+Bistro, I really do. The al fresco dining is awesome, but with staff treating customers so poorly it is hard for me to want to go back.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Sometimes my bias of bartenders gets the best of me. But just so everyone knows, the bartenders at Bar+Bistro are very nice and even contacted me via Yelp about my experience. I am going back to Bar+Bistro and I am certainly hoping for a better experience. I think it will definitely be better in the next go round. :)

VI returned to Bar+Bistro this past Friday night at the request of some friends and especially because an old friend was coming in from out of town. We had a group of seven of people, although we originally thought it was going to be smaller than that. Our server was helpful enough to switch some tables around to accommodate our group.\u000a\u000aWe dined on the patio and although it was a bit hot at times it was the perfect spot for a group of friends to catch up and have a good time.\u000a\u000aWe ordered: \u000a\u000aSpanish Alchacofa Dip\u000aGarlic Pollo \u000aB+B Slider\u000aTempura Calamari\u000aDonut Churros\u000a\u000aSome of the group was just there to drink, others shared all the food. Our consensus was the Alchacofa dip, garlic pollo, and the donuts were the best. The calamari was really chewy, almost to a point I really did not want to eat it and I was not a fan of the tempura-style. My friend said the B+B slider was great. However, I think the star of everything was the donut churros with the spicy chocolate sauce.\u000a\u000aAlthough my first experience here fell flat, this go-round was much better. Our server was consistent and very nice as well. I look forward to coming here from time to time. But I will say that I still think this place needs to be around for a little more before it's going to be top-notch Vegas dining.

VAs one can see my reviews for Bar+Bistro are very inconsistent and all over the place, so it's no surprise I am once again giving a totally different review from before.\u000a\u000aAll right, Bar+Bistro has had a lot of bad press. They were on Dirty Dining and they were on one of those Mystery Diner shows as well. Both of these PR situations went very poor for them. On top of that the owner was one of he main people who struck out against food trucks in Vegas. All of this equals bad PR. Add to the fact I have had one friend who had an absolutely horrendous time here and another friend who has experienced really mediocre visits. So why did I even go back?\u000a\u000aI bought a coupon off of restaurant.com. That's why. I went for lunch on a very non-busy Tuesday afternoon (about 2 PM). I walked in to a completely empty dining room, a completely empty patio, and one waitress. I was seated in the main dining area.\u000a\u000aSupposedly they have gone through some changes, new wait staff, and new head chef. I really did not see any changes to the menu though. What I ordered:\u000a\u000aBishop's Peak Chardonnay ($9.95) recommended by the server. It was decent. It had a buttery texture, although a bit too acidic at the end for me to shell out another 10 bucks for a second glass.\u000a\u000aFrench Onion Soup ($7) - The broth did not have enough depth. The onions used were chopped a bit too small for my liking and the were clumped heavily together in the bottom of the bowl. However, it was not charred on top and the cheeses used complimented the soup very well. They made a unique flavor to the soup that I cannot deny I enjoyed.\u000a\u000aChicken Club ($11) - It comes with a choice of fries, or salad, I picked the fries and honestly these fries were superb. Not greasy. Crispy, yet not over-done. There was a hint of spiciness to them that I quite enjoyed. As for the sandwich it is quite large, so I took one half home. There was a lot of bread, too much honestly. Avocados, which I love and the veggies on it were fresh enough. The chicken could have been just a bit more moist, but I will not complain.\u000a\u000aOverall, I was pleased, that is until I handed over my restaurant.com certificate and my debit card for payment. The server returned with my bill with added gratuity, and already charged to my card. This is the second time I've been bamboozled in such a way by a restaurant after they see my gift certificate. I was not a large party, I was one person. So why was I charged an automatic gratuity? Nothing on restaurant.com's certificates say you will be charged. It simply says to tip on the amount of the REAL check, not the discount. So apparently this waitress saw fit to go ahead and just charge me her tip without me asking.\u000a\u000aI would have paid 20%, that's 2% more than what most people pay. And I always pay 20% because I used to be a server. I understand there are some cheap-o's out there, but when you assume everyone is going to stiff you, you are really opening yourself up for some criticism. Had the waitress not put her sly moves on my debit card I would have gladly given more stars as I really did enjoy my meal.

VWomp womp womp.\u000a\u000aSeriously that is what I think when I open the wrapper of a Checker's burger. This place is super close to my house and they sent some coupons out to us in the mail so I decided to make it my lunch today.\u000a\u000aTheir burgers are SMALL. Maybe it's my hungry Mmmerican appetite and being spoiled with huge plates of food, but the burgers are puny! Definitely nothing amazing going on with them either. Your typical fast-food burger. Inn-N-Out, Smashburger, 5 Guys - all better than Checker's. \u000a\u000aAlso, they sent me a coupon for a $1.99 CHEESEBURGER combo. I went through the drive-thru and explained that I had the coupon, but I wasn't sure which combo it was. The lady on the other end seemed to know what was up and said what I needed to order was the #13. Sure whatevs! So I pull around and pay for my cheap combo: $2.80 - something like that?\u000a\u000aFor some reason I had the suspicion she gave me a hamburger combo and I was right! She did give me a hamburger combo! BOO! Come on Checker's if you're going to send out a coupon please give me the right combo meal! I was pining for a cheeseburger all because of your coupon!\u000a\u000aI would say go to another place to get your fast-food burger on.

VAttention hole in the wall seekers, if you're looking a for a new "hole the wall" place to get really, really good, honest burgers then look no more! \u000a\u000aI've had Badger Cafe on my radar for awhile. For one, it's on the East side where I happen to live and I pass by the place almost everyday on my commute to work at the airport. Secondly, once I saw it and Yelped and saw the reviews regarding two of my favorite things - burgers and wings I was instantly wooed into wanting to go. Last night, I finally convinced my husband to get out of our rut of going to the same place and we decided on Badger Cafe.\u000a\u000aIt's a small place, not much seating, and is pretty much an extra room off of the Rumrunner Bar next door. It's seat yourself, so don't stand a around like dum dums (my husband and I did). \u000a\u000aService - A little sketch, but I wasn't surprised. A gentleman who appeared to be a prep cook of some kind came over and took our drink orders. He returned with them and I sipped my Coke. It was little off - like their syrup wasn't working correctly. Not a big deal. Moving on, our waitress, a woman who seemed to be a bit frantic came over and took our order. I noted she had her name tag on upside down as she hurried away from us with our order.\u000a\u000aFood - We both went for the burgers - 1/2 pounders of Angus beef. The way you pick your burger is with a scorecard system. You check off boxes of what you want on it and that's the way they prepare it. Some items are free and others cost a little extra, but with the actual burger itself starting at ONLY $3.99 it's a good deal. I had mine with double cheese, pickles, lettuce, grilled onions, and Oretega chilis. My husband got his with lettuce, double cheese, and coleslaw. We also got an order of cheese curds. The cheese curds were pretty good, but for $4.99 a pop I was expecting MORE. I felt as though they skimped on the portion for the price.\u000a\u000aBurgers - amazing. I thought mine was cooked perfectly (medium well), it had a char on it that reminded me of my Dad's burgers out on the grill. I mean, what's better than the taste of home? Nothing. The bun was toasted and a bit crunchy, yet soft in the middle. The cheese was perfectly melted and the grilled onions & chilis were the perfect combo (for me anyway). My husband per usual said his was good. He wasn't as thrilled as I was.\u000a\u000aOverall - The place is a dive for sure, but if you hanker for a good burger, check this place out! I plan to return to try out their wings very soon.\u000a\u000a** UPDATE **\u000a\u000aI didn't want to do a completely new review because I don't have much to say. But what I can say is this - stick to the burger and wings. I branched out and got the Philly Supreme on my most recent visit and I was severely disappointed. The service was still good, the cheese curds were still good, but ugh that sandwich was a downer, big time. \u000a\u000aPS - Sat on the bar side this time as well (Rum Runner) and you can order the food from Badger Cafe and eat it in the bar - so you can watch the football game!

VStill holding strong at 4 Stars, Badger Cafe has a safe place nestled in my heart. When I know I want grease and burgers and to walk away smelling like a fry cook I come here.\u000a\u000aLast time my husband and I went the place was packed, although we were able to find a seat, we did wait for quite awhile to not only place our drink orders, but also our food orders.\u000a\u000aHowever, the waitress wasn't just standing around doing nothing. Yes, THE waitress, the only one in a restaurant with packed tables, also serving food to the bar next door, and bar-side seating in front of the kitchen. She was hustlin'. Plus she is super nice and in-yo-face. Which, some people will like, others will not. She will sit down next to you and take your order. Seriously, expect it. \u000a\u000aAnyway, this place is for a special kind of people. But the food is amaze. Burgers are the best. Always done right and to your specifications. Plus, it's cheap.

VWhat can I say? Just not impressed. For all the hype I've heard about this place and numerous good reviews I was just disappointed. \u000a\u000aLet me start with the good. I went here for a friend's birthday dinner. My friend and I showed up early before the rest of our group. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks. Here's the good: our bartender was incredibly attentive and funny. My friend doesn't drink much so he gave her a hard time (but it was all in good fun). He was very inquisitive about our tastes in alcohol, and eventually he made me a very tasty cocktail which I enjoyed. He also made some shots for myself and my friend (didn't charge us, very nice of him!). I also asked him to make a drink that was "purple". Based on the fact that my friend who was having the birthday's favorite color is indeed, purple. He obliged. So basically the two stars in this review is all for that particular bartender. Wish I remembered his name.\u000a\u000aLet's get on to the BAD. This place is supposed to be Americanized Tapas I guess. When we were sat for our party the waiter took awhile to come around. He took drink orders, but then took FOREVER to come back to take our food order. Also, there was a hub-bub about the all you can eat special. Some people at our table wanted to do the all you can eat, and some did not. The waiter refused to let us do that. RIDICULOUS. Just because my friend wants to do all-you-can-eat and I do not does not mean you should refuse someone. They acted like we were going to take off the plates of the other people who were having all-you-can-eat. We even explained that we were locals, and we felt it was kinda unfair treatment. We all ended up just ordering without the all you can eat.\u000a\u000aI had the fish tacos which were bland and boring. They came with shredded lettuce and a small bit of pico de gallo. Nothing else, not even a hot sauce or sour cream. I also had the PB&J which I felt was okay, but nothing to rave over. I think the best thing there was the bread they offered before we got our meals.\u000a\u000aIf you want tapas in Las Vegas go to Firefly. At lest you'll get REAL tapas with decent portions, and you won't be made to follow their silly rules, which I think are probably made up there because they know tourists will abide and probably just decide that everyone will do the AYCE, even if someone in the party doesn't want to.\u000a\u000aIf you're looking for good cocktails and you'd like to see a bit of a show (they do flare) than JS may be good, but go somewhere else for tapas!! You will be happy you did.

VI went to Miraculous Massage based on a deal I found on LivingSocial. I have zero massage experiences to compare it to, but I got a massage and a facial right after. I have had a few different facials, pumpkin peels, etc. \u000a\u000aI'm not giving 5 stars because it did take me a couple tries to actually get the appointment made. A few calls, no one answered. Left a message, finally someone called me back. They DO have an online system to set an appointment, but I wanted to make sure they knew I had the LivingSocial deal.\u000a\u000aSome pros include the fact they are a clean establishment, although small. They did offer me water while I waited. Nice music plays throughout the establishment and everything is quiet and tranquil.\u000a\u000aAs for my massage: I had the therapeutic massage, and I let the lady performing it know I had never had one before. She kindly let me know how it would go and I was very glad to have her explain the process to me. We go on nicely during the massage, she asked only a few times how the pressure was. She may have been a bit too talkative in my opinion. I don't mind a bit of small talk, but this was a bit much in my opinion. Of course I've never had any other massage to compare this to. \u000a\u000aAfter my massage she also showed me some easy stretches to perform based on what I had told her about my left shoulder hurting and how much sitting I do behind my desk every day.\u000a\u000aNext I went to my facial, and it was great! I just loved it. The woman performing it was quiet and did not speak much except to tell me she was going to extract some blackheads - ugh. That hurt and she just kept going at it. At least I knew she was doing a good job. She even massaged my arms, head, face, and shoulders.\u000a\u000aI left feeling great. The next day I definitely felt a bit sore, but it has been a month since my massage and I still feel A LOT better than I had before my massage.\u000a\u000aI would go back here, but it is quite far from where I live. However, based on this good experience I may have to suck it up and take the drive.

VRubio's, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways...\u000a\u000a1. I have never been to a Rubio's that did not serve me delicious, hot, fresh food.\u000a\u000a2. The Famous Fish Tacos are absolutely amazing. I have had them all kinds of ways, grilled, blackened, different types of fish, even the fried ones are great.\u000a\u000a3. Prices are decent for what you're getting and since it is a step-up from typical "fast food" it is to be expected.\u000a\u000a4. Salsa bar!\u000a\u000a5. Even the rice and beans always come out hot and tasty, some places can get their side dishes all wrong, but not Rubio's!

VTalk about this Rubio's in particular...\u000a\u000aNow we all know Rubio's food is great and their fish tacos are awesome. But this location in Henderson has some of the nicest staff of any place I have ever been to. I came here today with my husband to redeem my $7 Birthday Meal Coupon. I was greeted happily and all of the staff said "Happy Birthday!" to me. \u000a\u000aThe place is always super clean. The salsa bar is always stocked. The food is always good. The staff must be loving their jobs because their happiness does not seemed forced. \u000a\u000aThis is definitely my go-to Rubio's out of all the ones in the Valley.

VYummy, cheap, a thousand times better than Panda Express or any other main-stream place (such as L&L). This is a very non-assuming joint in a big shopping center off of Craig in North Las Vegas, but if you find it, you have found a gem!\u000a\u000aI went here on a lunch date with a friend of mine and we arrived just around 11:40 AM on a Friday. There were open booths/tables and a small line. We both took our time checking out the menu and decided to get one of their daily specials, the "808" special. You get two choices of entrees (however it is limited to certain ones), and your choice of slaw, rice, or a mixed green salad. \u000a\u000aMy friend and I like to share so we thought this would be the best way for us to try a bunch of different things, so here's what we got:\u000a\u000aChicken Katsu\u000aShoyu Chicken\u000aGrilled Salmon\u000aGarlic Ahi\u000aSpam Musubi (2)\u000a\u000aMy favorites were definitely the grilled salmon and the garlic ahi. The chicken was so-so. So I would absolutely reccomened the fish dishes over anything else here. The salmon seriously had this amazing flavoring in it that made it so yummy. My friend doesn't even like salmon and she said she liked this one. The musubi was good too and it had just come out fresh when we ordered ours.\u000a\u000aI love that you can get a green salad here as a side. This one they had was great too - leafy greens, very fresh and with a nice side of dressing as well. \u000a\u000aIf you live in the NLV area you should definitely make it a habit to come here. I know I'm going to be coming back.

VWhoa buddy I found some tasty food. I spent an evening at Soyo with two friends for a small birthday celebration.\u000a\u000aFirst off this place is much more like a bar and grill type atmosphere. When you walk in the lighting is dark and there are tables and long booths alongside one wall. You can tell they take a lot of pride in their alcohol selection. The complimentary barley tea was a great way to start the night. We ordered a round of the lychee soju to share as well. I typically don't like lychee, but it was good in this form. It was a bit too sweet for me though.\u000a\u000aWe ended up ordering quite a few dishes. I must say the garlic chicken wings stuck out to me as my favorite dish. They were flavorful and big, although a bit sticky, but still tasty. I even brought some home to my boyfriend and he liked them! He usually steers clear of anything that is not meat and potatoes or pizza. \u000a\u000aI also like the fried dumplings, but they were a bit greasy. For my main dish I got the Dol sot bi bim bap and it was delicious! I didn't think I'd make a dent in it, but I ate almost the entire thing. I really liked how it came out sizzling and snapping.\u000a\u000aOverall this was a great experience, much better than I've had at other Korean places. I would definitely go back here to try some more of their dishes.

VI had to update my review based on my last experience at Soyo. Soyo is a nice spot for food and nightlife. It really is, to me, a different type of "going out" in Las Vegas because you can come here, drink, eat, and listen to Asian pop music. Plus the atmosphere is lively and loud. Food is pretty good, although on my last visit I wasn't terribly impressed with what I ordered. Unfortunately for me when I go to places like this my food is either hit or miss. This time, it was a miss.\u000a\u000aFor the food - we shared an order of friend dumplings, and of course, the array of appetizers. For me, the fried dumplings were the best thing I ate that night. My main meal was the short ribs in the soup with noodles and what I can only guess some sort of radish. My friends concurred to it being a radish-like vegetable. I was disappointed in the dish. It lacked depth and flavor. It was also quite boring looking. The meat was SO very sinewy I could barely eat it - but I was starving, so I did. The only GOOD meat was to be found on the bones, which I attacked and ate after I had slurped up all the noodles. I was wanting my friend's Dol sot bi bim bap.\u000a\u000aIn the future, if I return, which is questionable I think I'll stick to the bim bap and chicken wings (which we also didn't get and I wish we had!). \u000a\u000aAs for the biggest offense during the night - our terribly poor service. I can expect slow service, but this was like a glacier moving through the Arctic slow. It didn't take long for our food to come out, but after we were done eating (and our plates had not been cleared by the way) we waited, and waited, and waited. It was pretty obvious we were done. Eventually one of my friends flagged down a server. THEN she had to flag down ANOTHER server. Two servers to get our bill. \u000a\u000aWith all being said and done, my rating must be down-graded. Perhaps they can recover some stars in the future. It is not a bad place, just this experience left me desiring better service and better food.

VI really like this spot downtown for numerous reasons. I really appreciate the fact that they go 21+ after a certain time at night, because honestly I do not want to be downtown and run into teenage mouth-breathers when they shouldn't be down there in the first place. Coffee, wine, beer, music, and friendly service. \u000a\u000aI first went to The Beat during Neon Reverb to listen to a few bands. Although I wasn't a fan of the bands, I was a fan of the wine selection they had. Strangely when the band finished playing the entire place went completely silent. It was really odd, so much so my boyfriend and I kind of burst out laughing just to break the silence.\u000a\u000aFew weeks ago I hit up The Beat again and had food. I ordered the Roast Chicken Sandwich ($6.99), which I think is a *bit* overpriced. I mean, that's all I got - just the sandwich. I mean, it was good, I will admit it was perfectly made and the taste was to my liking. My friend got the ever-popular "Slap & Tickle" (PB&J plus BACON), $5.99. \u000a\u000aBest part of all: the large window looking outside to Fremont Street. Park yourself in front of this window during a night and watch the fun parade of crack-heads, tourists, and hipsters downtown. I'd go back down here just to get coffee and spend a few hours people watching.

VAre you serious? This place is terrible. Out of all the places you can go see a movie in Vegas - don't come here! This theater is terrible. The only reason I am giving one star is because I have to, and I guess because my boyfriend and I were 2 of 6 people in the movie we went to here.\u000a\u000aNo stadium seating. It's 2012. Get stadium seating.\u000a\u000aTiny movie screen, bright annoying overhead lights, seats that are terribly uncomfy, and a sad little snack bar. \u000a\u000aI got a Groupon for buy one get one tickets here. I received the tickets in the mail and decided to see Act of Valor. When I arrived at the theater I was greeted with the fact that I had to shell out $1.50 extra per ticket because I was seeing a movie that was less than 2 weeks old. Gee, thanks AMC and GROUPON. See if I ever use your services again.

VDelicious Black & White Mocha. Quick, caffeine kick-start. It's a drive-thru by the way (in case you didn't read that in the other Yelp reviews). I needed to grab a little something while on a lunch break from my CPR class at the Nevada Health Center. This place was perfect! \u000a\u000aThe staff are very nice and the beverage was top-notch! I also got a banana-nut muffin (it was pre-packaged! sadness.). But it was BIG and it still had good flavor, so I can't knock stars off for that. \u000a\u000aAll in all, I like!

VI'd like to wait to write a review until I've been to Sambalatte again, but because it is so far from where I live it will be awhile before I make it out there again. So for this case I want to admit I adore this place and wish with all my heart I lived closer or it were closer to me. \u000a\u000aI love coffee joints and ones that do food, coffee, and tea with love and care. This is Sambalatte. The atmosphere, is yes, hipster, but the coffees are the draw for me, not so much the ambiance and type of people who frequent this place.\u000a\u000aIt absolutely reminded me of the few coffee joints that populate the Reno River Walk area. It's an area which I miss terribly living in Las Vegas, because Las Vegas has no river walk to speak of. However, I can at least teleport myself back to those places with Sambalatte.\u000a\u000aI will be back, and the next time I will be hungry, because their macaroons, sandwiches, and other items looked amazing.

VWhenever I am on the West side of town for whatever reason I love to be able to stop by Samabalatte. It has become a tradition of mine to make a reason to get near the vicinity just to say I must go.\u000a\u000aMy rating of 5 Stars stands proudly after quite awhile. My most recent trip was for post-dinner lattes with a friend. I ordered the Nutella Cappuccino which is beyond excellent. I have not and doubt I will find a drink here I dislike. I believe prices to be right on for what you are getting, and much less than Starbucks.\u000a\u000aI enjoy the seating, the ambiance, and the friendly patrons. I also am impressed by their shining customers service. On my last trip here there was also a band playing out front. So, this coffee shop offers everything it should and it is doing it right. Good job.

VI'm late on the bandwagon for KoMex and it looks as though I will skip the bandwagon all together. My experience here was sub-par to say the least, and I won't be saying the least because I am going to point out their offenses in my review.\u000a\u000aAmbiance - When we walked in the restaurant was not smaller than I'd imagined, but definitely dingier. It actually quite compliments the rundown structure/business park it is sitting in. The area is atrocious and parking spaces are few. The table my friend I were seated at was clean, but when I sat down on the pillow covered benches the pillows moved all over the place. I had to grab onto it to make sure it didn't go sliding to the floor.\u000a\u000aService - The person who greeted us had just sat a table of 6 men in a corner table area. When I noted we would be a 2-person table she simply pointed at a table and walked away. Very nice! Not even a word, just a point. Then came our server, who was nice and gave us some advice as to not order a whole order of nachos, but our service was slow and fairly bland. \u000a\u000aFood - So I have heard people rave, rave, rave about how good the food is. Okay, the prices are pretty cheap for how much food you're getting. But here's my problem. I ordered the bulgogi enchilada platter. Normally when I pay $6.99 for an enchilada platter at a Mexican place I get rice, beans, wonderfully smothered enchiladas. But here - I got a shit-ton of rice I really didn't want anyway, and 3 smallish enchiladas with congealed red sauce and WAY too much cheese. My entire freaking plate was pretty much cheese. The bulgogi had a very good BBQ'd flavor, so I can't complain there, but the plate in general wasn't pleasing to me. On the plus side - their tortilla chips are absolutely amazing. Perfectly crisp and delicious. The bulgogi nacho platter my friend and I shared was great! It had the perfect amount of toppings and meat. Plus the half order is HUGE - definitely more than enough for two people.\u000a\u000aTiming - You know how you want to get your food at the same time as the person you're eating with? Well, KoMex fails big time in that area. My friend and I ordered the nacho plate, obviously as an appetizer. It never arrived. Then all of the sudden our server brought out my enchiladas. Then she brings out my friends tacos, and THEN we finally get our platter of nachos. I mean come on - it's pretty obvious when people order a nacho platter to share they want it before their main entrees. Plus I get the feeling our nachos had been sitting waiting to be taken out to us for some time, because they were a little bit warmer than room temp.\u000a\u000aLastly - oy vey, I hate to say it. At the end of our meal I noticed a little something something on our table. I also noticed it was moving. Believing it to be a gnat that may have come in from the open door I waved at it, but it still kept moving. Then as I pointed it out to my friend it was a bug crawling around on the table. Now I am not sure what kind of bug, I mean I could take some guesses, but it looked like a baby to me. Therefore there must be a nest somewhere one can only deduce. At that moment I covered my plate with my fork and refused to eat anymore.\u000a\u000aI will not be back. It's kind of sad because the food was okay and I would have liked to of given KoMex another shot.

VMy fiance bought a mountain bike from Mcghie's and has since brought it back here for regular tune-ups. I went with him on his last trip before he ended up selling the bike to a friend. We thought we were moving to Alaska, so we were parting with some possessions that weren't going to make the trip. Um, now we aren't going, but that's another story...\u000a\u000aAnyway, on the trips here I noted the store is very well set up and clean. As you enter you are more than often greeted by the sales staff. The bike maintenance area is in the back and you just have to wheel your bike back there to have it looked at/worked on.\u000a\u000aThey were quick to bring up fiance's account and just as quickly took his bike back into their maintenance area and we were off and out the door. When we came back to pick it up, it was right there at the front, my fiance thanked them and we were again, out the door quickly and efficiently. \u000a\u000aI don't know much about mountain bikes, skis, etc. But from what I have seen/heard the service here is pretty top notch. My fiance says he would definitely recommended the place as well.

VI went to Lee's with much trepedation after reading countless bad reviews, but I just had to try this spot on my lunch break because it was convienent.\u000a\u000aFirst off, I took heed from other Yelpers and stayed away from the baguettes and instead got a croissant roast beef and cheese with all the trimmings. It was a decent sandwich, nothing to rave about, but everything tasted good.\u000a\u000aSecondly I was weary of ordering a drink due to the excessive ice comments. I just opted for a soda in case I got the same treatment of ice with an expensive coffee beverage. Well... there was a lot of ice, but at least I didn't pay an arm and a leg for it.\u000a\u000aThat was it. Short and sweet. Oh I did happen to only have my card and my total came to $8.97. The cashier informed me I wouldn't be able to use the card unless I bought $15 or more the NEXT TIME I came in. ha! Not sure why I got away with that, but hey, I did!\u000a\u000aOh they have fro-yo here too. I did not try, it but it looked good!

VSo close to home and much better than any Thai food I've had on the East side. Gotta go with 4 stars for Stick E Rice.\u000a\u000aThey are located in a shopping mall off of Desert Inn. You'll see them next to a Mexican grocery store and a UPS shipping store. I've driven past them countless times, but never really gave much of a thought to going until yesterday when I was dropping off stuff to ship at the UPS. The lunch specials caught my eye - $6.95! Now that's what I'm talking about.\u000a\u000aThe dining area is super nice looking, almost *fancy*. Believe me, you will be surprised to walk in here from the outside. There was nice music playing overhead and I was greeted quickly by the two women at the back counter. Although I was interested in their lunch specials, they did not really have what I wanted so I ordered from the normal menu instead (to go).\u000a\u000aPanang Curry with Chicken (heat level 4 out of 5) - Pretty good, but the chicken had a bit of an odd texture to me when I got it home and began eating it. The spice was right on par. I definitely got a little sniffy while eating it. I wish there had been a few more vegetables/peppers. Came with a very small container of rice (I usually get more rice at other places, even when I order to go).\u000a\u000aThai Iced Tea - Pretty much Thai iced tea. Although they very nicely put a sleeve around it with a handle so I could carry it out to my car with no problem.\u000a\u000aFinal thoughts - I'll be back when I'm in the mood for Thai and I don't want to trek across the valley. This is very close to home for me and they are definitely THE cleanest looking Thai establishment I have been in on the East Side. I would also love to dine in to enjoy the ambiance of the dining area.\u000a\u000aSo, if you're in the mood for Thai on the East Side, head to Stick E Rice.

VWow. Polished is great. I went today for a soft-gel mani, a pedicure, and I got my eyebrows waxed as well. As far as a one-stop shop for multiple beauty regimes, this is a great place to go! \u000a\u000aThe online appointment system streamlines everything for you. You can make multiple appointments at the same time. They are great here about keeping everyone on schedule. I moved from each of my appointments like clockwork. I have seen from some reviews that some people do not like this experience because it does not allow for any detours along the way. As for me, I personally like this style of doing things. If you specifically make the appointment for everything you need/want then the technician should be able to do the work in the allotted time. \u000a\u000aCiCi did my soft-gel mani and honestly this is the best mani I have had in Vegas. She was very attentive to my cuticles and took her time. And she massaged my arms/hands after the mani, which is nice because at my old nail salon they hardly spent anytime doing that at all! CiCi also helped me pick out the perfect shade of pink and glitter. All I did was tell her I was there to get my nails looking nice for my new job! She knew exactly what to do! For me, this was great because I am not super picky about my nails, I just want them to look NICE. So it was nice for the nail tech to take the wheel and just drive. Obviously CiCi knows what she is doing.\u000a\u000aMy pedi was very relaxing and I enjoyed the massage chairs here. The water temp was kept at a reasonable level. Mom did my pedi and she really did take the time to do a GOOD pedicure, nothing seemed rushed to me. \u000a\u000aAfter my pedi I was taken to get my eyebrows done. The room they have to do the waxing is almost like a closet so it's kind of weird, but oh well. That's really my only ding. Mom did my eyebrows and trimmed them too. She also noted I should get my upper-lip waxed as well, so I did that too. \u000a\u000aOverall I will absolutely return to Polished for my future nail appointments. Unlike other reviewers I did not experience any negativity from the front desk. I simply walked in, gave my name, and they told me to select my colors. Maybe I just got lucky.

VPretty much your run of the mill Regal Cinema tucked away into a Station Casino. These theaters don't differ too much from each other so really going to the one closest to you is always the best bet. I just so happened to be in the Henderson area with my friend and we caught Cowboys and Aliens here.\u000a\u000aOf course all Regal Cinemas are doing the $5 movies on Tuesdays for the Summer. I've tried to catch as many flicks as possible under that current promo. \u000a\u000aThe theater was clean, there was no problem with the movie, and the staff was decent. Typically you always get the teenagers and the older people doing the ticket taking, etc. at movie theaters anyway. \u000a\u000aI think I'd rather go to GVR theaters in the Henderson area though. This one is small and doesn't really give you that whole "Ooo we're going to the movies!" vibe.

VSo happy to find a PoS near my work. I have been driving by this place for months not realizing it was RIGHT THERE. When I get out of work at 8:30 PM there are not a lot of places to go. Usually fast food is the only option for a non-costly meal. Now I have Port of Subs! This one is located in the Lowes shopping center on Eastern in close proximity to the new terminal (T3) of McCarran International.\u000a\u000aI arrived at exactly 8:40 PM last night just praying they weren't closed. They weren't! Although they were cleaning up. I felt kind of bad, as I usually do, when entering an establishment that close to when they are closing, but I really wanted a sandwich! The two male employees inside did not seem bothered by me arriving so late. They were talkative and nice while they made my sandwich. \u000a\u000aI love all of PoS sandwiches, but I usually get the #5 (Turkey, Ham, and Cheddar Cheese). There's one thing I love about PoS over Subway - they actually have SLICED cheddar cheese! At Subway you can only get it shredded. :/\u000a\u000aMy sandwich was delicious and I got a combo (about $8). It's kind of pricey, but that's just about how much you'll pay for a combo anywhere these days. \u000a\u000aThe store was clean, the employees nice, and my food was great. A+!

VChicken strips, chicken sandwich... something chicken was what my husband and I were hankering for yesterday for lunch. Drive to St. George for Chik-Fil-A? Nah. Cane's? Hmm. Ah, so I consulted Yelp and up came Strip N Dip. I remember bookmarking this one awhile ago as BFG Chicken Strips. Apparently the restaurant has gone through some changes since then, and it had a stint where it was closed, but - it is back open and man, is it good.\u000a\u000aThe location is a little odd, tucked into a shopping center sandwiched between Albertsons and Home Depot. It is small, few tables and a bar, with a few tables for outdoor seating. But the inside is cool with vibrant posters and a digital menu reader board. \u000a\u000aMy husband and I both opted for the fried 4-strip meal with the baked mac and cheese. The mac and cheese reminded me of a little personal pizza sitting in my basket. When I dug in its ooey-gooeyness and delicious cheesiness was sublime! I think more people should put cheese over macaroni like they do. \u000a\u000aAs for the strips - absolutely perfectly done. Juicy and tender on the inside yet fried to a crispy, but not hard outside. The panko breading I really enjoyed, my husband said he would have rather had a normal batter-like outside like Cane's does. *shrugs* Dipping sauces - I went with the Strip Sauce, of course, had to try that one and it is very good and addicting. And I opted for the buffalo because I wanted a bit of heat. Both good, but next time I'm definitely going for that wasabi one. \u000a\u000aThe service was SO NICE! These guys are really trying hard to make customers feel very welcome. You could even say it is a familial vibe here.\u000a\u000aIf you like Cane's, you must try Strip N Dip. Just for an alternative because they are really doing chicken strips right.

VWow wow wow. I love this place. Where else in Vegas can you get fish this fresh and just be able to walk out the door with it and enjoy it in the comfort of your own home? I'm going to say... hardly anywhere. \u000a\u000aI came to Poke Express with the intention to pick up some poke. But as I entered I saw that it is also connected to Island Sushi. What a wonderous place this little hole in the wall is. It is bursting with amazingness! You can get Hawaiian plates, sushi, and poke and be able to sit down and eat them right there. OR you can do what I did, which is to go straight to the poke counter and order up delicious poke to go in little containers!\u000a\u000aThe poke here is priced based off of market prices, so sometimes you may come and find your poke has fluctuated in price, but considering the quality of the fish and the great way the poke is prepared, I would be more than willing to spend a few extra bucks if market prices are high. There are many varieties. On my visit I ordered the Spicy Ahi with Avocado and the Salmon Poke (with special sauce). I have since tried both and they are both so good. The salmon may even be better to me than the spicy ahi AND it was a cheaper price. \u000a\u000aI can't even imagine eating fish any other way now. I don't want baked cod, I don't want smoked salmon, I don't want sushi covered in rice, I just want POKE!

VThis will be my review of my Restaurant Week 2011 experience with Max Brenner.\u000a\u000aI made my reservation for a lunch at MB with my mother. I truly wanted to take her out for Restaurant Week and seeing that MB had a yummy sounding cheeseburger I knew it would be right up my mother's alley. \u000a\u000aWe arrived about 10 minutes before our reservation and we were seated promptly at a very, very small table for two. The table was just... small. I don't know what to make of it. That's the main reason I'm not giving a 5-star rating. Especially considering the large plating options they use here I just wonder who thought such a small table was appropriate for dining? Drinking lattes, sure, but for full-blown meals? No way!\u000a\u000aOur server seemed delighted that we would be taking part in their RW menu, she asked if we wanted wine, but my mother and I both declined and got Ice Teas instead. Once we took a look at the menu, it was obvious we would each order something different and share. So, with that being said, the following is what my mother and I ate:\u000a\u000aCrispy Spice Dusted Pita Chips with Creamy Hummus\u000aChicken, Bacon & Cheddar Rolls\u000aThe Brenner Burger: Max's secret barbeque sauce, lettuce, tomato, cheddar & vidalia onion ring on top, came with waffle fries, dipping sauce, and pickles\u000aThe Unforgettable Spicy Tuna Salad Sandwich: tomato, lettuce, pickled jalapenos, crushed bbq chips brushed with cilantro & avocado mayo also came with waffle fries, dipping sauce, and pickles\u000aChocolate Chunks Pizza (1/2 serving) with hazelnuts and roasted marshmallows\u000a/Banana Tempura Fondue: warm & crispy banana bites, pure milk chocolate dip, toffee sauce \u000a\u000aThe hummus and roasted peppers that came with the pita chips were very good and the peppers were an excellent addition. The burger was delicious. I can't compliment the chefs here enough on how well they cooked the burger to my mother's specifications, medium well. The spicy tuna salad sandwich I think I could eat everyday and it has practically changed my mind about tuna sandwiches all together. If every restaurant could make tuna like that, I would eat it every time I go out.\u000a\u000aI felt as though the pizza was not as good as it is hyped up to be. The dough/bread was the downfall for me. Yes, it is clever and cute, but when it comes to taste - meh. I personally think everyone should go with the fondue! Because the banana tempura was out of this world! \u000a\u000aI will definitely be going back to Max Brenner to eat off their regular menu now. Plus I want to have a milkshake and other desserts! Overall this was a great experience.

VSometimes you find gems in the weirdest of places. During the PBR my sister and brother-in-law were in town and they were keeping their bulls at Southpoint Casino, so inevitably I ended up here with them one night. As my sister and I were walking around aimlessly we saw this ice cream parlor and decided we would share a scoop.\u000a\u000aThe place is very unassuming, tucked in away from the slots next to a Seattle's Best Coffee. It's really just a simple ice cream shop offering up Dreyer's Ice Cream while also doing the usual - banana splits, sundaes, and shakes. \u000a\u000aMy sister and I opted for a scoop of Mocha with Almonds. We almost considered getting two scoops, but then were glad we did not. They are quite generous. \u000a\u000aThere are tables to sit at and eat your ice cream, which we did. However, a lot of the tables had not been cleaned off so I'm not sure who's responsibility that is... the ice cream parlor, Seattle's Best, the customer? Besides that small issue we enjoyed the ice cream.

VOh oh El Pollo Loco! For the longest time I have ignored El Pollo and I am sad that I have. This El Pollo is not in the best part of town and I am sure this review food-wise can go for all El Pollo Locos in general.\u000a\u000aI did the drive-thru here and there was a bit of a wait, even though I seemed to be the only car there. It was probably about 10:30 PM on a Thursday night. However, the lady working the drive-thru was nice. \u000a\u000aHere's what I ordered and the main reason I'm writing this review. Chicken tacos and tamales! They were delicious. What I loved was the simple, yet flavorful taste of the meats and the tortillas. The tamale seriously was amazing. I almost thought I was eating a tamale not from a fast food establishment. As a side note, I believe they only do the tamales around Christmas time.\u000a\u000aI have had their chicken on occasion as well and I declare it to be much better than KFC. If I'm going to get a "fast food" chicken I will definitely pick El Pollo Loco over the Colonel.

VI have experienced the Magical Forest a total of three times. All three times have been with different groups of people. This year I went with my boyfriend. I wavered between giving the Magical Forest 3 or 4 stars, but I am indeed a fan of charities and even if my opinions of Opportunity Village may be less than most people, I don't mind giving out some money for a holiday treat to a local place, rather than some random conglomerate holiday activity. \u000a\u000aI was disappointed because I didn't see a Charlie Brown Christmas display this year, but there was a Coca Cola Bear display which I very much enjoyed. However, it was hard to really enjoy the forest because there were SO MANY PEOPLE. It was just very crowded. I was getting run over by strollers constantly. I realize it's a family environment, but a lot of parents just don't control their children very well.\u000a\u000aOverall it's something different to do. It will make you have holiday cheer. So if that's what you're looking for than the Magical Forest is a good place for you.

VIn case you were wondering whatever happened to Mervyns... \u000a\u000aWell Kohls has been around for many a year now and there happens to be one in my living vicinity. It's one of the few clothing store in my area in a shopping center with a Target. Kohls sends me mail all. the. time. How they got my information is beyond me, but I've been on the tail end of a "I don't have any money left in my bank account" kind of month. BTW - if you've ever wondered how much it sucks to pay for grad school out-of-pocket, well, it sucks a lot.\u000a\u000aI have a banquet I am going to in honor of one of my professors from college and I really wanted to get a new dress and jewelry. Unfortunately I have very little money right now. I decided, what the hell, I will check out Kohls and just see if they have something I can afford. \u000a\u000aTo begin with the store itself is fine. There's really nothing wrong with it save for some things being a tad messy. To me it looks as though they are understaffed, hence the reason for the messiness. They had a sparse amount of employees working when I was there. No one at the registers. No one in the jewelry department. No one really milling about in the misses clothing either. I was not asked if I needed any help. I browsed and found a dress and went into the fitting rooms. The one I went in still had clothing hanging up in it.\u000a\u000aI browsed the jewelry section and found a necklace. Seems as though everything here is either 40% or 50% off or some kind of sale. \u000a\u000aLastly when I went up to pay there were two girls and between the two of them it took a few minutes to figure out who was going to ring me up. I ended up being escorted back to the jewelry counter to be rung up for my purchases. The girls were nice enough, just a little disorganized.\u000a\u000aOverall I would never shop here on the regular. This was certainly one of those desperate times call for desperate measures types of things.

VTacos El Gordo changed my life.\u000a\u000aAh, I'm just kidding (kind of). But I went here late on a Sunday night because I had taken my good friend from out of town to Double Down Saloon and afterward we were both having those late night, been out too long drinking pains. He said directly to me: "Take me somewhere that has crazy good, original Mexican food."\u000a\u000aI immediately thought of Tacos El Gordo and it's perfect because it is about a 5 minute drive from my house. When we got there it wasn't too busy so  we were able to go straight up and order. Note that when you order you go to different people because they are all slicing different kinds of meat.\u000a\u000aI went for the adobada, of course because I've seen all the great reviews of it. It was so good I ordered two, but then I went back and got another. The sauce on it has such a great taste and yes, you can get pineapples on it, but I do not like pineapples - so none for me!\u000a\u000aMy friend branched out, got an adobada taco, carne asada taco, and an adobada quesadilla. He gave me a taste of the quesadilla and it was just as good as the tacos.\u000a\u000aI definitely will be back to try the other tacos. It's such an easy concept and for some reason I really like places that specialize in just a few things these days. It means they can really hone in on making something really delicious, rather than doing a bunch of mediocre stuff. It's just tacos here (and a few other things), but the TACOS are what you go for. I'm talking just real good tacos.

V*** 200th Review!!! ***\u000a\u000aAs my mother and I were leaving Total Wine and more I couldn't help but saying, "This place is awesome!" Probably more than once. \u000a\u000aFirst off, an amazing selection of wines, beers, and hard liquors all clearly displayed. Employees are incredibly knowledgeable. I was thrilled when I asked for a Riesling and the employee replied, "Domestic or German?" Well, I went with German, of course. She also introduced my mother and I to a fantastic already-boozed egg nog! Wow, so great, my Mom bought a big bottle for Christmas!\u000a\u000aBonus - they were also doing wine tastings. I sampled reds and whites. My mother particularly enjoyed a Moscato, which she ended up purchasing for Christmas dinner. They were also sampling a beer from Montana and a Vodka. I partook of the beer, but ended up getting a 6-pack of Newcastle Winter Ale.\u000a\u000aI can't believe I took so long to check this place out. I know where I'll be going for wine purchases from now on!

VArgh. Groan. Kind of a waste of money. My feelings about the ice bare are all over the place honestly. I'm going to with 2 stars, because even though I thought it was "okay" it still isn't that entertaining.\u000a\u000aBut... It's an experience I can tick off my list at least! I went with a group of four and we all purchased the $15 general admission - jacket and gloves. When we got in it was empty! There were only a few people in there. Mind you, this was a Friday night on Halloween weekend! So we got free shots (poor, watered down) and took some pictures. \u000a\u000aYou have to deposit your cameras and cell phones into a locker outside before you go in. That's so they can rape you with the prices of purchasing the pictures THEY take of you. As if it isn't already overpriced to be paying $15 to go freeze and look at ice.\u000a\u000aI mean, it's a cool thing to do if you have the money to throw around, but if you just want to get drunk and party - go elsewhere! Also, make sure you go with a big group, you'll have a better time.

VCame here looking for crafty DIY stuff to make decorations for my wedding. I really like Hobby Lobby because they offer a wide variety of things. There are cute already made stuff for those who don't really want to DIY, but then they offer plain old craft stuff too, for those that want to make their own stuff.\u000a\u000aI scored an amazing black, rustic, metal easel for putting my large chalkboard on for my wedding. Only 20 bucks on sale! They have some rather cute furniture, typically on sale all the time.\u000a\u000aThe only thing I would say not to come here for is fabrics. They have a very meager section of fabrics and ribbons. Go to Joanns, much better selection!

VOh boy what is there I can't say about Hobby Lobby? I've been to the store in the last 6 months many, many times because I have been planning my wedding, which happened on Sept. 1st. I diy'd quite a few of my decorations, which is why so many trips to Hobby Lobby were necessary.\u000a\u000aAs far as the store goes, it's decent. I decided I would rent a wedding arch from HL. The woman in the flowers/bridal department was VERY helpful at the time I rented the arch. I paid $5 extra to have ivy put on it. I noted that my mother would pick it up on the day of the wedding.\u000a\u000aAbout a week and a half before the wedding myself, mother, and my fiance went to HL to find out if it would be okay for my fiance to pick up the arch instead. The employees insisted it would be fine as long as he had the reciept, so we left satisfied.\u000a\u000aSo comes my wedding day and my.fiance comes back with an undecorated arch. I was, well, a very pissed off bride. Apparently they told my fiance (now husband) since he was putting the arch in the back of his truck and it would have to be taken in pieces, the ivy couldn't be on it. Well, they never told me that, especially when I specifically said we would be picking it up with his truck. On top of that, they didn't bother giving my fiance a refund for it not being decorated, but just gave him the ivy so WE could decorate it ourselves!\u000a\u000aNext - they weren't even going to let my fiance take the arch! The manager that day originally told him, "No. You can't take it because you're not Judy Benoit (my mother)" Even though we had gone out of out way earlier in the week to ensure it would be okay for him to pick it up. Obviously there is a lack of communicatoon between store managers and employees. And I get the fact they have rules for a reason, but get everyone on the same damn boat about it please.\u000a\u000aWithout the arch fiasco my rating would be higher. But come on, to screw up like that? 2 star rating deserved.

VI feel very wrong writing this review, but having been in the Student Union a handful of times now I felt I should go ahead and write one up. The reason I feel so very, very wrong writing this is because I am an alumni of the University of Nevada, Reno. I KNOW. I am treading in very bad territory here.\u000a\u000aThe student union at UNLV sits nicely center and to the front of campus. It is close to the bookstore and is situated near a large outside area which is often used for events of all kinds. My last time being here I was attending a Walk for Autism which was using the square outside area to set up booths, play music, and be the starting point for the walk.\u000a\u000aInside the student union has multiple places for students to come together to meet, study, hang out, etc. The interior is newer in design and houses a Starbucks, Metro Pizza, a Panda Express, and other eateries. I have never gotten any of the food here though.\u000a\u000aFrom an outsider's prospective (and not a student) the Union is a decent place. Of course I cannot comment on services for students, or what it is like when classes are in full swing. However, from my position as a post-grad and just a normal old adult of the world I think it is a pretty good place.

VI was almost tempted to give only 2 stars to this event this year, and this is mostly because I feel as though they have had much better years. For instance, a couple years ago when this event was still being hosted at Sam Boyd Stadium they had a display that showcased dogs that could jump really far for a ball into a pool. It was really cool to watch, but this year they did not have nearly anything as cool as that. When I come to this type of event I understand it is for families, but it is called PETapalooza, not KIDapalooza. I felt as though they were catering more towards children (IE: Bouncy platform, rock wall to climb - meh!). How can I enjoy these things when my husband and I show up with two dogs?\u000a\u000aThen there's the overwhelming amount of food stands. I think as the years progress with this event the food stands keep getting more plentiful and the stands having anything to do with dogs gets smaller. I get it, people like to eat when they go to these things and its a fun thing to do, but come on. \u000a\u000aAs for the stands dealing with dogs - it's basically businesses trying to hawk you their services, save for the stands that are dedicated to animal rescue. For me and my husband this was a bummer and we only spent about 10 minutes walking and gazing into businesses tents.\u000a\u000aIn past years they have had obstacle courses for dogs to run, but this year - nope. There was only one in the middle of the event and it was roped off. You couldn't even use it as it was a demonstration for some company. *sigh*\u000a\u000aNext - my husband and I did sit for a bit in front of the Mix 94.1 stage and we watched Mark & Mercedes do a couple cute contests. We didn't stick around to hear any of the bands play.\u000a\u000aOverall I really want to say this wasn't too much fun. It was boring for a couple with no children. Our dogs just got to run around and sniff other dogs, but most people here pull their dogs away before the dogs even have a chance to say "Hello". We could have had a better time just going to the dog park. At least there the dogs can run free and play with each other as they want to do. Not be pulled around by their owners who are buying slushies and hot dogs.

VAt last I had a chance to visit Vanguard Lounge. My many trips downtown have always taken me to the other bars and lounges in the area. Lucky me I finally got to go here last night (which would be a Monday) and I was so very pleased! \u000a\u000aThe interior of the bar is far superior to other places on Fremont Street, in my opinion. Although I can see it may be a bit small if the place is packed. Lucky for me it was a Monday night and there was plenty of room to sit at their bar. It is classy and modern, yet it has a nice cozy feel, I think the candle light really helps the ambiance of the place. I'd like to take this time to mention the CLEANLINESS of their bathroom and the cute faucets in the sink.\u000a\u000aI sat at the bar with a few friends and the bartender was very attentive. I knew about this place's wonderful cocktails as I have read other Yelp reviews so I was pretty excited to try one. I had the Broken Neck (note it has whisky in it). And the bartender made it so, so lovely, with a lemon peel sneaking its way in a twist within the glass. AND MY GOD - the drink was delicious. It could be very, very dangerous for me. And for $10 the price, although maybe a bit pricey for downtown, was okay with me. After all, I could have been down on the strip where they charge 12 bucks for a well drink!\u000a\u000aAfter the cocktail I decided to switch to a chardonnay. The bartender offered me a tasting of the wine before he poured the entire thing in my glass. And he got me a water so I could get the pretty sweet-tasting cocktail out of my system before enjoying the wine.\u000a\u000aWow, I really love Vanguard Lounge! I don't know if I'll go back there when it is busy - it might ruin it for me! No, I'm just kidding - I'd go back there if there was a line coming out the door just so I could get that fabulous cocktail again.

VLOVE.\u000a\u000aI love Vanguard Lounge. I never leave this place unhappy. Recently went downtown for a weekend excursion per usual and hit up Vanguard for a starter. \u000a\u000aThey have bottled Blue Moon (one of my favorite beers). The bartender was nice and the place is clean and devoid of that run-downed feeling some places on Fremont have. I will say I do like that kind of charm sometimes, but other times I just want to sit in a nice lounge and Vanguard is my favorite place to do that.

VTo begin this review, I would like to point out that I definitely would like to make a return trip to Presidio. Many places in The District do not disappoint me, and Presidio can be added to that list.\u000a\u000aI went to Presidio specifically for their happy hour, which is fantastic by the way. Although I did not partake of an alcohol, my friends did and apparently the wine selection has a lot going for it (and is a reason I really want to return). Although I cannot comment on the happy hour beverages, I can comment on the food. Ah yes, and not to mention, even though we were right on the end-tale of the happy hour (in fact I think we may have been past it by the time we ordered) our waiter still gave us the happy hour menu/prices.\u000a\u000aWe had a flatbread pizza, very good! Not too greasy, and it was quite large, larger than I expected. It is more than one person can eat, so the portions are good. We also had the artichoke dip, which I thought was okay, nothing that was blowing my mind.\u000a\u000aOverall I enjoyed my first time here. I think it would be a lovely place to hang out and just have a nice, relaxing time. Only complaint of mine would be the strangeness of our waiter. He was just a bit over the top and he did some things I found out of the ordinary of typical service, such as taking my friend's wine glass and re-filling it instead of just getting a clean glass. Just somewhat strange, but not enough to keep me from returning.

VPresidio, you still just get 3-stars from me. I joined a friend here for a quick drink before heading to a movie at Green Valley Ranch.\u000a\u000aOnce again we were in the presence of the kinda weird, strangely overly personal waiter we had before. I couldn't believe it. And I'm not even sure he was supposed to be our waiter because we had to flag someone down to take our drink order.\u000a\u000aAnnoying. We were sitting in the bar area, two girls, with no drinks, no menus, and plenty of their servers still zooming around us and paying no attention. It really was not that busy and considering the many servers who walked right past us, they could have at least said "hey, I'll be right with you." But no. We had to wave someone down to get two glasses of wine.\u000a\u000aThe happy hour prices are great. The location is great. The service sucks.

VBabycakes, Babycakes, Babycakes...\u000a\u000aRed velvet pancakes, red velvet pancakes, red velvet pancakes....\u000a\u000aThese words have been dancing around in my head for months now ever since I read a bunch of reviews about this place. I finally got the chance this morning to go to Babycakes and discover if all my lingering dreams of RVP's would come true and they definitely did.\u000a\u000aMy boyfriend and I arrived today (Sunday) at about Noon and the place was packed. I knew as soon as we drove up that we would be waiting, but never the less we were going to eat here no matter what. It ended up being a 30 minute wait, actually not bad for a brunch on a Sunday in my opinion. Would I wait that long during a week day? I'm not so sure.\u000a\u000aAfter our wait we were escorted to a table in their very small dining room. Yes, this place is TINY! \u000a\u000aI ordered the Huntington Omelet and I upgraded to the red velvet pancakes ($1.50 to do so), and my boyfriend got the full-stack of RVPs. Okay, so all the hype is true - these pancakes are freaking amazing. My boyfriend said he liked his, but he didn't finish the whole plate. Probably because they're extremely rich. \u000a\u000aBut here's what I really liked, their omelet and and serving of hasbrowns were perfect sized. Not too much, not too little. It's not like going to IHOP where they bring you out an omelet the size of your head that you're never going to finish. I appreciate that. \u000a\u000aThe prices were spot-on, the service was super sweet (they kept my coffee filled, always a plus!), and the food was DELISH. \u000a\u000aBabycakes, Babycakes, Babycakes,,,,,

VI have now had Lulu's on the Move twice and I can say this food truck is really as good as it gets. The chefs here, and the people working the crowd, getting their orders, etc. are 5-Star individuals indeed.\u000a\u000aLast week I had Lulu's down on Fremont Street at the Street Food Throwdown. I was a wee bit tipsy so when I was in line and trying to read the menu I honestly couldn't get it in focus so I had my friend start reading off menu items to me. When she said "Pork Chop Tacos" I said yes please! I got an order of the tacos and of course, an order of their dirty chips. \u000a\u000aIt was a long wait for our food because there were so many people there, so we headed into The Beat to grab a glass of wine. Once we returned outside it was only a few minutes until my food had arrived! I shared my tacos with my boyfriend. I thought the tacos were great. I believe there was lima beans in them? They tasted fresh and not too filling, which is actually really exactly what I was looking for because I wanted to eat my dirty chips. Those chips are so delicious. The pork on them is perfectly seasoned and it's just such a surprise how good it is every time you eat it. \u000a\u000aIt's like comfort food on the move, from a truck, right there into your eager hands.

VFor some reason I never thought I would actually eat at HHAGG. Don't know why, just seemed like whenever I might have the chance I passed it up. Well, last night I was at The M for a Rock n Roll Wine night and definitely needed to put some food in my tummy after tasting many wines. \u000a\u000aMy friend and I arrived here and I was really surprised to see a picturesque view of the city out their large windows. The decor is nice, classy, with a touch of that "country farm" feel. Our waitress was attentive and congenial. She happily explained HHAGG's portions for me (as I had never been there before, although I did know about the portion sizes), and she quickly took our drink orders. I got a coffee and a water, my friend opted for a Mimosa (the original, but they do have variations). \u000a\u000aAfter our drinks arrived we placed our orders. I had to get the Chicken Fried Eggs Benedict, because, yes I am a fan of Man vs Food and I saw him eat this on the show. Of course, the portion was HUGE. I knew it was going to be... but ya, it's still surprising. Luckily the dish was amazingly tasty too. The chipotle sauce on top gave a nice kick. Oh and let me just say now, I fished out all the fried cheese.... because it was that freaking good. The steak was fried perfectly and the potatoes were good too. The best part of this dish is you can get a different bite every time or you can select what you want to get on your fork: little egg, bit of chicken, and a bunch of potatoes... Mmmmm. \u000a\u000aThe only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I got a tummy ache the next morning. It's probably my own fault because the food was REALLY rich and I ate too much of it. Overall I really enjoyed this HHAGG. If I go back I will definitely come to this one as I have heard pretty bad reviews on the others.

VI'm dropping my original 4-Star Review to 3-Stars. Yes, I have good reason, don't worry, I'll get to it.\u000a\u000aI still think this HHAGG at The M is the best in the valley. The ambiance is lovely and the view is great. Our waitress, although seeming a bit tired, was helpful and happy to get us our food via our coupon I bought through Travelzoo.\u000a\u000aMy Travelzoo coupon included: 2 entrees (up to $14.95), 2 drinks, alcoholic included, and a pancake appetizer. My mother and I ordered the Blueberry Pecan Pancake. It came out and well, it was bigger than my face. Yes of course, everything here is huge, but somehow it never fails to surprise me when it comes out. The pancake was very good. I loved the crunchy pecan versus blueberries cooked directly into the pancake itself.\u000a\u000aNext is our meals: I ordered the Hammered Pork Loin Benny. My Mom got the "Man vs Food" Sage Fried Chicken Benny. We both though our mashed potatoes were quite cool when we received the dishes and we picked around them to eat everything else. I personally thought my pork loin was quite bland, and yes I realize it is "hammered", but it was like a flat sheet. I found it hard to cut and I was not a fan of what they used to bread it with.\u000a\u000aLastly, my mother needed to get change for a $20 so we could leave a tip. When she went up front to see if she could exchange the $20 for smaller bills, the flippant bus boy directed her to the casino change machine. Well I can understand if you don't give out change, but to rudely direct a customer to the casino floor without any general niceties it just rude.\u000a\u000aSo my rating falls for HHAGG. Will I try again? Perhaps. But my favorable view of them is slipping.

VThis place is so sweet. I love it. \u000a\u000aI am hardly ever on this side of town, but I was getting some spa services done at Allure Medi Spa, which is in the same shopping center. I noted there was a bakery and made note to go inside after my treatments to see if they had macaroons.\u000a\u000aOh yes, they have delightful macaroons! So many different flavors, and executed perfectly. They also have other desserts and fresh baked breads. Two ladies ahead of me ordered a bagette and they said it was fantastic. \u000a\u000aI was not in the mood to eat, but I am sure the place has some good food based off the quality of the macaroons. Next time I go for my treatments at the spa I am going to make a mental note not to eat and instead eat here! \u000a\u000aAlso, the ladies in front of me were taking a long time to decide what they wanted (I didn't mind because I was just having fun looking at the goodies!), but the gentleman who got my macaroons offered to give me a couple on the house because of the wait. Now that is the sign of a great establishment!

VMy niece is in town and myself and my parents are showing her the fun things to do in Vegas (for minors). We decided why not head down to Fremont Street and do the zipline? \u000a\u000aThe line is definitely long, but the line to actually get papers and pay goes quick. You do have to sign a bunch of waivers that basically say, "You can't sue us if you die". \u000a\u000aThe only downside is the wait when you get up to the top to actually do the zipline. I get it, you just have to wait. But we made reservations - which the girl touted would definitely get us onto the zipline quicker, and it did not. Our reservations were technically for 10:45 PM. But when you get the ticket it says 10:45 PM - 11 PM. Well, my niece and I did not get into actual harnesses until 11:10 PM. So really? There's no point in the stupid reservations.\u000a\u000aOther than that, it really was fun. I'm glad they've extended it because I would not pay $20 had it been as small as it was last year. \u000a\u000aYou gotta do it at night. Just pay the few extra bucks, you won't regret it!

VOne of the very few Michaels left in the valley. I believe there are only 3 Michaels craft stores in Las Vegas, which blows my mind. I have no idea why there aren't more. None of the locations are very convenient for me as they are all a pretty far drive from where I live. This one is tucked into a shopping center off Rainbow and the 215. \u000a\u000aMichaels has a lot to offer in regards to crafting and painting, etc. You can really get lost in this place looking for a specific item and then become intrigued by other crafty supplies. I went here specifically for watercolor paint which I am using to make decorations for my wedding. I ended up finding a few other items that I did not specifically need at the time, but I figured I'd buy them right then anyway to save myself another trip.\u000a\u000aThe store is a bit crowded, the aisles are somewhat small. I think they're trying to cram too much stuff into a small space. For instance, Hobby Lobby has a very big space, and probably just as much stuff as this Michaels, but it is easier to get around Hobby Lobby.\u000a\u000aAll in all this a good place to get your craftiness on. They also offer discounts via email, and you can find newspaper discount sometimes too. It's also always worth it to check out the clearance section.

VYes, yes, and more yes!\u000a\u000aI happened upon Sushi Imagine while reading Yelp reviews and the place had amazing reviews so I decided I just had to try it the next time I was out in Henderson. Typically my trips to Henderson involve a visit to The District, which is what I was doing today. Luckily Sushi Imagine is just a hop on the 2-15 from the shopping center, or just a street or two away. \u000a\u000aAt first I couldn't find it because my GPS was not being nice to me, but then I realized it was behind the McDonalds! If you get into the shopping center and can't find it... just look behind the fast food. ;)\u000a\u000aThe lunch specials, oh the lunch specials! Lunch specials for $5! And a big cup of soda for 95 cents! I opted though for the $7.95 lunch special - spicy tuna and california roll plus miso soup! Sure, they're kinda boring rolls, but for that price I couldn't pass them up! There are also other lunch specials where you can get a spicy tuna roll plus three nigiri!\u000a\u000aService was excellent and the sushi chef greets you as you enter! I absolutely adore this little sushi place (and yes, it is little) and I will be back for sure when I am in the Henderson area.

VHot dog bliss! My mother and I were trolling around looking for florists for my wedding and we happened to be driving down Sahara when we saw Tiger Lily Florist. We stopped in and inquired about flowers, but when we left I saw the bright yellow sign for "Hot Dog Haus" in the parking lot of Tony Roma's. I was feeling pretty hungry and so was my mom. We looked around and finally saw the bright yellow door of the Hot Dog Haus. It is connected to Cafe Hieldberg.\u000a\u000aOnce you open the door you enter a completely different world. It is not what I expected for a hot dog joint, but it totally fits the whole German attitude thing. \u000a\u000aMy mother and I both ordered a Chicago Dog, got chips and a drink. We awaited our hot dogs at one of the small tables to the right of the bar. The hot dogs were delicious with a crisp snap to them. These are Vienna hot dogs. Top notch here! The bright green relish was a treat and the spicy peppers added a bit of heat. Overall these dogs were delish! \u000a\u000aI have a feeling I will be back here very soon!

VI had a friend in town from Reno and really wanted to take him out to somewhere "Vegas-y" for dinner. I immediately thought that going to any of the places in the Cosmopolitan would be a winner as I really like the casino.\u000a\u000aSo, we arrived here on a Sunday night and sat at the bar. After the bartender scrutinized my very real Nevada driver's license for far too long, making me feel quite uncomfortable, we ordered two iced teas. I get the need to make sure you're serving people who are 21, and yes, I do realize I look young, but her examination of my DL made me feel awkward, especially considering we were at a hamburger joint... it's not like we were sitting down at the Chandelier Bar. \u000a\u000aI didn't feel like drinking at all because I just wanted to eat something tasty. I thought about getting one of the spiked milkshakes, but then after looking at the menu realized if I got a milkshake and a burger, my bill alone would be OVER $20. Ugh. Maybe I'm just a cheap-ass, I don't know, but these places in Vegas with their ridiculous prices for things like hamburgers and milkshakes are just irritating to me.\u000a\u000aANYWAY - I had the Hen House. I thought it was good. The burger is good quality. My friend had the New Dehli Chicken. He said it was good. But honestly we weren't raving over them or anything. I really expected to be awed or something and I really wasn't.\u000a\u000aI think there are better places for the "better burger"/expensive burger in Las Vegas. Burger Bar is one of them. I guess I'm just not impressed with their overly-creative burgers that come out on a plate looking minuscule and not worth how much you're paying for them. Maybe I'm just over this fad in Vegas where everything has to be totally different and weird. Maybe I just want a burger and fries and that's it. Maybe I'm just never going to be the person who thinks it is okay to charge $17 for a burger (no matter what is on it or what kind of beef it is made with).\u000a\u000aOverall, I would go back if someone wanted to go there. I wouldn't vote against the place, but if I had the choice - I don't think I'd think about coming here because I absolutely loved the place and the food.

VThis update/review is based on dining room seating and only ordering milkshakes.\u000a\u000aMy friend and I decided we needed something sweet after our lunch at Social House. I have never had any of the "Bamboozled" shakes at Holsteins, but considering I was right there at Cosmo and I wanted a milkshake...\u000a\u000aI had the Drunken Munkey. A favorite of my friend and well - it was delicious. I would go back for this shake, over and over again. It was perfect.\u000a\u000aOur server was nice too, even though we were just ordering shakes she didn't seem to mind. \u000a\u000aWe did have a hiccup at the hostess stand while attempting to sit in the lounge and being rebuffed, but I can let that slide since the milkshake was so good.\u000a\u000aWhen I come back next time it will be for some food and a milkshake.

VUpdating once again based on experiencing the BILLIONAIRE BURGER.\u000a\u000aMy friend and I ended up eating here because we came to Cosmopolitan to eat at Comme Ca, unfortunately SEMA was in town and Comme Ca was hosting an event in their dining room. Being that we did not want to sit and eat at the overly crowded bar at Comme Ca, we walked over to Holsteins. We had to wait for a seat here too so I was really freakin hungry when we sat down. \u000a\u000aOne bummer about this experience was they did not bring out any complimentary popcorn. *womp womp*\u000a\u000aOther than that our server was very nice and helpful. He knew the menu well. BUT. My friend and I knew we were getting the Billionaire Burger because we HAD to have a burger with foie gras in it. Yep. This burger comes with a big chunk of grilled foie gras right in the burger. It has Kobe beef with frisee, port-onion marmalade and truffle mayonnaise. DANG. If you don't feel like hitting the high-roller tables after this burger something is wrong with you. I also added some cheese to mine. \u000a\u000aWe also split the "Snickers, Please!" dessert, which was decent, but I would suggest going with one of their bomboozled milkshakes and have it WITH your burger instead.\u000a\u000aHolstein's does it RIGHT in the world of fancy burgers in Vegas.

VReview based on the bar and drinks only.\u000a\u000aOn a week night I went down to the Cosmo with a friend for a concert and to redeem free drinks at Comme Ca. They run contests on their Twitter to win two free drinks off of their 18a cocktail menus. Very cool of them.\u000a\u000aComme Ca is tucked into the corner of the restaurant level of The Cosmo. I really liked the bar area with the plethora of seating. The ambiance is very conducive to just coming here and having a few drinks with friends. Also, I believe it would be a very nice atmosphere for a date. \u000a\u000aI had the Rumble. A drink they make with season fruit (mine had raspberries), The fruit is "muddled" aka smashed down in the bottom of the glass, and alcohol is added and topped with crushed ice. The presentation was nothing short of spectacular. All cocktails are $12.\u000a\u000aNow I need to go back and try the food and perhaps sit on their outside patio they have!

VComme Ca gets another star! I met my friend down here because she won their Twitter contest again. Hey, it pays to be on Twitter these days!\u000a\u000aOn this occasion we were there on a pretty busy Saturday night. There was a family sitting in the lounge area with a young boy who was crying like a wild banshee and a mother doing absolutely nothing to stop this demon child from ruining the ear drums of all the patrons at the bar.\u000a\u000aLuckily for my friend and I the bartender felt bad for us having to deal with the angry toddler because he definitely cut us an awesome deal on our bar tab (plus the fact we already had two free drinks from Twitter). Oh, did I mention he made us free shots? Yah, we had a lot of awesome going on that night.\u000a\u000aI had the Sunflower - such a wonderful refreshing cocktail. I also had a whisky-based drink which packed quite a punch. I ended on a glass of Chardonnay. The bartender was nice enough to pour me a sample of the two types he had behind the bar and I selected the one I liked best. Ummm yes, I selected the much more expensive one without knowing the price. Haha, so just be aware they have some pricey wines back there. ;)\u000a\u000aThis is such a wonderful bar. It may be my favorite bar on the strip now!

VReview based on restaurant BRUNCH service on a Sunday afternoon at 12 PM.\u000a\u000aI was lured in by the Duck Confit Cinnamon Roll and ended up getting the Pre Fixe $20 brunch menu which includes an app, main course, and dessert. Honestly I should have just gotten the cinnamon roll and been done with it because I definitely did not need to eat that much food.\u000a\u000aMy friend and I were seated quickly, especially since there was hardly anyone else in the place. I will say that's okay because on The Strip most people are probably still sleeping of their hangovers at Noon on a Sunday. Our waitress quickly greeted us and took our drink order of two coffees. She was a very nice girl, although a bit spacey about coming around to check on us as our coffees got cold during the meal and had to be replaced with new ones.\u000a\u000aOn to the meals. I got the Pre Fixe. Started with the cinnamon roll that comes with a side of pork belly (picture added). I must say it did not disappoint me, it was decadent and delicious. I did not eat all of it for fear I would never be able to finish the rest of my meal. On to the quiche du jour, which that day was bacon, spinach, and cheese. I must say the quiche was undeniably delicious. It was perfectly cooked with a flaky pastry crust. It was not heavy, nor was it too light. The spinach was perfect and addicting. And lastly I somehow managed to have a few bites of my profiteroles. They were perfectly served with drizzled chocolate sauce and outstanding ice creams which are made on-site. The pistachio was definitely my favorite.\u000a\u000aSo everything was delicious correct? Correct. Unfortunately the service was lackluster. Two coffees getting cold over and over again is just not a good sign. Especially when the restaurant is so empty! And lastly, as it must be mentioned my friend ordered the Ox Tail Eggs Benedict and alas, somehow, someway they left out the Ox Tail! How is that possible? I have no idea.\u000a\u000aI do love Comme Ca and I have written glowing reviews in the past. However, my first dining experience was not the best. I will not rule them out though because the food was very good and I enjoy their bar and cocktail happy hours. I will try it again because I still want to try their famous hamburger. I just hope service is a bit better next time.

VComme Ca has a very special place in my heart. I have been to the bar and restaurant on countless occasions. I tend to wander here if I'm in the Cosmo whether or not I have come to the Cosmo specifically to come to Comme Ca or not. \u000a\u000aMy most recent trip was to the bar for happy hour, a happy hour I have experienced in the past - but with drinks only. This time I went with an empty belly, ready to eat and drink.\u000a\u000aOrdered - Their quite famous Comme Ca burger, and it was delicious. Ordered medium well and I asked to have them hold back on the amount of fries. As noted by my friend with whom I was dining, she mentioned the sheer amount of fries they put on the plate would be overwhelming. \u000a\u000aThe burger was simply delicious and not too big, nor too small. It was quite perfect actually. It comes with two sauces - a white kind, not sure what it was, and ketchup. The french fries were so on spot I cannot say a bad thing about them. I ate all of them. *FATTY* - No really, I hardly ever eat all the fries that are presented to me at restaurants, but I could not resist these ones.\u000a\u000aDrinks - I ordered from their 18A cocktail menu. Both drinks I had were vodka based - the first being a minty refreshing concotion made with a splash of champagne and the second was the aviation, a drink I commonly order at cocktail bars. Comme Ca did me good with both drinks. \u000a\u000aI cannot wait to return for another happy hour trip. I shall explore their menu further.

VI've come full circle at Comme Ca. Happy hour (drinks only), happy hour (drinks and food), brunch, and now dinner. \u000a\u000aMy friend and I arrived at Comme Ca with a reservation, which I recommend at any time during the week because at one point I attempted coming here for dinner and there was a private party being held. My plans were ruined.\u000a\u000aHowever, everything came to fruition a few nights ago and I dined with a friend at Comme Ca for dinner.\u000a\u000aAppetizer - Hudson Valley Seared Foie Gras - perfectly seared, amazingly rich, beautifully plated. Comes served between a waffle and butternut squash, accompanied by berries and radishes. Indulgent. Perfect.\u000a\u000aMain - BOUILLABAISSE of amazingness. Octopus, venus clams, gulf shrimp, and mussels, with a salty, briny, soup, and two crusty pieces of bread spread with garlic butter. I ate every bit. I supped on the soupy goodness. I scraped every morsel of meat out of every shell. The shrimp were on point. The octopus was tender. I am in love with this dish. \u000a\u000aTwo glasses of riesling to wash it all down. Lovely varietal, $10 a glass.\u000a\u000aComme Ca, yes, yes, yes.

VI've been to Smashburger a total of three times. Two of them happened to be at this particular location on Maryland Parkway right next to the UNLV campus. My experiences have been "okay" but more like... hey, I've had better burgers than this experiences. Therefore the 2-star rating must be awarded, especially after the visit I had last night after work.\u000a\u000aAll day I was looking forward to trying out the Baja Burger. I wanted something spicy, something meaty, something satisfying. I figured - this would be it! I was wrong. The burger was actually quite bland, unless I happened to be biting into a jalapeno. There was only a couple times I said, "Hey, that's spicy" and even less times I thought "This burger is totally worth the price I paid for it". \u000a\u000aI suppose Smash-fans are lovers of all the toppings you can apply to burgers here. Perhaps the different sides you can pair with your burger as well. But to me - it's just not worth the price tag.\u000a\u000aBaja Burger - 5.99\u000aSmash Fries - 1.99\u000aCoke - 1.89\u000aTotal - $11+\u000a\u000aNote that Smashburger does NOT make combos. You must order these things separate. Almost 12 bucks for a burger combo? No thanks. I'll go to a sit down restaurant, pay that much and then leave a bit more for a tip. That would be better than this.\u000a\u000aOverall the food was NOT BAD. The burger's bun was actually the most enjoyable thing I had. The Smash fries were not what I expected. Yes, I tasted the rosemary, but not so much the garlic. Plus my fries were teeny tiny fries! Like, I had gotten the bottom of the entire batch! I just cannot say I was satisfied and I can say I probably would have been more satisfied if I had just gone to Inn N Out next door.  \u000a\u000a3 strikes. Sorry Smashburger, you're outta my rotation.

VSage 75 drink is amazing! Try it!\u000a\u000aWith that being said this glamorous bar located in the center of The Cosmopolitan is a sparkly masterpiece. It is just plush and classy, there's no denying that. Are the drinks overpriced? Yes, absolutely. But if you're going here and expecting cheap drinks something is wrong with you.\u000a\u000aThe only downgrade to this bar is the large amount of tourists that flock to it and seriously some of them are straight up rude. But the bartenders here take it in stride. And the best part is, these bartenders know what they're doing - I've never had a bad drink at Chandelier. Thank you Cosmo, this one is a knockout.

VI do love the Cosmopolitan in all its hip trendiness, catering to the younger Vegas crowd and providing some exceptional experiences. This bar (and sports book AND concert venue) does meet expectations of what I would expect from The Cosmo.\u000a\u000aI attended a FREEEEE concert here last night, and although I was not in the least interested in the music being played I must give props to this place for offering free concerts, and good acts. I don't believe you'd see a cheesy lounge singer in this place. Other great points include the seating: comfy swivel chair and couches, along with: cutest drum tables EVER! Whoever was designing this place: good job! Although I do think the stage could have been set up a *bit* better. I get the idea that it is supposed to be novel that the stage is behind the bar, but listening to live music is supposed to be an experience between entertainer and crowd. I think the entertainer loses some of this, and the crowd feels it too. There's just a disconnect there. I believe seeing a band in a venue where you can stand right up at the stage and really feel the band's presence and emotions brings a concert goer exactly what the want in a concert experience.\u000a\u000aAlso - service was bad at the bar. I mean... B A D. Not even "okay". My friends and I sauntered up to an open space, just to buy some drinks and sit down and we were ungraciously ignored by the entire bar staff. I mean literally, they just didn't even notice we were there. OR they just didn't bother to come up to us until my friend asked someone directly if he would like to get us a drink. SHEESH. You gotta ask to be served? Unacceptable. However - I must say this was somewhat fixed by the attentive service of the cocktail waitresses during the concert. They were very nice young ladies and were quick to refill drinks and make sure everyone had drinks flowing.\u000a\u000aSo, I do like this place. However, the poor service and the disconnect between audience and band are just not enough for me to give it anything more than an "okay" rating.

VI just wanted to do a quick update of this venue as I was here again a couple weekends ago to see another FREE-99 band perform.\u000a\u000aAgain I must say I love that Book & Stage does these free concerts. Last band I saw here was good and attracted some very interesting fans. That is kind of one of the best things about this venue - people watching. You get a wide range of people to look at and be amused by.\u000a\u000aTheir drink menu is eclectic as well and has something for everyone. Their original cocktails are fun to read about, even if you're not going to drink them. Yes, they are a bit pricey, but we're talking about sitting in a bar at The Cosmo here.\u000a\u000aStill very much a fan of Book & Stage. They have earned a special place in my heart.

VThis bar has a rather 70s Hollywood feel to it. The colors really reminded me of the brown and orange hues so popular in that era. What I really enjoyed were the large seating areas dispersed throughout the area. \u000a\u000aI met my host for Marquee here so I did not have any drinks. The bar is easily accesible from the casino floor and I imagine it isn't as popular as say the Chandelier or Bond. So, if you're in Cosmo and you'd rather have a more chill experience I think this might be the place to do it. \u000a\u000aI'd like to go back on one of my many return trips to The Cosmo.

VI've been in a few Guitar Centers in my day, but never in this one at Town Square. When my husband and I entered I was quite surprised by the amount of instruments in here. The place is set up as eye candy for a musician and even the every day folk as well.\u000a\u000aYou can wander the store and check out guitars, drum sets, pianos, keyboards, and mixing equipment. The space is expansive, much bigger than you would believe from the outside. The sales floor allows patrons to engross themselves in an instrument and be left alone by sales people. While my husband and I were there we tried out several keyboards.\u000a\u000aGuitar Center also does price matching, which is always a plus with retail stores. They also offer a military discount.\u000a\u000aMy husband ended up purchasing a keyboard, stand, and a few beginners books here. The sales person who helped us was nice because he was actually from the guitar area, not the keyboard area. But when we were trying to get help from anyone in that area, no one was around. So at least the employees here will go out of their way to help you.\u000a\u000aOverall I'm a fan and would return just to browse and look even if I weren't buying anything.

VThe girl who never, never, NEVER clubs went to a club.\u000a\u000aLong story short I had a group of girls/cousins come into Las Vegas for a bachelorette party. They needed a club to go to on Monday night - Marquee is open on Monday night - 1 star!\u000a\u000aOn Yelp I asked for some help to find a promoter/host for a club on a Monday night and I was referred to Gia Lee at Marquee - found her on Facebook and got all 17 girls into the club, VIP line, with open bar from 10 pm to 11 pm - 1 more star!\u000a\u000aAlthough I am NOT a club-goer (I used to be) I do LOVE The Cosmopolitan, and since I have high expectations for places in the Cosmo, Marquee was no exception. And Marquee delivered. I loved the look and layout of the club, plenty of accessible bars, an outside and indoor dancing area. The pool part of the club was especially my favorite. 1 more star!\u000a\u000aMy complaint #1 is the same complaint for ALL Las Vegas clubs; even with being guest listed my group STILL had to wait in a line. It's just annoying. I wish they would stream-line the process. If I'm going through a promoter, why can't she just walk me in? Why do I have to deal with the club-thugs (as I like to call them)? *sigh* I guess it's all part of the "experience".\u000a\u000aComplaint #2 and this is a big one. When I went to leave the club I left by myself. I went directly to the elevators that I had come up in. The club-thugs at the elevators pointed me to a flight of stairs. WHAT. THE. F*CK. Yes, the profanity is definitely needed. ARE YOU KIDDING ME, MARQUEE? How dare your club-thugs make me use a flight of stairs in high-heels and drunk. Even at The Palms they let you take the elevator back down (yes, it is many more stories), but STILL. That needs to stop immediately. If it weren't for that ending I probably would have given 4-stars.

VReview of: $22.13 Pre-Fixe Lunch Menu 2013\u000a\u000aMy friend and I have attempted to eat the Pre-Fixe at Milos before, back when it was $20.13. Indeed, they have upped the price, but I don't think $2 is much more for what you are getting. However, if they upped the price anymore than that I would think twice about coming here for this particular Pre=Fixe.\u000a\u000aI believe one of the best ways to eat well, in fancy places, and get the bang for your buck is to eat happy hours, lunch, and Pre-Fixe menus. Numerous fancy-dancy places in Vegas offer these menus in their "off" times (IE: not dinner) and this accommodates especially locals very well. I imagine the meal I had at this particular lunch would have set me back a whole lot more than 20 bucks-ish had I been dining during a "dinner" time at Milos. With that being said, onto the food:\u000a\u000aFirst Course - Meze Plate\u000aComes with three sauce, pita bread, cheese, one tomato and one olive. I really wanted another kalamata olive. Why just one Milos?! Why?! Oh right, presentation or something probably. I chose the meze plate because I wanted an option to just get my palate going before I had my main course. The other first courses on the menu are quite sumptuous (scallops, octopus, etc.) However, the meze plate eases you into your meal in a nice way, being able to play with which flavors you slather onto your pita bread. I enjoyed the dish and the presentation.\u000a\u000aSecond Course - Sea Bass\u000aA fish you'll wish you could eat every time you eat fish. It is presented sliced in half, tail and head still attached (please do what you can to scrape some meat out of the head - I did!). The flavor is - buttery, meaty white fish. If you don't know what that tastes like, then order this dish and enjoy. My fish did not have too many bones, I believe I probably ran into about 5-6. However, my friend's fish seemed to be loaded, so just be careful when eating.\u000a\u000aThird Course - Walnut Cake\u000aMeh. I was not impressed and wished I had ordered another dessert. This cake was dry and tasted like gingerbread. I'm not a fan. The ice cream on top was the only reason I could stomach the whole piece. Had the ice cream not been on top I would have just left it on the plate after the first couple bites.\u000a\u000aService - Genteel, warm, friendly, upscale, quick, we were not forgotten, nor were we hovered over. When we arrived the place was empty, when we left it was totally full. So kudos to management and servers for keeping a service exceptional through a lunch rush.\u000a\u000aOverall - A decent Pre-Fixe to try out. Since Milos specializes in seafood, those who may not want to dump a whole lot of money into such a specialized restaurant should consider the Pre-Fixe option and then decide whether or not they would return for full price. Now, if I had a hankering for seafood and had some extra money to throw around I would definitely return to Milos, probably with out-of-town friends to wow them.

VI know, I am the 9,999,999th person to review this place, right? But I just had to because I want to sing its praises. I love this pizza. I love it sober, and buzzed, and drunk, and REALLY drunk. It's a pizza for all occasions! \u000a\u000aI have eaten at the Pizzeria or "Secret Pizza" about 5 or 6 times, all on differing occasions of having been at the Cosmo drinking or working or just hanging out and needing something to munch on. \u000a\u000aLook, I'm not a pizza expert. I don't go around bashing deep dish or praising New York style or what have you, but I do like to eat pizza. A lot. So I guess the Pizzeria is your typical "New York" style pizza. Thin, crunchy, big slices you can fold up. I've had many different types, just cheese, pepperoni and sausage, and their pizza made with their white sauce - mmmm! Very good and typically I don't like white sauce on my pizza!\u000a\u000aAll in all I love this place. I love that it's secret and that it is in the Cosmo. I just can't get enough of it and I will be sad when I no longer live in Las Vegas and cannot get these yummy slices of heaven.

VUpon visiting the Pizzeria (aka Secret Pizza as I enjoy calling it) I was a bit miffed at the service. Typically when I have been here the service has been consistent with the nice guys working the pizza ovens and whoever happens to be cashiering.\u000a\u000aI went with some friends to get a slice of pizza before the Foster The People concert on a Thursday night. When we were there the place wasn't too busy, luckily. When we walked up to the counter they were right then bringing a pepperoni pizza out of the oven, so we all got a slice of that pizza.\u000a\u000aHowever, when I went up to pay the (obviously) unhappy girl at the register was fairly rude to me. Previously before my friends had gotten there I ordered a Coke and had been drinking it. I simply asked if I could have some more ice in my Coke, and pretty snottily she asked me if I also wanted a refill. Well, sure, yes I said and she got me the refill. \u000a\u000aHonestly I hate to drop stars of places because someone may have been having a bad day, but I've read reviews of this place that have noted the service at the counter has been less than nice. Therefore I stand by dropping my 5 star rating to a 4 star for now.

VSecret Pizza has not so secretly upped its prices. Secretly they have skimped on employees during peak hours and therefore they have not so secretly become not so fantastic. At least, to me.\u000a\u000aLast night I went here with a few friends and I have not been in awhile. Shelling out $5 for a slice of pizza is beyond me. I guess I'd just rather go to Holstein's or Comme Ca and shell out 5 more dollars for something better. \u000a\u000aI'm not saying I'm never going to eat here again, but I won't be going out of my way to seek a slice any longer. \u000a\u000aOne bonus - at least they have a water dispenser now.

VAs far as government buildings go this place is actually quite nice. It is not hard to find and the parking lot is large. A big plus is, you do not have to meter, which I was afraid I was going to have to do. The structure itself is fairly modern, the inside is cavernous and minimal in design. There's a few different entrances so if you go in one entrance you may end up in a hallway of doom and not know where you are at all (this happened to me).\u000a\u000aFortunately the security guard was more than happy to direct me to where I was headed and even walked me halfway down a few of the winding hallways so I wouldn't get lost.\u000a\u000aI came here for an assessment for a job. I'm not sure what else goes on in here, but if for some reason you have business to do here, at least it is a clean, well-kept building, and there is no security to go through either, so that's a plus.

VIf you're in The Venetian and you need a quick bite, the pizza here just may be right up your alley. It's located right off the main casino floor, near the front registration desk. It's nestled in a small food court.\u000a\u000aTh slices are pricey, will likely run you $5+ (more money if you add toppings or get specialty slices). The day I was there I had 2 slices: mushroom and pepperoni and a two cheese/basil combo. Both were thin and were heated up in their oven. Overall I enjoyed them, but for $12.97 - man, they better have tasted good!\u000a\u000aComparable to Secret Pizza @ Cosmo, but definitely lacking. The tastes are about the same, with Secret PIzza winning by a hair. However, Secret Pizza's prices are obviously much more friendly than this little pizzeria. \u000a\u000aAnd for those not interested in pizza, they do serve other Italian dishes, which appeared to me to look dissatisfying to say the least.

VI'm not a huge fan of Gap clothing in general, but sometimes I find myself heading here for a few items of clothing. This time I was in search of white dress shirts and black slacks. I knew Gap would have these items. Lucky me, they did have what I needed and on sale! 50% off sales! This outlet store knows what it means to be an outlet store. Low prices with even more mark downs.\u000a\u000aI even picked up a couple pairs of work out pants because I was saving so much money.\u000a\u000aEvery employee I encountered was helpful and cheerful. I can't give 5 stars because I felt as though some parts of the store were a tad messy and crowded. Other than that, I loved it and would recommended, especially if you're looking for good deals on clothes.

VI am surprised this place does not have a review yet!\u000a\u000aLiving Social offered a deal a few months back for three laser treatments at a very low prices and I jumped on it quickly. They are booked out so much I had to wait quite awhile to get an appointment. However, the wait was worth it!\u000a\u000aWith my deal I decided to get three laser hair removal treatments for my underarms. I arrived a bit early and filled out paperwork. The girls at the front desk were a tad inattentive, as I sat in the front room for awhile. However, all that changed when my laser surgeon came out and introduced herself. Oh, I can't believe I don't remember her name, she has blond hair and glasses. She was very nice and reassuring of the whole process.\u000a\u000aI will not go into the details once we actually got into the room to perform the procedure, but let's just say she made me feel very comfortable.\u000a\u000aOverall I enjoyed my experience and I look forward to going back for my next couple treatments!

VWent to Downtown Vintage Guitars last night to see the Tingerlz play. This place is pretty cool and is interesting for a venue to see a show. It is a guitar shop/bar/venue. How cool is that? The inside is funky and has different seating from bar stools to cushy chairs. It isn't too big, it isn't too small. The decor is nice to look at and it wasn't smokey. I don't believe they allow smoking in the venue. \u000a\u000aThe show last night was not overly crowded so there was plenty of room to sit and watch the band. There was no wait at the bar and the selection was okay. Don't expect anything extravagant. I did get a Sierra Nevada for only $3! Oh ya, they don't charge a cover at the door. No cover + cheap drinks = Good time!\u000a\u000aOnly complaint would have to be the parking situation and the surrounding areas are a bit shady. But I suppose you're going to run into that being that it is downtown. I actually had to park behind people and other people parked behind me, it creates a bit of a blocking someone else in sort of thing, but there's really no other choice, as the surrounding areas are apartments and I am sure the residents there would have no qualms about having your car towed ASAP. However - I assumed since the place was so small and intimate there would really be no problem to get whoever happened to be blocking you in to move their car once you wanted to leave. Don't know if it would be an issue if there were more people there.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a great place to see a show! Have not been here for any guitar related issues, since I don't play so I can't comment on that part of their business.

VI've had Due Forni on my list for awhile. When I noted they were participating in Restaurant Week 2013 I knew this would be my time to go since it is in a completely different side of town from where I live. \u000a\u000aThere were some pros and cons to my experience which leads to my decision of rewarding the A-OK rating. I mean, was it terrible? No. Was it great? No. So I have to go halfway.\u000a\u000aPros: \u000a\u000a- Delicious Sweet Bufala Ricotta - complete with toasted pistachios and artisanal honey. Honestly my dessert was the best part of my meal. It was savory with a bit of sweet and the perfect portion for a dessert to end your meal. If anything, I'd come back specifically to have this dessert item.\u000a\u000a- The restaurant dutifully upheld RW menu and brought my friend and I everything we ordered. The waiter was bland, but not discriminate against us when we informed him we would be dining on the RW menu (I've had this experience at other places). \u000a\u000a- Although service was indeed slow and our waiter was incredibly scripted and boring he did not push wine or an upgrade of our meals, which I was afraid of since I have noted in other reviews patrons felt as though they were being upsold during their whole meal, which is annoying, of course.\u000a\u000a- My friend and I dined outside on their patio which is always a nice alternative if it's available and not 100 degrees outside.\u000a\u000aCons:\u000a\u000a- Insalata with mixed greens, artichokes and olives was underwhelming and I had to spit out two pieces of artichokes that had the hard exterior still on them.\u000a\u000a- Oven Roasted Chicken with Potatoes and Spring Onions. I could not stomach the onions, one bite and I knew they were not being eaten. Maybe it's just my personal preference. The potatoes were the star of the dish. I might as well have just asked for a plate of starch, rather than having the chicken, which albeit had an interesting flavor, was so small I couldn't believe I was done with it and still hungry. Also, I can make better tasting chicken in my own kitchen. A lot better.\u000a\u000a- Service as stated above was bland and seemed extremely rehearsed. \u000a\u000a- Menus are paper and placed in front of you during the entirety of your meal. Perhaps to remind you just how much you are paying for your authentically mediocre Italian food. Paper menus are silly and honestly a slap in the face to most people who believe in being enviro friendly. What is so hard about laminating and reusing?\u000a\u000aLastly...\u000a\u000aSo I did not have the pizza, which is their forte, of course, but I was quite disappointed in my experience. Also, I noted the chicken I had was not even on the actual menu. It seemed odd to me - did they just make up this dish for RW and slap it on the dinner menu, or is perhaps on the lunch menu? Either way, it's an odd thing in my opinion.\u000a\u000aWould I return? Only if I was specifically invited by someone. I would never return on my own volition.

VI came to this Grimaldi's for a lunch meeting with a client. She picked the place and I delivered my manager so the meal would be free-99. \u000a\u000aI have eaten at Grimaldi's in the past at Boca Park and I really, really enjoyed it. There were a few kinks to my experience at this one on Rainbow that has me kind of weary of trying it again.\u000a\u000aWhen we first entered there was an odd smell to the air, kind of like there might be an open sewer line somewhere, but also a possibility of leakage somewhere in the restaurant due to recent rains. Either way - no good.\u000a\u000aWe were escorted to our table and ordered waters with lemon and the Caprese Salad to start. Tomatoes were incredibly fresh and meaty, paired with big chunks of mozz and fragrant basil. Drizzled with olive oil, this was a nice starter.\u000a\u000aOur pizza: We ordered the white pizza, with extra cheese, spicy sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, and tomatoes. Maybe this is where we went wrong -- to me the combo was a bit too much. \u000a\u000aThe crust was thin and crispy, but really chewy, more chewy than I would like. Hard to pull away from with just your teeth and/or hands, and hard to cut with a fork and knife. I was grinding my knife down into it and making those scratchy sounds against my plate.\u000a\u000aThe place is cute, but I thought the wall decor was kind of tacky, it also is very vacant-looking so there isn't a really nice "homey" feel to it you might expect at a pizza joint.\u000a\u000aOverall - this place is far from where I live, so I would not go out of my way to come here. I am not saying I will never have Grimaldi's again, but this experience was only okay.

VArtifice is a lovely spot for a drink in the downtown area. It is located behind The Arts Factory off 1st Street and Charleston. It is a large space, which looks like it could have been a warehouse in the past. The ceilings are large, the flooring is wood. It is very open when you walk in, which is a very different experience from most Vegas bars which tend to make you feel cramped.\u000a\u000aThe bartenders are friendly and the people hanging out here are nice. I had a few really good conversations with the people sitting around me drinking. \u000a\u000aAs I was leaving it sounded like a band was setting up to play. A little local music is happening here too. I will be making return trips.

VOh at last I made the trek out to 5 Guys to try this place out. I brought my Mom with me as she is a burger connoisseur. Well, not really, she just likes burgers. We arrived at about 11:30 AM and the place was slammed. Lots of police officers (oh and by the way, when we left a fire truck pulled up and firefighters piled out to go inside. Damn, missed 'em!)\u000a\u000aSo I was really expecting this place to knock my socks off and it didn't really. It reminds me of an Inn N Out, except the staff act like they're all on speed, yelling and there's just a lot of commotion going on behind the counter. I guess it was kind of interesting to watch them work, but the longer I sat there, the more I thought, "well this must get old quick."\u000a\u000aAnyway, the service was good even with all the commotion. My mother and I both ordered Cheeseburgers, okay here comes my big complaint: I did not know that ordering a Cheeseburger would mean I get TWO PATTIES. Why doesn't it say that on their menu? I was confused by the "Cheeseburger" and "Little Cheeseburger" on the menu. I just assumed the little cheeseburger was perhaps a bit smaller than the normal one. But no - my mother and I get surprised with double patties of meat. I like my meat just as much as anyone else, but I really do not like double burgers. Really wish I had known this.\u000a\u000aOkay, so minus the fact we were tricked into double burgers - the cheeseburger itself was juicy - plus! I decided to go all out and get mine "All The Way", lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, pickles, mayo, ketchup, and mustard. My mom went more conservative - lettuce, tomato, mustard, and pickles. I kinda wish I'd gone more conservative, but that's my own fault. The burger itself WAS GOOD. I will go out and say I liked it better than Smashburger. However, I think it was about on-par with Inn N Out.\u000a\u000aAs for the fries, I am not a "natural cut" french fries fan. My favorite fries come from Inn N Out. So, I guess it's more of a personal preference. I'm not saying they were bad, but they are just not my cup of tea.\u000a\u000aI think I would go back here so I could try one of their hot dogs, but I'd skip the fries, AND I would definitely order the LITTLE Cheeseburger. So, with all the hype, this place only gets 3 stars from me. Perhaps I'm just more attuned to a West Coast style burger joint. I do know that 5 Guys originated on the East Coast. It makes me wonder if this location in Las Vegas is lacking what they may bring to the table out on the East Coast? Hmmm, something to ponder.

VI'm going to roll back my expected 5-Star rating to a four. Maybe I'm slightly a prude? Heck, I worked the Adult Video Conference, walked the floor and saw strippers gyrating on each other and yet, Absinthe made me feel just a teeny bit more awkward! Now I guess that's a compliment to what this show really is, because it is definitely raunchy, dirty fun! \u000a\u000aFirst off the show was amazing for what it is. A tiny circus tent filled with BIG talent. The performers were absolutely amazing and performed all their acts to a tee. I am always amazed by what the human body can do. These performers deserved the standing ovation they deserved at the end of the show.\u000a\u000aAs for the racy part of the show. Well, just don't bring your parents, okay? I don't mind F-Bombs or even the occasional sexual joke, but Absinthe is just brimming over the top with them. As in bubbling over. I'd personally like my dirty jokes scaled back just a bit. \u000a\u000aOh yes, no one is safe by the way. The Gazillionaire will be happy to pull people from the audience to completely embarrass them on-stage. Please be willing to do whatever he says. The night we were there the audience member he selected was not going the distance and it was quite lame.\u000a\u000aAll in all, I did enjoy it. Would I go back and see it again? Yes. I'd like to take my boyfriend because I think it may be the only show on the Strip he would actually be willing to go see.

VFinally got to try out Whiskey Dick's after getting a Living Social deal. \u000a\u000aAlthough my friend and I were unable to use the Living Social deal toward the Happy Hour prices (44 cent wings, half off their pizzas) we got happy hour food anyway. Between my friend and I we shared one of their 12-inch pizzas, and an order of 10 medium wings. I'm going to give the food 3-stars. Just A-Okay. I wasn't in any gluttonous joy while eating the food. It's pretty straight on for a bar though. Their menu though - hilarious! They've come up with some funny names for their food. Totally worth it to read through the whole menu before ordering just for the sake of reading the names of everything and the descriptions.\u000a\u000aThe bar itself gets the extra star tacked on for my overall rating. It's a huge bar and snakes all the way around the place. Looked totally different from what I was expecting. My friend and I were there on a Friday night and the happy hour crowd was providing lots of entertainment (people dancing, loud rock n roll music coming from the juke box). Before we left there was also a band setting up, so I guess they get live music later in the night which is pretty cool.\u000a\u000aSince the bar is new it is clean. It's still dark, but you can tell it is not dirty and is well taken care of. There isn't that bar grime there yet which comes with age (or just poor upkeep). It's a cool place to grab a brew and some bar food.

VI'm not entirely sure why I keep returning to Famous Dave's. Is it the ease of the establishment? The name brand? I don't know. Their BBQ is not the best, nor is it the worst, but I am certain I could find better BBQ, even in Vegas, if I tried a little harder. I guess I'm just lazy.\u000a\u000aI came here with my mom, niece, and a friend for dinner. The place was busy, and it was the middle of the week. Our waitress was nice and brought our food out quickly. \u000a\u000aMy friend got a rack of ribs, my niece got hot wings, I got the rib tips, and my mother got the brisket. We all ended up ordering broccoli for a side and I got their mac n cheese. I have to admit, their mac n cheese is really good. It has jalapeno chopped up in it. As for my meat, I was, as usual, somewhat disappointed. Most of it was too hard to even bite off. What the hecks? Why doesn't it just fall right off? I get it, it's the tips, so they're kind of like burnt ends... but I DID NOT order burnt ends! They don't even serve those.. I don't think so anyway.\u000a\u000aMy mom said her brisket was good and my friend said the ribs were pretty good too.\u000a\u000aI just think there's better BBQ to be had elsewhere. Some mom and pop shop somewhere in this big city is waiting for me to find their delicious BBQ....

VOriginally I was going to do two reviews on Insert Coins because I went to the grand opening and recently returned. I've averaged out my ratings of the two nights:\u000a\u000aOpening Night: 5 Stars\u000aThe night I went last week: 3 Stars\u000a\u000aSo, overall this venue is receiving a 4-Star rating from me. I love old schools video games and nerdy nuance, and boy does this place speak to me. Drinks, video games, a lax dress code, but a very cool vibe all rolled into one.\u000a\u000aOn opening night they served up drinks in huge water glasses and it was a delight. However, be warned - they have down-sized to normal sized glasses and in my opinion, their beers are somewhat pricey ($6 for a bottle of Blue Moon, not even a draft!). However, I guess in part you are paying for the great ambiance and cleanliness offered to you at a very new and intriguing venue to be added to the bar scene on Fremont.\u000a\u000aMy complaint for my return trip actually comes from the fact that a lady bartender snubbed my friend before I got there. My friend told me she basically did the usual "girl bartender ignores girl patrons" at the bar game. That's why I dislike lady bartenders. And I'm a girl, and yes, I'm saying this - I'd much rather have a drink served to me by a man. Deal with it.\u000a\u000aThankfully when I arrived at the bar I was served by a male bartender (red hat, tattoos on the arms); thanks for the quick and attentive service! You made up for the snotty attitude of the first bartender.\u000a\u000aI am planning a return trip to Insert Coins for my birthday celebration this weekend. Can't wait to get my drink and my old school video game playing on! Overall, I do love Insert Coins, but just a word to the owner: Make sure your bartenders check themselves before they wreck your venue.

VBrought my out of town cousin here to hang out and play some video games. Although he's not much of a gamer he was impressed by the layout of the place and he thought the multi-colored bar was pretty sweet.\u000a\u000aWe were served by an amicable lady bartender who mixed me up a nice shot with Crown in it. My cousin did a Crown straight. As it was his birthday bash here in Vegas I was trying to show him a few different places other than just the strip. \u000a\u000aWhenever I go in here lately it is empty! I think I just go early though and get there before the rush. I still like it though and will maintain my 4-Star Rating. I think as this bar settles into itself and into the culture of Fremont East it will be an awesome establishment with a very good following of regulars and a steady stream of tourists.

V20 minutes to wait for food from a food truck at a very busy strEATS event - okay. \u000a\u000aTo wait 45 minutes - NOT OKAY.\u000a\u000aI really wanted to like Muncheeze truck because I love, love, love cheese! When I started following their Twitter and saw that there was a new menu I decided I would go down and try it out. To my surprise this Vegas strEATS was packed! I guess it's gotten a lot more popular since I went to the first couple times.\u000a\u000aThe Muncheeze truck line was long, but I figured, hey, it's a food truck, they serve out the food pretty fast. I waited in a long line at Lulu's before, but the wait wasn't too bad. Boy was I wrong on that account. Look, the people taking the orders were super nice, I'll give them that, but the guys in the truck making the food? They just looked like they were pissed and moving at a glacial pace as everyone outside their truck stood around and sweltered in the heat.\u000a\u000aThe food did not make me happy either. I opted for their version of a tuna melt. Welp, it was not melty. Yes, it had tuna in it, but sheesh, there wasn't even any melted-goodness cheese going on! I also got the buffalo cheese curds. The curds were inventive and good, but I wish they had been more ooey gooey rather than rubbery. Luckily I opted to take my food home and popped it in the microwave - 20 seconds later, voila! My curds were actually perfect. \u000a\u000aI've done a sampling of a few of the food trucks here in town and I gotta say Muncheeze is now at the bottom of my list. I suggest they start putting a little more effort into the food.... I think they have a novel idea, but gotta work on it guys.

VBoulder Station (and the other Stations) got rid of Coco's and have brought back their "Grand Cafes". Look, Boulder Station is basically 5 minutes from where I live, so if I feel the need for a quick, cheap dinner on the fly - Boulder Station it is. Since BS brought back the old Grand Cafe I figured I might as well give it a go, along with my parents.\u000a\u000aFirst off, the menu is basically the same old cafe menu you'll see anywhere. Breakfast (served 24-hours), main dishes, sandwiches, and desserts. Not a whole lot going on here, but hey, it's just a normal little cafe.\u000a\u000aThe service is far improved from Coco's. Whenever I went here in the past the hostess was rude, the waiters were mediocre, and you had to wave down people constantly to get refills or anything for that matter. Our waiter was a very nice guy, but he did not refill drinks and he did not come back to ask us how our meal was. He showed up at the beginning and he showed up at the end. It's just a good thing I wasn't super thirsty and only drank one glass of tea... speaking of the tea...\u000a\u000aIt was bland and it needs work. If you're going to serve tea, at least get it right. Mine and my mother's were too watery, too much ice. On to the food, my father ordered a spinach and mushroom omelet. It came out looking EXACTLY like the picture in the menu and my dad said it was really good. My mother and I ordered the $8.99 Prime Rib Special. My mom got french fries, I got mashed potatoes (mmm the gravy on the potatoes was delish!). The prime rib was cooked perfectly and it was BIIIIG. No skimping on their prime ribs here. It was served with veggies (meh) and au jus, as well as horseradish. \u000a\u000aSo overall I'm pleased with the Grand Cafe and will return many times because it is so close, convenient, and hey, if my parents are going to pay the bill for a meal - I am down.

VThis weekend was full of catching up with old friends and meeting new friends for me. I love having those kinds of weekends. I went here last night with a group of friends. We decided on this place because it is in Town Square and is convenient. \u000a\u000aI enjoyed my time here. All of the girls in the group got the ABC flight of wines. It stand for "Anything But Chardonnay". So basically a group of three white wines, served cold. I personally enjoyed this grouping a lot. The beginning glass to the last glass was perfect, it fit the palette correctly. I ended the night with a glass of Riesling. \u000a\u000aWe started out inside at the large round table in the back. I felt as though we were the Knights of the Round Table. The place itself is nice, the chairs are cushy and comfortable. We ended our night outside on the patio, which I thought was lovely. The only complaint would be the battling music going on with this place being between Yard House and Nu Sanctuary... it was just kind of annoying to be getting hit with three different booming music systems. \u000a\u000aI think the prices are bit out of range for this place being in Town Square. I believe their other store front is in Palazzo, which would make sense for the prices. But I think the owners must not have done any price changes at all, which I think they should consider if they want to continue to be successful in Town Square.

VMy update: Still holding at 3 stars firmly.\u000a\u000aI met up with a couple friends here last night for happy hour. Overall the place hasn't changed much, it's still the romantic ambiance and sexily dressed waitresses. Their happy hour prices for alcohol were great. I chose to get a Stella, my friends opted for wine. Our waitress was upbeat and attended to our needs very well.\u000a\u000aAs for the food, I'm just going to have to say... 3.5 stars. So, a little bump for their happy hour and food, mostly because the quesadilla had really good flavor and was very different from any quesadilla I've had. Unfortunately the quesadilla is not on the happy hour menu, to which I implore management - please put it on there! During the course of the night I also had the olives (meh), and the BBQ Pork Sliders (also meh, but kudos for the sweet pickles!). The bun was soft though, but overall I've definitely had better pork sammies. \u000a\u000aWill I return? Perhaps, when I'm in Town Square or if my friends happen to want to do happy hour here again. I am also interested in the Pre Fixe breakfast on Saturday and Sunday! So maybe I'll have to go back and try that out.

VFirst I trekked out to Anthem to try the original 5 Guys in Vegas a little over a month ago. Today, after I got off work and my tummy was demanding lunch I decided I would give the 5 Guys out in NLV a try. I also heard that this place is teeming with MIUs from Nellis AFB, so that was what really made me make the many mile journey to the North side of town.\u000a\u000aI decided on my first trip to 5 Guys I did not like it better than Inn N Out and this still reigns true. I learned my lesson and ordered the "little burger" this time and slimmed down from getting everything on my burger, to only getting my preferred burger items: lettuce, tomato, cheese, mustard, ketchup. Even though I knew their "regular" fries were going to be ridiculously too much for me to eat - I got them anyway. I still don't like the fries, in fact I REALLY don't like the fries. Maybe I need to try the cajun spice option?\u000a\u000aAs for the place itself, this location seems to be a bit smaller than the one in Anthem. It's still blindingly white, but at least the staff doesn't seem like they're all hopped up on drugs.\u000a\u000aMilitary men nom'ing on burgers and lookin' fine in their BDUs is probably the best thing about this location. Based on that fact alone I'll probably be back.

VStrike number three for Five Guys. No longer in my rotation. Take a seat on the bench. I'm pretty sure I can't come up with anymore baseball euphemisms... but it doesn't matter because I simply do not like these burgers and fries.\u000a\u000aI've wavered about Five Guys and I stayed away for a long time. This afternoon I was in the area and decided, hey I'll try it again. Well I might as well have just gone to Chipotle since my gut was telling me to.\u000a\u000aThis go round I ordered the Cajun fries, which come with a Cajun seasoning. It does have a kick, but to say these are amazing? No way. I was feeling pretty hungry so I went with the "Cheeseburger" (two patties) and I just can't say it's that good. I think it may be the way they wrap the damn thing up so tight. It makes the burger become super soggy super fast. I just feel like I'm eating a mooshed up wanna-be burger. I'm sorry, I feel as though I shouldn't be bashing them this bad, but I'm just so disappointed.\u000a\u000aAnd overall the price just does not reflect these burgers. $11 is too much for a combo meal I don't care how many fries you over-fill my bag with.

VWell, this is how I found Durangos. I put in my GPS that I wanted to go to Qdoba and this is where it took me. I know for a fact that this Durango's used to be a Qdoba because I've eaten there before back when it was a Qdoba. I was really, really disappointed because I had my heart set on a Queso Chicken Burrrito.\u000a\u000aANYWAY, I decided I was already here so I might as well try the place out. I believe it must not have opened very long ago. First off, it's a bit different from your Qdobas and Chipotles. They offer wheat tortillas (for an extra price! Um, I don't think Zaba's charges you extra if you want wheat). And they do have a menu that has salads, tacos, burritos, and enchiladas. They have enchiladas because they have enchilada sauce. They also put the sauce on top of the burritos (wet burritos).\u000a\u000aI ordered the grilled chicken burrito. Here's what is nice: they do grill the chicken meat before they put it into your burrito. Next they offer three types of beans, two types of rice (I got black beans and Spanish rice). Cheese goes inside and on top of your burrito. IF you get the sauce option on top (which I did not) they send your burrito through a heating device so it melts the cheese on top (I'm assuming). I thought my burrito was okay, nothing spectacular and I must admit I like Qdoba and Chipotle better taste-wise.\u000a\u000aPROs: It's different, more options, good if you want to eat a burrito with a fork. They offer a small size (which is HUGE) I can't even imagine what the regular looks like, it must be the size of my head.\u000a\u000aCONs: Not really the best if you want to eat your burrito with your hands. They do not wrap them up in foil. Also, for some reason when I was there, there were ladies in front of me who wanted lettuce inside their burritos (I like mine that way too), but the employees insisted the salad came on the side of the burrito with pico de gallo. Instead of asking they put the lettuce in my burrito I just let them do it how they wanted and ended up mixing the lettuce into my burrito on my own.\u000a\u000aI don't know... I doubt I'd make a return trip. It's far away from where I live. But maybe if they opened one closer to me I would go back to try something different, like their enchiladas.

VI'm not completely sure why this particular shopping area has such a high review. I've been here a handful of times and can honestly say since its conception not much has happened to make it anymore interesting to me than it was before.\u000a\u000aSure, the "market" is a fun romp to look at stuff no one is actually going to buy. Let's see - weird art I will never put in my house, odd doggy boutique, cheese/wine bar I was a bit interested in, but I wasn't hungry, and a speckling of other "trendy/unique" shops I will never spend my money in.\u000a\u000aNext are restaurants, none of which I have been in except for the Cafe Leone, which I actually do like because any beverage I've ordered from there has been perfectly fine.\u000a\u000aThe other stores in here are sparse and honestly boring. And on another note - I can go to other, much more interesting shopping centers and find these exact same stores.\u000a\u000aIn conclusion, no thanks to Tivoli Village, unless I happen to go back to eat cheese and wine someday.

VNo. No.... And no. No to the chicken arepa that is served cold, like a chicken salad full of mayo shoved inside two English muffin-esque buns. I made a very bad choice with that one.\u000a\u000aTried the plain cheese arepa as well. Meh. Seriously, it's English muffins stuffed with things! Sorry. I can't get on the band wagon of Yelpers that love this place.\u000a\u000aRestaurant itself is clean and tidy. Service is great! \u000a\u000aFood is obviously not my cup of tea. My friend had the beef arepa. I wish I had gotten that one... Hummmpphh.\u000a\u000aPrices are kind of high IMO. Maybe I'll try it again. Time will tell.

VClosest buffet to my house and within walking distance if you really wanted to hoof it. It would probably take about half an hour. With that being said I have been to this buffet countless times. My parents love this place and consistently eat here and usually eat for free because they have so many points from gambling at Boulder Station.\u000a\u000aThe prices are on the cheap. CHEAP. You can get breakfast for $5.99. Okay, that's a whole buffet for the price of a combo meal at a lot of places. \u000a\u000aI think it's a decent buffet. Usually they have a very large selection of Mexican foods, even menudo soup sometimes. The "ethnic" (see: Chinese) section usually boasts your typical fair and of course there is pizza and pasta. Meat station usually has turkey and roast beef, although on occasion they do cornish game hens or something else meaty-tastic,\u000a\u000aBest of all is the omelet station. They can make dang good omelets here. Although I usually always go with ham, cheese and jalapeno. However my sister had a spinach omelet and to me it looked pretty tasty!\u000a\u000aAnyway, it's a good buffet. Is the food sometimes sub-par? Yes. But sometimes it's really good. For the cheap price, I think it's worth the gamble.

VThis cute little shop is located in the Meadows Mall. I rarely go to The Meadows, not sure why. But since this place is there now I will probably be going more often.\u000a\u000aIt is a small shop located next to the Macy's on the first floor of the mall. However, it has a charming layout and is very inviting to the eye. The bright colors of the clothing and the fact that it is retro/pinup clothing makes you just want to browse the racks and touch everything.\u000a\u000aThe clothes are very, very cute, but I am into pinup/rockabilly clothes. Not really for normal everyday wear, but when I dress up I really like to get a wiggle dress or a swing dress. Plus I love shoes that look like they're from the 1940s.\u000a\u000aIf you're a person who does a lot of your shopping online looking for 1940s-esque clothes you should try coming down here! I do a lot of my shopping online as well, but at this place you can actually see the clothes and try them on before you purchase.\u000a\u000aThe owner also posts what they get in new every week on Facebook. So you can friend them and then just wait to see what arrives and go down when you see something you want! Very nice store, very cute clothes, I like!

VPopped into this place on a Sunday afternoon with my boyfriend. He loves pizza and I was hungry, and this place is less than a 5 minute drive from his apartment. \u000a\u000aThe service was stellar. I've never heard of this chain of pizza places before, but I'm thinking it's relatively new to the valley. They offer a range of Italian food you'll find at most pizza joints: calzones, pizza, salad bar. My boyfriend and I opted for the deep dish pizza with just cheese. I guess we weren't feeling very adventurous. \u000a\u000aThey brought us out some complimentary breads with cheese melted on top. Nice thought and they were good. Next the pizza came out, we didn't wait very long as there were only two other groups eating. I personally thought the pizza fell somewhat flat. It certainly is not the best pizza I've had and I can think of many other places I'd rather eat. Also, I think I know now I am not the biggest fan of the deep-dish style pizza. Perhaps I need to go try it IN Chicago....\u000a\u000aAnyway, this place is okay. If my boyfriend wants to go again I wouldn't say no, but I think I'd rather try one of their thin pizzas next time.

VEnded up at Aurelio's again for a dinner. The boyfriend wanted pizza and ordered the "AYCE" buffet, which includes their pizzas as well as a salad bar. \u000a\u000aOn the other hand, I did not feel like pizza so after going over their menu, which didn't offer much more than pizza, I decided on a Chicken Parm Sandwich. I opted for the grilled version over the typical breaded chicken parm.\u000a\u000aSandwich - meh. Not great, not bad. They serve up their sandwiches with a huge heaping of bland fries. They also give you an extra container of marinara sauce. My sandwich was dripping in marinara though, so I didn't need it. \u000a\u000aOverall experience - OK. Again, this place is just one of those pizza chains hanging around town.

VMelissa is such a wonderful florist and her bouquets she made for my wedding were amazing! She was very attentive to what I wanted for mine and my girls bouquets. My bouquet was SO BEAUTIFUL! It was just amazing. It had all my colors - green, pink, and yellow.\u000a\u000aShe met me near a Starbucks by my house and she is very flexible with payments. She arrived right on time on the day of my wedding with all the flowers. I didn't have to worry once about them not being there, I knew I wouldn't have to.\u000a\u000aCrazy Daisies is a definite must if you want beautiful, big bouquets for your wedding. Check out the pictures of my flowers!

VOriginally I was going to get Subway for lunch, but once I noted there was a BBQ joint flyer stuck to our front door, my fiance seemed immediately interested in ordering, so we went ahead and jumped on the BBQ delivery boat... \u000a\u000aThe guy on the phone was very pleasant, he even said at the end of the convo, "And I'll see you in 45 minutes!". So I guess that's the same guy who dropped off my food. We ended up ordering their $19.99 combo. 3 meats and 2 sides. We went with the ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. \u000a\u000aDelivery time was perfect, just about 40 minutes when our food arrived. \u000a\u000aAs for the food. Pulled pork and brisket were pretty decent. But the pork seemed overly shredded. It will work well for BBQ pork sandwiches which I plan on making tomorrow for dinner. The brisket pulled apart really well, but the seasonings were not exactly right.. The ribs tips: meh. Fatty, and the parts that were not fatty were kind of like eating jerky. I'll pass on those next time. \u000a\u000aSides. I ordered french fries, which I know is a terrible idea considering they have to be delivered, but I REALLY wanted some starch/carbs because I've been keeping them out of my diet for awhile. They were okay, and had some cajun seasoning on them. Macaroni salad... blah. I think it came out of a can or something. It was bland. Although the noodles were at least not soggy/gross. \u000a\u000aExtra side - I ordered mozzarella sticks because my fiance loves them. They were, um, kind of weird. I'm pretty sure they came out of a box and were just warmed up. Plus - no marinara sauce to dip them in. Womp womp. Lesson learned.\u000a\u000aHonestly I'd probably order from here again just because they deliver BBQ to my house, which is awesome and better than driving to Famous Dave's for super mediocre BBQ.

VI'm going to give an "okay" rating to Spicy Pickle. I would like to give a 4 star rating, but there is one thing holding me back - the price. I realize the food is very fresh and the sandwiches are quite different from other sandwich chains, but still... I think their pricing may be due to the fact they also make the personal pizzas, and they do paninis as well. I can imagine that's kind of costly to a place that is this small. \u000a\u000aI have had Spicy Pickle before I went to this new one in Vegas which is located off of Warm Springs. They opened a Spicy Pickle in Reno when I lived there many moons ago. I remember going a few times and thinking it was pretty good.\u000a\u000aOn my visit I had the Santa Cruz sandwich ($7.95). And all sandwiches come with a selection of a side: fruit or macaroni salad, or you can upgrade to an actual salad as well, but its costs extra. I opted for the macaroni salad, because I've had it in the past and it is actually very good. It never comes out slimy or gross, but is actually light and tasty, considering it's macaroni. My Santa Cruz was very well put together. The lettuce was crisp, the bread had a nice feel to it, and the other toppings/meat were plentiful, yet not over-bearing. I hate it when I get a sandwich that is busting at the seams, just not my thing. My meal also came with spicy pickle (how appropriate...)\u000a\u000aComparable to... Capprioti's in my opinion, but SP has a lot more selection. The prices are comparable, but SP has a completely different vision from Cap's. You might also compare it to Quizno's, but then again SP is much higher-ranking than Quiznos taste-wise and freshness wise. \u000a\u000aThere's a lot of selection here. That's their strong point. If you're looking for something different that you've never had before in the sandwich world, SP would be for you. \u000a\u000aSpicy Pickle, if you were priced just a *bit* lower I would frequent more often.

VI ventured to Del Mar Cafe with my family on Father's Day. We arrived and the place was in full swing. I could tell they were definitely getting a lot of business. There were a lot plates on the counter-top area that had not been cleaned off, and they stayed there while my family waited for our table. \u000a\u000aSomehow we must have walked in at the right time because the next few groups who came in were told the wait for a table would be 20-30 minutes. I can understand why; Del Mar Cafe makes everything on their menu to order. So don't come here expecting the quickest service and it will be all good. Especially when it is busy.\u000a\u000aAs for food - I had 2 pancakes, 3 over easy eggs, and 2 sausage patties. I was very tempted to order something from their Espresso Bar, but went with just a Coke. Maybe next time. My father raved over his Eggs Benedict, which came on a bed of spinach and tomatoes. He also opted for an extra side of Canadian bacon. I kind of wish I'd gotten his dish! My mother got the same thing as me, but got a big fluffy waffle instead of pancakes. My brother decided to eat lunch, since we were there around Noon. He got the chicken wrap (minus the avocado) and he said it was great. The portion was HUGE! \u000a\u000aOverall the food is a definite 5 Star. However, the service was a bit spotty. I was never asked if I wanted my Coke refilled. I sipped it slowly throughout my meal, because somehow I just knew I wouldn't get a refill - and my premonition came true. It wasn't until our waitress came to take away my plate that she asked if I wanted a refill, to which I refused, because I was at the end of my meal anyway. My mother and father got refills on their iced tea and coffee... so why not refill the sodas my brother and I had? *shrug* I have no idea.\u000a\u000aI will come back to try their lunch I think AND the Espresso Bar. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for made-from-scratch, made-to-order food.

VThe bar itself is visually pleasing. The old bookcase theme is clever. The random chairs and black/white floor sets off a hipster vibe like no other. The bar serves food and boasts a "No Smoking" policy, which I am totally down with.\u000a\u000aDrinks though, as others have noted, are pricey. These are prices I would expect to pay on the strip, not in some random lofts next to a beauty salon downtown. Downtown is known for having these great bars with great drinks prices - so that is where Lady Sylvia is lacking. \u000a\u000aWhile there during happy hour ($6 wines/$3 beers/lower well drink prices) my friends and I partook of their wine. I happened to have the Rock N Roll Wine which they are offering at $3 a glass during the month of August. My friends had wine as well. I decided, what the hell, I'll try one of the cocktails (the $12 ones, NOT the $14 ones, are you freaking kidding me? I can get better mixed drinks than these at Comme Ca during their happy hour for LESS!). I had the 18b, a very nice concoction featuring blueberry vodka. I will admit, Kenny, the bartender, knows how to mix it up well. \u000a\u000aThe food - while we were there they were serving up tapas (called something else with a "p", but basically - tapas). They basically placed them all on a side of the bar and it was buffet style. Go up, get what you want and then tell the bartender what you had. Honesty policy pretty much. I had two tapas - don't remember their names, but they were pretty good. But they were all served on slices of thick, toasted bread. I like that they serve food - I just don't like the way they do it. None of the tapas were noted as to what they actually were. I picked up something I thought was seafood, but when I bit into it, it was definitely potatoes. The food is yes, a great idea, I think they just need to work on how they DO IT. \u000a\u000aLast but not least a few minor flaws - the gaming machines on the bar - why? While I was there not one person was gaming, not one. Young, hipster Las Vegans do not go Downtown to gamble. Lose the machines and the bar would be much better. And lastly - while my friends and I were there a couple came in the bar and brought in two dogs. The woman actually sat at the bar and held the dog in her lap. I mean, it was a serious WTF moment for me. Who brings dogs into a bar? What kind of bar (especially one that serves food) allows people to bring in their dogs? And no, these dogs were not seeing-eye dogs. THAT is one of the reasons I dropped this place a whole star. Without the dog fiasco it probably would have been 4.\u000a\u000aSo - visually pleasing, decent drinks (yet, again, pricey) a good bartender - in all honesty, had a decent time. Would I go back? Probably during happy hour. Would I be back on say, a Saturday night? Nah. I'll go to Vanguard and Downtown Cocktail Lounge for that.

VI'm sorry, I just cannot get into many Asian foods, Japanese included. I rarely, very, very rarely eat Chinese, Thai, Japanese, etc. With the exception of sushi. I don't know, call me a white-bread-eatin' American? The thing is I am excited to try new culinary cuisines, but Asian-inspired dishes just are not my cup of tea for some reason. The spices, the tastes... they just don't hit my palette like Italian and Mexican dishes do.\u000a\u000aWith that being said I think Cafe de Japon is A-OK. It would probably be bumped to 4 stars if I truly enjoyed Japanese food. On my trip here I had the Pre-Fixe lunch menu. It came with a small salad - very good and fresh. Next was the agedashi tofu appetizer, which I thought was okay. I'm not a huge tofu fan, and even this hearty dish failed to get me super excited about it. For my main course I had the tororin omelet with rice. It was hearty and rich, plus the ketchup gave it a taste as though it had been cooked in a kitchen at a home. \u000a\u000aLastly I had the siphon coffee, which was FABULOUS. I would come back for the coffee, but probably not anything else. \u000a\u000aOverall I think those who really love Japanese food will love Cafe de Japon, but for me I will probably stick to doing a full-out meal elsewhere.

VAs far as Starbucks goes this one is spot-on. It is the closest Starbucks to my house and therefore receives a lot of my business. I'm a regular and I know many of the baristas as I frequently stop here or drive-thru to get my java on.\u000a\u000aAlthough the strip mall in which it is located is very scuzzy this Starbucks is still nice. There is a bit of seating inside as well as out. \u000a\u000aBest of all there's a drive-thru which is oh-so-convenient when I just don't feel like going in.\u000a\u000aThe employees are nice and always greet you. Even if they're busy with the drive-thru menu they will make sure you know they've recognized you're there waiting to order. \u000a\u000aA good Starbucks here. No problemos. Muy bueno.

VGluten free. Bakery. Cute. Clean. Friendly.\u000a\u000aI stopped here with a friend today to check out this bakery. It happens to be on a side of town I do not frequent very often so the likelihood I would come back here is slim to none. That aside, the bakery offers lovely looking breads, cupcakes, brownies, cookies, and other sweet delights.\u000a\u000aI have no reason to eat gluten free, but I enjoyed the brownie I purchased. It was thick, sweet, chocolaty, and had a nice dense texture. However, at $4+ I doubt I would indulge in such a pricey treat too often. ;)

VI'm going to echo the same sentiments of Jessie B. I really, really did want to love Bread and Butter. Alas, I am not in love. And alas, it just was not so great I would be willing to make the drive across town specifically to come here again.\u000a\u000aYes, it is a cute storefront, everything about the place screams it was made with love down to the last detail of the bright, shining, silver (but plastic) coffee spoons. \u000a\u000aOn a morning I had to turn my car over to VW for an oil change I decided this would be a great spot to grab breakfast with my Mom. We ordered the breakfast egg pizza and the breakfast burrito. As always my mother and I wished we had just ordered one entree and split it. If you're not super hungry or you're just not a big eater, I would suggest splitting those entrees. They're big. Taste wise? The pizza was delish, although it had a bit too much Parmesan on it for me. I was wiping it off. However, the cheese, the eggs and I also got bacon (costs extra) were all great, as was the pizza dough (better be, right?). Breakfast burrito? Great flavors. However, the burrito came with a salad which had a funny (in a bad way) texture. It was as if the lettuce was wilted and possibly going bad. Not a good combo with salad.\u000a\u000aAnd to be noted, the service wasn't exceptional. We were not offered refreshers for our coffees until we asked for a to-go bag. My mother's burrito came out before my pizza, which wouldn't be a big deal, but I waited a good 5 minutes for my pizza. It doesn't seem like a long time, but when one person at the table has their meal and the other doesn't - it seems like an eternity. The wait for the food was not on par for how many people were in the restaurant. We were one of three groups and the wait was strangely long.\u000a\u000aIt's a good place, don't get me wrong. However, it is new. I think it needs some work. Maybe I'll be back just to try some breads or some of their confectioneries. The root beer selection is rockin' as well. My mom got my dad a sarsaparilla soda (hard to come by these days). But, for the price and the wait and the quality, it warrants only an "okay" from me for now.

V2 times and both times were okay experiences. My first visit was right after BnB opened. My now second visit has come many months after their opening. Strangely, I still think they are trying to get the kinks worked out at this place. You would think for how popular the place is most of the problems would be fixed. That, or the days I have been here have been their "off days". \u000a\u000aI went here for a lunch with 2 friends and the place was packed. I had to scour the crowd for people who looked like they were leaving. Once two women got up from their table outside I immediately snagged it before it was even cleaned up. When my friend I arrived I went inside to place my order.\u000a\u000aI decided on the pesto chicken flatbread and was rebuffed - gah! Their flatbread griller thingamajig was not working, out of commission for the day. Saddened I tried to decide what my choice B would be... but alas, the lady behind the cash register came to my rescue! They would make my pesto chicken as a sandwich. Fantastico!\u000a\u000aAs my friends and I chatted we waited for food, which eventually came. Hmm. Considering I put MY order in waaaay before my friends (about 10 mins) I found it odd that my plate came out AFTER theirs. \u000a\u000aThe sandwich itself was good. The soft bread was the main star. I guess they do breads well here. That's a good thing. The rest of the sandwich was pretty meh. \u000a\u000aI meant to go in and get a chocolate tart because I have heard they are amazeballs, but I forgot to go back in once my group was seated outside chatting for awhile. I think I'll be back for that tart...

VExcuse me, can I have a Kleenex, cuz this Thai food is so amazing it's making my nose run.\u000a\u000aThat's how I love my Thai food. SPI-saaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!\u000a\u000aI have heard the rumblings of Le Thai and I just had to check it out tonight. I am writing this after eating the food (at home because you can get it to-go) AND having a lovely cocktail at their bar.\u000a\u000aFirst off, I had the "Lady Boy Cocktail" concocted with what I have now discovered is a mehkong whiskey from Thailand. Um, why haven't I heard of this before? As a lover of whiskey this drink lifted me off my seatt and floated me into whiskey la-la land. It was sweet. But not too sweet. Yet, it gave me that delicious feeling only whiskey can provide.\u000a\u000aSecond - food! I ordered the Curry with beef at a heat level of three. I always like to "test the waters" at new Thai places. Which means I go for the middle of the heat level. This level, for me, was ALMOST perfect. Next time I'll probably go for a 4. But that's just me.\u000a\u000aOh and by the way I got the chicken wings too. OH MAH GOD. How good were they? Not greasy. Perfectly cooked. Not too small, not too big. Oh and the sauce? PERFECT!\u000a\u000aGet your butt to Le Thai pronto.

VAgain, Le Thai did not disappoint me. This will be my second 5 Star review of this establishment which has now become a favorite of mine in the Downtown area and I adore downtown. \u000a\u000aI love the atmosphere here and I certainly enjoy sitting at the bar to drink and dine. I ended up here with a friend after happy hour at Vanguard. I told her about the wonderful Lady Boy cocktail and that she had to try it. We ended up both having two while we dined! It is just an amazingly good drink.\u000a\u000aThis go round I had the Pad Thai at a spicy level of 3. It was a generous portion served in a lovely clean, white bowl. Of course, I gobbled it down quickly, although slowing towards the end because my mouth was afire! But seriously, it was good pad thai. I have come to a conclusion that they do not snub spiciness here. If you are a spicy fan than you gotta eat here.

VMy experience had some technical difficulties. Plus... I really wasn't that scared. \u000a\u000aHere we go, Freakling Brothers. I was really looking forward to this. I went last night with a friend and my brother. We sprung for the $30 pass to get us into all of the houses. Well, we had driven this far, why not? First they force you into a group photo on a green screen so they can try to hawk you pictures at the end of your night. You also get pics taken IF you go through Gates of Hell. Not any of the other houses. \u000a\u000aWe started at the "Circus" themed house. All right, the actors do it right. You get all the "rules" told to you by the actors before you go in. They're fun. We tried to make them give us crap and they were willing to oblige. I don't remember a whole lot about the Circus one except for the ball pit. THAT was interesting, never seen that before. At the end we ended up waiting and waiting for them to let us out. Then a stage-hand type person with a flashlight told us one of the actors got hurt and he had to escort us out. AT LEAST they offered to let everyone who got to that point go through again free of charge. We decided not to because we wanted to get to the other houses before they closed.\u000a\u000aOff we went to the Vampire themed house. We waited in line for, I kid you not, 30 minutes to get into this house. Now, here's my issue and something I think they should do to fix the wait time. Ask people how many are in their party, if it's just two, try to send those people with two (or three) other people. It's okay to go through a haunted house with strangers. Come on, everyone becomes friends when you're getting scared in the dark anyway. So, that's my one big ding is that they kept sending two people through at a time if that's how many were in their group. ANYWAY - the Vampire one was O.K. not really my favorite. The end was not spectacular... moving on.\u000a\u000aGates of Hell - you have to sign a waiver, you have to understand foul language will be used, you have to realize you will get shoved/touched/pushed/etc. by the actors. OK. Got it. We signed and waited. Finally our turn arrived. I don't want to give too much away since there are many out there who will want to be scared to begin with, but I will divulge a bit. First off, myself and my friend did NOT think this was that bad. Sure, they shoved us. Yes, my brother got pulled and flung up into a wall at one point (not hard). We all got shocked (yep, you WILL get shocked no matter what), and I was the lucky person to be trapped against the wall by the girl who has been licking people (ya, read the reviews, you'll see what I mean). \u000a\u000aLUCKILY I had read the reviews and knew what was coming. I ASSUMED I would be the person in our party the girl would pick (she did). When she pushed me against the wall I put my hands over my face and looked directly at the wall. She said some stuff to me (honestly I don't remember because I was trying not to laugh). Here's the thing - it *maybe* would have freaked me out a bit had I not known it was coming, but I did. BUT, even then I would have prepared myself for something like this anyway. I don't think it would have scared me, or bothered me, BUT if she had LICKED me, well I probably wouldn't have been too happy. She did not lick me (but that may have been because I covered my face).\u000a\u000aOverall Gates of Hell - The best of the houses. So, if you come here and you only want to do one house, do the Gates of Hell. You might as well as the other houses are tame. Even Gates of Hell wasn't that bad (at least for me). BUT, I'm not scared super easily, plus I know for fact these people can't *really* do anything to hurt me. But remember - they offer the safe word for that purpose. If you get scared, too scared, just yell it out. It's that easy.\u000a\u000aI hope next year they can take it even further. I'd be willing to go back in that case.

VDo you live on the West side of town? Are you looking for a no-frills joint for breakfast or lunch? Norm's just may be your place.\u000a\u000aThis restaurant specializes in breakfast items ranging from omelettes to pancakes. Lunch items include HUGE salads, sandwiches, and some specials for $5.99. Dang, you won't break the bank! \u000a\u000aI have had - The Cobb Salad - large and in charge. Comes with hardboiled egg, chicken, bacon, ham, feta cheese, and your choice of dressing. Although the salad is large and filling I was missing the green. The salad was made up primarily of iceberg lettuce. Meh.\u000a\u000aCurry Chicken Lunch Special - I'm not sure what possessed me to order this, but to put it bluntly: it was not good. The sauce was like gravy, the chicken had a been-frozen-flavor, and the rice was not cooked very well. Just steer clear of this one.\u000a\u000aService is great. Prices are great. It's a decent spot, it's A-OK. Nothing wrong here, nothing really bad, but nothing really great either.

VIf I was rating based off the one cocktail I had here I would add another star, but we must take all things into account.\u000a\u000aFirst impressions of the Mob Bar, are that I wish it was a bit more "mob" and a bit less "same old Vegas bar". Don't get me wrong, the ambiance is not terrible, but I was thinking speak easy and got more - uh, bar? There is seating for lounging and then here is the bar itself. What I *really* dislike is the inclusion of video poker machines on the bar area. I think its tacky. I think its unnecessary for a bar Downtown. \u000a\u000aLet's move on to the drinks. The drink menu is decent and what would bring me back for more. There are obvious classics and other cocktails with flourishes of new age ingredients and mixologies. I had the Bogart, the concoction of which, I cannot remember. What I do remember is that it was STRONG.\u000a\u000aOverall I would return because of the cocktail menu. They also serve food which comes from the adjoining Triple George Grill.

VI've now been to Parsley twice. I held off on doing a review after the first visit because I used a Restaurant.com coupon the first time I went. I wanted to go again to get the full on effect of paying full price and comparing the quality of food. Food always tends to be awesome when you're getting it for a lower price, so I definitely wanted to balance the two experiences. \u000a\u000aI was going to go full on 5 Stars after my first experience. The great reviews about this place are actually very accurate and I do not think the 5 stars are not warranted. But also of note, this is not really totally authentic Mediterranean food, but kind of a "fast" take on Mediterranean food. Since it is what it is, that is how I will grade it. With that being said, on to the food.\u000a\u000aFirst time I went I opted for the baguette option instead of a wrap. I purchased two - a steak shwarma and a chicken shwarma. The chicken was for my husband, the steak for myself. I ordered the large, because hey, why not? I was using a coupon anyway. The quantity of meat/extras you get is very good, and it is good quality. Personally I liked the chicken better than the steak. These two shwarmas made four meals. One for my husband, and three for me! I also ordered the French fries (pretty good, nothing spectacular), and two cupcakes. Oh Em Gee were they good. The frosting was fluffy and the cake was perfect. Couldn't believe I got such amazing cupcakes at a Mediterranean place! Definitely grab one if you're in the mood for dessert, you won't regret it!\u000a\u000aNext experience - today I went for lunch, to pick up something to take home for myself. I decided to go for a wrap steak shwarma, large. I figured I'd eat half and have the rest tomorrow for lunch. For me this go round I felt as though the steak was lacking something, I just can't place my finger on it. It had an almost bitter taste I couldn't get over as I ate it. I also disliked the wrap option, I should have gotten the baguette option again. I'm just not a fan of tortillas unless they're in burrito form I guess. Plus the white flour tortilla I got was very dusty of flour and it got all over my hands. Meh.\u000a\u000aOverall I would return to Parsley, especially since it isn't *too* far from my home. Next time I think I'd like to try a plate of shwarma instead of a wrap. This is a good spot for good food. Employees are nice, if maybe a bit brisk with customers during their peak times. Try out Parsley for sure, it's a good bet for shwarma at a decent price in a nice location.

VShort and sweet - because it's a Subway.\u000a\u000aFood - well put together sandwich, just the way I like it. They asked me if I wanted it toasted, I said yes, and it was indeed, toasted. Extra point!\u000a\u000aThe Place - Clean-cut looking establishment. Chairs, tables, etc. all taken care of and clean.\u000a\u000aBathroom - Clean.\u000a\u000aService - Perfect. Two youngish teenager looking boys helped me. They greeted me, they made my sandwich, they said goodbye. \u000a\u000aOverall - 5 Stars. One of the better Subways I've been to in the valley.

VI just joined a gym! With all the gluttonous eating I do, it's probably a good thing. Oh and all the baking and the cooking and the general love of food....\u000a\u000aAnyway, my boyfriend and I noticed this Plant Fitness was opening up last month and we decided to see what it was all about. Unfortunately last month they were still under construction so we could not actually see the inside of the gym. We decided not to join based on the fact we couldn't actually take a tour of the facility. This was unfortunate because they were doing an amazing deal $1 start-up fee and $10 a month. $10 a month!! That's crazy cheap for a gym. Anyway, my boyfriend just so happened to see that this month they had extended the deal! We went in yesterday and signed right up.\u000a\u000aThe gym is welcome to all types of people. I get the feeling it is more of a family oriented place. It's not for grunters or body-builders. The majority of the gym is for cardio with body-building and ab workout equipment dispersed around the outside. There is also a 30-minute workout center which you can do when you gotta make a quick trip to the gym.\u000a\u000aI really like their mottos they have here. One sign said "We're here to kiss your butt, not kick it... unless that's what you want!" I love it! This is because I honestly HATE HATE HATE going to the gym and exercising. I will admit it! I really do not enjoy it. BUT I know I have to do something to stay active and keep the pounds off. It's a trade off I guess. I eat like a Roman elite and then I have to go work it off. \u000a\u000aI hope Planet Fitness stays this way, because I have a feeling it will be a very good gym for me and my boyfriend.

VNot bad, not great. Would I eat here again? When the need for a gyro or chicken souvlaki hits me... perhaps, if I'm in the area. \u000a\u000aIt's a chain, as I used to have Pita Pit in college when I attended the University of Nevada in Reno, I know this to be true. I remember being highly addicted to the pitas here based off the fact I could get so many add-ins for no additional money. I could basically stuff my pita so full of romaine lettuce, spinach, banana peppers, mushrooms, cucumbers, and all kinds of tasty sauces I wouldn't have to eat for a whole day because I'd be so full. And that was kind of the point - as a poor college student, paying almost $10 for a combo meal at Pita Pit was like... half my beer budget for happy hour at the bar down the street. \u000a\u000aAs an adult (heh heh) now, and not a college student, Pita Pit is all right. Even with all the stuffing of veggies I can fit into one of these bad boys it's still just all right. By no means was my chicken souvlaki pita bad, it was good, but I've definitely had better Greek food elsewhere. But again, this is Pita Pit, the chain that also serves a Dagwood pita - so can I really base my opinion off of it while comparing it to actual Greek places that specialize in *Greek* only dishes? \u000a\u000aOverall - service was extremely friendly and the guys working here were absolutely fabulous. They accepted my LivingSocial deal quickly and with ease. They were also chatty while making my pita and making me feel welcome. Food - somewhat bland, but it's a chain, so I guess my comparison to more authentic Greek places is somewhat moot. Therefore, Pita Pit is A-OK in my book. Check them out if you're in the UNLV area, at least you will feel good stuffing your pita with lots of good greens and veggies in the end!

VOrganized crime, the mob, Mayor Oscar Goodman, all of these things conjure up in my head when I think about my trip the The Mob Museum, plus it was a fun experience, and yes, educational as well!\u000a\u000aI like the interactive aspects of the museum, and although I did not read everything on all the walls, I appreciate how much effort went into the informative side of the museum. The fact that there are many ways to interact and learn about the subject matter is a refreshing new twist on a way to visit a museum.\u000a\u000aYou could spend HOURS in the museum if you really wanted to. There are 3 floors, so don't look at the building and think "that's too small for a museum!". They really have taken the space and made it into something special, while still keeping the historic court room (which is why this building is registered). \u000a\u000aFor $10 for locals this is a complete bargain for something fun to do when you're bored. Even tourists will love The Mob Museum, I think the entry fee for them is $18. I think that too it a pretty decent price for being able to leisurely walk through a museum with such fun subject matter.\u000a\u000aThe one thing that rubbed me the wrong way is the payment/check-in process. If you pay with a card you get 2 receipts, a wrist band, AND a ticket. I stopped to shove all my stuff in my purse, except the wrist band, took the time to put it on (myself) and then as I approached the woman who would let us into the museum she requested my actual ticket, which had been shoved into the depths of my purse! So, I had to rummage around for it. Pick one or the other Mob Museum - ticket or wristband. Too many of these things makes the process of getting in annoying.

VIt was St. Patrick's Day and it was cold and wet on Downtown Fremont Street. Hennessy's was bursting at the seams and it reeked of frat boys and stale green beer (already at 6 PM). There was nothing my group and I could do, except eat Italian on the most Irish day of the year!\u000a\u000aOkay, so that's a little dramatic. But for St. Patty's Day my friend, myself, and my fiance found ourselves at Luna Rossa, which is a cute, new Italian food joint on Fremont Street. It has a very open seating area, and a bar, which is where we sat. Behind the bar you can see the open stove/oven where they cook their pizzas.\u000a\u000aWe ordered drinks and decided on splitting one of their large 12" pizzas. Because my fiance is not as "out there" with his food choices, we kept it simple with the prosciutto pizza and an order of bruschetta to start with. The bruschetta had a nice tomatoey flavor, and I felt as though it was decent enough. The bread had a slight crunch, but not so much that I felt as though my teeth were going to fall out trying to eat it (I've had bruschetta like that before.. yuck). The pizza was a nice, thin crust. It was baked just right, not a piece of it was soggy, the crust had a slight burn, but not charred. I think it could have had a *bit* more sauce, but that could be just my personal preference. The prosciutto had a nice salty flavor and my fiance loved it! He has now found a new favorite food. The only thing is, the prosciutto pretty much comes entirely off the pizza once you take a bite of it, so it's hard to get a little prosciutto with every bite.\u000a\u000aI would certainly recommend checking this place out if you need some food downtown. For the pizza, app, and 5 drinks our total came to $54. Honestly that aint bad for three people to have dinner and drinks!

VI will start off with what is good about Luna Rossa, since this is an update, I have been here on 3 occasions, all with different outcomes. The first time here I ate at the bar and it was a good experience. The second time, I ordered pizza from the take out window. While a bit pricey - still good. Lastly, I came here for dinner with friends on a Thursday night. Now, not my number one choice to dine on Fremont Street, but I relented to my friends who wanted to go.\u000a\u000aFirst of all this is what Luna Rossa is - an Italian restaurant serving mainly pizza (out of a window, no less), that is attempting (and failing) to be an "upscale" (HAR HAR) restaurant on Fremont Street. Their menu reflects this, especially the dinner menu. Not one item on their dinner menu is under $10. I'm no cheapskate, but the menu itself falls incredibly flat. Appetizers that they didn't have. Pizzas that with so many toppings the thin crust becomes soggy in the middle (yeck!), and overpriced entrees!  I am not paying over $10 for spaghetti and meatballs unless I am sitting in a nicer looking dining room in a place where people aren't zip lining outside, okay? AND people better be dressed nicer, because obvi this place doesn't have a dress code.\u000a\u000aThe place itself looks like an eatery - not a fine dining establishment. There is PAPER on the tables for God's sake. My friends and I had the following -\u000a\u000aSalmon Dinner Entree - One friend didn't want pizza so she got the salmon, said it was pretty good. BUT because me and my other friend ordered pizza - she did not get any complimentary bread. Yes, Luna Rossa will refuse you bread service if someone in your party orders pizza. RI-DIC-U-LOUS. It says so right in their menu.\u000a\u000aArtichokes, Olives, Proscuitto, Peppers Pizza - I don't remember the real name, but I remember what was on it, because  with all of those toppings the thin crust became soggy very quickly. It was like eating moosh pizza in the middle especially.\u000a\u000aHere's the kicker - Luna Rossa charges you an 18% gratuity - NO MATTER WHAT. You had bad service? Too bad, you've already been charged. There's only three of you eating? Too bad, you've already been charged.\u000a\u000aWhat is this shady business? (OK - they have it printed in the menu, but that doesn't make it any less BS.) Even if our service had been outstanding, which it wasn't, it was just basically good service - I wouldn't have tipped MORE after the restaurant has the audacity to force a required tip on me. I think they're probably doing it because of their location. Perhaps they have a lot of tourists who don't bother tipping? I don't know, I don't care. But I do know one thing - I will not be back here, and I will certainly tell my other local friends who hang out downtown to steer clear of this place as well.

VCan I say how many times I've been to this A&W/Long John Silvers? I'm not sure, because it's too many times to count. This happens to a be a favorite hit-up spot of my boyfriend's. He really loves this place and I'm not entirely sure why. Now that we've moved from his side of town to mine, we've been going to one a little closer, but we were over on the North side of town last night and of course, he wanted to eat here.\u000a\u000aOkay, it's not terrible, because it's fast food and all fast food is kind of terrible, right? I'd rather eat at McDonald's... or Burger King, or definitely Inn N Out or Sonic. That's a lot of places I'd rather eat at. \u000a\u000aOf course this is a combo restaurant. I believe A&W teamed up with LJS because their business had been failing (surprise!). I LOVE A&W Root Beer and Root Beer Floats, which is probably the only reason I'd ever come here before meeting my boyfriend, I had never had the food. The food is so mediocre, it's sad. The burgers are tiny, and sometimes they remind me of lunch-time at my elementary school. The fries are absolutely nothing special. As for the LJS side, I can say I only like Hush Puppies. Other than that the thought of their too-much-breaded fish and its greasiness make me run for the hills. \u000a\u000aI want to say it is okay because it is an American "classic", but I feel as though A&Ws will soon be gone from our landscape. Oh, as a side note, they do serve deep-fried cheese curds. Probably one of the only fast food joints that do.

VI've been to Ellis Island a handful of times I can count. Recently I decided perhaps I would try their much raved about cheap and yummy breakfast served at their cafe with my sister in tow. She was staying at The Signature at MGM so Ellis Island was very close by.\u000a\u000aWhen we arrived the cafe was busy. Not busy enough for us to not be seated quickly though. Our waitress came by and we were ready to order. There's not much to the breakfast menu, so you don't have a lot to mull over. I ordered the Denver omelet and my sister ordered the french toast with bacon. The prices are quite cheap, but not dirt cheap.\u000a\u000aThe wait wasn't long. Our food arrived rather quickly considering how many people there were in the place. My food was placed in front of me and I knew then why the food was that quick. I realize a Denver omelet isn't a gourmet meal, but mine looked meh. The green peppers were diced very small. The ham looked as though it had definitely come packaged and sliced into small bits. It tasted meh and it was a bit hard for my tastes. It certainly wasn't a nice, fluffy, soft omelet. The potatoes on the side were overcooked, but okay - nothing special. \u000a\u000aMy sister didn't feel good by the time our food came out, so she didn't eat her french toast. I'm not sure if it was good or not. Since we had to retreat quickly since she wasn't feeling well I was able to flag down the server quickly and get our reciept. I think she sensed our urgency and was quick about it, so at least that was nice of her. \u000a\u000aThe service, to me, was better than the food. Maybe I'll just stick to karaoke here and the beer and Metro Pizza every once and awhile.

VOh IHOP, as far as breakfast places go, you are a staple, aren't you?\u000a\u000aI've been to this IHOP on numerous occasions with my fiance. He likes IHOP, I go with him to IHOP. I used to frequent this place when I was in high school with my friends.\u000a\u000aOverall it's just your normal, run of the mill pancake house. Often they have random promotions going on for whatever new kid-flick may be out at the time. The servers get issued garments to wear, blasting the movie in your face, as does their "new menu items"!\u000a\u000aI usually go with pancakes or an omelet. Every once and awhile I may order off the dinner menu, but not too often. Their breakfast items are staples and they tend to do them right. Just keep in mind the huge-ass portions you're getting. I tend not to eat my entire meal.\u000a\u000aThis particular IHOP is in the GHETT-O! Because it is the closest to my house is the only reason we come here. The service is usually spot-on and the servers are nice. I've experience better IHOP's though. And I've experienced MUCH better places to eat breakfast.

VMy husband and I walked this trail with our dogs on an early Saturday morning. The trail is paved and runs along the power lines waaaay out Southeast. You can walk/bike on this trail. I think it is made more for biking than walking. A lot of people were biking there the morning my husband and I were walking our dogs.\u000a\u000aIf you do the entire trail it is 30+ miles. The first 4-5 miles is kind of boring because you are simply walking a straight path. The only nice thing is you get really picturesque views of the entire Las Vegas Valley. Once you get about 4 miles in the trail veers to the right and I am assuming at some point you would be able to see Lake Las Vegas to your left if you kept going.\u000a\u000aMy husband and I turned around at the 4-mile mark and walked back. Our dogs were tired. So were we.\u000a\u000aI would also suggest starting this trail at a different point to get a better hike out of it. I think next time my husband and I will try to start it from an area by Lake Mead. Perhaps my rating will go up then, we will see.

VHabor Freight Tools is an alternative to the "big-box" stores such as Home Depot and Lowes. The store itself is much smaller and I would compare it to Ace's Hardware. However, Harbor Freight is missing the large lawn care section that Ace's has.\u000a\u000aIf you are in need of a tool, they probably have it here. Prices are apparently quite low according to my husband who noted several tools here were less pricey than HD or Lowes. However, he did question the quality. I guess we can't really know since he ended up not buying anything, mainly because what we came here for, they did not have (welding goggles). \u000a\u000aI think the store is much less intimidating than HD or Lowes since it is much smaller and easier to navigate. Obviously the store does not have as much of a selection, and no gardening center either.\u000a\u000aFor what it is, it is A-OK.

VMaybe not the best farmer's market in Vegas. I'm still kinda convinced the one that used to be held in the warehouse behind Industrial was the best. Unfortunately that is no longer... and I think the one at Spring's Preserves offers more space than Downtown 3rd. \u000a\u000aBut - I am indeed a fan of this farmer's market. I especially love that it is Downtown, a place I love to frequent, and which I am glad is getting more traffic and more business. \u000a\u000aLike I said, there's not a whole lot of space, but what space they have is well used. Here at the market you can find varying fruits and veggies. Veggies you've never had, peppers that are nice and spicy from Alamo, Nevada. Oh - so good! Supporting local farmers! \u000a\u000aThere are also some shops set up selling natural, organic-type foods and often you will find a food truck or two here outside making tasties!\u000a\u000aOh man, please check out the guy selling hummus for all that is heavenly! Hummus of amazingness I am telling you.\u000a\u000aOverall - check it out. Get some veggies. Support local farmers. Support local food trucks! Just support this market please, I don't want it to go away.

VGolden Corral has graced Las Vegas with its mediocre buffet in a city that is known for every casino, on just about every block, that has.... a buffet.\u000a\u000aMy husband and I decided to throw in the towel and try this place out. After months of seeing the parking lot full to the brim and lines out the door, we saw it wasn't TOO busy on a Saturday afternoon.\u000a\u000aFirst impressions: You get your beverage before you pay, you are herded into the establishment like cattle, and lo and behold... you enter complete and utter MADNESS.\u000a\u000aPros - Selection is decent. Desserts are plentiful\u000a\u000aCons - Food is mediocre, the place is too small, and it is a mad-house. \u000a\u000aApparently the Golden Corral does not do a good job telling its guests to corral their CHILDREN. Although there are signs posted that say, "Children must be accompanied by adults at all times.", this suggestion is thrown out the window. Children run rampant in here without parental supervision, knocking into people, plowing their way into buffet lines. The adults here aren't any better. There's no rhyme or reason to how people get their food, there's no lines to speak of. It's an all-out brawl fest -- almost.\u000a\u000aCleanliness is an issue. My husband and I searched for a table and could not find a decently cleaned one, we had to wipe one down and remove dirty napkins just so we could have a place to eat. We also watched as a family with two small infants allows these children to sloppily plow through food and fling said food all over the floor - it was gross.\u000a\u000aOverall - never again.

VKISS + Mini Golf = Good times.\u000a\u000aLet's get real, there aren't very many places to mini golf in Vegas. Why? I have no idea. Basically all you have are two options - King Putt or the "putting range" as I like to refer to it that really isn't all that fun because there's no cool props, etc. \u000a\u000aThen comes KISS Mini Golf. Vegas has been in serious need of a cool place since Scandia went down the drain. What happened to Scandia?! That place was cool. KISS Mini Golf doesn't come close to Scandia, but hey, at least it's SOMETHING.\u000a\u000aFirst off you are greeted by black lights, loud music, and KISS memorabilia all over the place. In order to get to the actual mini golf part, you make your way through arcade games. The Vegas themed black-light artwork on the walls is awesome and great for pictures - especially since the staff encourages you to take pics. \u000a\u000aAs for the holes - they're okay. There are some that are a bit tricky, but not too bad. If you have kids this is a pretty cool course for them to swing away at. But it's good for adults too. \u000a\u000aThe staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. They ask where you're from and they seem to really enjoy it if you say you're a local. Plus - you get a discount! \u000a\u000aI'd go back for sure when the urge for the putt putt hits me.

VThis Starbucks is the closest one to my work so it's super convenient. Of course, the drive-thru is perfect for me since I'm usually running down here to get a drink on my down-time or my lunch break.\u000a\u000aBeen inside as well and the place is typically clean, not super busy. The manager has left his business card out on the area where there are creamers/sugars, so props to that person for being up-front to your customers.\u000a\u000aAlso, my car once stalled in the drive-thru here and the barista working the window was kind enough to actually come out and push my car into the parking lot. Of course, I guess he was kind of obligated to since my car would be impeding the drive-thru had he not. But, very nice individual working there for sure.\u000a\u000aOverall, no complaints and I've never received a weird/funky drink here either, so definitely 5 Stars.

VWow. Just wow. Bachi Burger really gets it right when it comes to burgers and fries.\u000a\u000aI have been waiting to go to Bachi for awhile. Just waiting for that perfect moment to spend $10+ on a burger. Yes, it is a tad expensive, but honestly it is worth it when you decide to jump in. \u000a\u000aOverall the experience was spot-on and the food was pretty much perfect. I had the Miyagi-San Burger, grass-fed Wagyu beef, Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon, and Crispy Onion Rings, and I added cheddar cheese for an additional charge. This burger came out perfectly, the bun glistened, the egg oozed, the onion rings were crispy, and the cheese was melted perfectly. The beef is high quality, the grilling to medium-well done very nicely. The flavors all work together to make it truly one of the best burgers I have ever eaten.\u000a\u000aMy friend and I also shared the Grilled Shishito Peppers, which are sweet and tasty, with a bit of char. And the sweet potato fries - long-cut, skinny, deliciously sweet and salty as the same time - not one soggy one in the bunch! I highly recommend these fries if you like sweet potatoes!\u000a\u000aAlso of note - they have a good happy hour, with food and drinks. I had a white wine for only 3 bucks, and it was a decent one at that.\u000a\u000aHighly recommended - and my personal return factor is a definite YES.

VBest entertainment on a Friday night I have had in a long time.\u000a\u000aIf you weren't aware there is a drag queen bowling alley, bar, billiards, and yes, it has video games to, and a dance floor *take a deep breathe* awesome place that has opened up Downtown. It's in the Neonopolis Complex and it is AH-MAZE-ING!\u000a\u000aFirst off the decor is awesome and everything is candy for your eyes. There is a large bar situated right in the middle when you walk in. Behind the bar is the dance floor and extra seating. To the left are the bowling lanes and pool tables. And all around you... drag queens and men in hot pants tending bar. Oh did I forget the go-go dancing boys in hot pants as well? Yes, they have those here too.\u000a\u000aThe place is technically a gay bar, but to me it definitely appears to be straight-friendly as well. My friend and I popped in here last night after a Yelp event and we had a great time. \u000a\u000aThe only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because we did wait quite awhile to get served our first drinks. Also, the drag queen who took our order did not know what Maker's Mark was. Hummm... yah, it's whiskey.

VLet me begin this review by saying the 1 star basically goes to management for handling the situation myself and my niece were in a few nights ago when we dined here before going to see a movie. I had never eaten here before, and I did indeed check the reviews before entering this place, but I threw caution to the wind because they had less of a wait time than Yard House. Oh boy, that's where I went wrong.\u000a\u000aThe hostesses were pleasant, and the wait really was not that bad. But then we were sat in this strange booth that was completely separate from the dining room and it was on the side of the bar, but not a part of the bar either because there was a railing between us and the bar. \u000a\u000aI'm not going to completely document our experience, but I am going to highlight a few of the more deplorable offenses. The waiter sniffed my drink to make sure it was Dr. Pepper. WTF moment number 1. We ordered pretty simple dishes because we were indeed going to see a movie. My niece ordered a BLT with the Doritos Mac & Cheese side dish. I ordered half a house salad and the Loaded Baked Potatoes with the Pulled Pork. We then proceeded to wait for 45 minutes before our waiter arrived at our table to tell us there was a big party taking up the kitchen and our meals would be out "very soon". So, we missed our movie. Luckily there was another showing an hour later.\u000a\u000aNext, we waited again for our food. During this time the manager came up to us and apologized, comped our meal, and gave us a free dessert.\u000a\u000aThe meal finally arrived. They brought the incorrect sandwich to my niece. She ordered a BLT and it was a turkey club. She had to wipe all the turkey off of it. The salad was a poor excuse for a salad with tiny witherlings of shaved carrots. The loaded baked potatoes were okay, but the drizzling sauces they put all over it were not my thing. The Doritos Mac & Cheese was seriously one of the worst things I've eaten in my entire life. My niece and I both agreed would wretch right there at the table if we had another bite.\u000a\u000aWe then awaited our cookie (minus the ice cream) so we could take it to go. We waited, and waited, and waited. Our server arrived to inform us it was still being cooked (we already about to be late to the SECOND MOVIE SHOWING). I decided to leave, so we walked out the door. Our waiter (running) met us at the door of the movie theater to give us our absolutely cold and disgusting cookie.\u000a\u000aSad excuse for a place. It will not last.

VTruly a lovely bakery with pastries, confectioneries, gelato, coffees, and scrumptious looking savory treats as well. \u000a\u000aEverything about Chocolate & Spice is above standards for cafes in Vegas. Mostly because there are so few of these gems around town. Typically you are forced to settle for a chain store, such as Starbucks. But C&S comes to the rescue with a spacious cafe with multiple seating options and numerous choices as to what will delight your palate. \u000a\u000aMy friend and I came here after having had lunch and we were on the search for something sweet. We both chose the Nutella Bomb Cake. I got mine with a vanilla latte. Both were perfectly prepared. The cake was not super sweet, but provided just the right amount of dessert for me to be satisfied. I especially enjoyed the Kit-Kat like crisp wafer on the bottom. My latte was actually even better than the cake - served in a nice large cup, accompanied by a saucer so I could sip and enjoy my beverage without the fear of burning my hands while doing so.\u000a\u000aThe comfy animal print chairs are the best place to spend a couple hours chatting and sipping coffees with a friend or two. \u000a\u000aI will be back to Chocolate & Spice very soon.

VWoo hoo! I went to the soft opening night and all I can say is I loved it! There was plenty of appetizers AND wine/beer to go around and it kept coming. I have been waiting for months for the container store to open and now it is here! I will definitely be here over the grand opening weekend to partake in the give-aways and of course, to buy some things I simply fell in love with at the soft opening!\u000a\u000aThe store's space is amazing and well lit. Everything organized very well! (You would hope so, right?). The soft opening was FAB - live music, dancing, food, etc! How can that be beat?\u000a\u000aAs of now The Container Store of Vegas gets 5 Stars from me. :) Cannot wait to begin shopping here and ordering off the website and being able to have my items sent to the store for pickup.\u000a\u000aThank you for coming to Vegas Container Store!

VHere we are a couple days after the grand opening of the Container Store and it's already my second (updated review). I absolutely wanted to do a second review because my first review was of The Container Store's "soft opening" party. \u000a\u000aI have now been back for a full-fledged shopping experience, the Monday after the opening weekend. I still love The Container Store and it is so great they are finally here in Vegas because I have been ordering online from them for awhile. I just enjoy organizing my life and I wish I could organize more and more....\u000a\u000aFirst off, the shopping experience was nice. The store is clean cut, the employees, and the management are shining examples of customer service (more on that later). My only qualm with the store is the shopping carts + people + small aisles = difficulty. When I was there I was walking down an aisle and a family in a shopping cart happened to be at the end of said aisle. Well, the cart + the family + me = disaster in such small aisles. I think it's a minor flaw, one worth noting, but not one that would dissuade me from coming back.\u000a\u000aNext - checkout was easy breezy... until I presented my lovely "Happy Birthday" coupon from The Container Store. Unfortunately there was some confusion, but a manager was called and she quickly took care of the issue. I did not get my birthday prize though... because they could not find it in the store. However, the manager, Robin, was very kind and gave me a reusable shopping bag, gave me the store's number, and told me to call back before I came again to ask if the birthday gifts were available. This was fantastic customer service and I must commend the Container Store's management for their wonderful handling of the situation. \u000a\u000aI will, of course, be back to The Container Store! However could I stay away?

VWhat could I say about Beach Hut Deli sandwiches? Quality. Big. No, huge portions. Order a small and you'll be fine. I am fine for TWO days in fact because a small sandwich can be two lunches for me. Fun, cool island vibe and awesome staff. Oh - brewskis if you want them. Yes, I just said brewskis. Haha.\u000a\u000aI used to visit BHD in Reno when I was in college. I remember the shop opening up and daaaaaaaaayum the sandwiches were good. They're still good today. I was so happy to hear there was a location that opened up here.\u000a\u000aI came in during Noon-time and it actually wasn't even that busy which was surprising, but they must get some good crowds for their happy hour. YES. This sandwich shop has a happy hour.\u000a\u000aI had the flying pig, which has pretty much everything I love in a sandwich. Tasty ham, bacon, avocado, cream cheese, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and thin cut red onions. GAH. I am salivating right now. Order it hot. Or not. Both ways are good.\u000a\u000aMy only issue is this... since there are so very many sandwich places in this particular area it's kind of hard to choose the best. But even though I love BHD, I think Firehouse Subs is better, but that's just my particular taste. Mainly I pick Firehouse over BHD because of the perfect sizing of their sandwiches. Firehouse's sandwiches can actually fit in my mouth, um, as dirty as that sounds. And they are easier to eat. But really, both places are better than Subway or POS. \u000a\u000aBHD - I will be back.

VOver the past year I've realized I really need to appreciate the outdoors around me more. I've gotten out of the city on quite a few occasions lately and I've taken a liking to hiking, even though I am not particularly good at it. This area outside of Vegas is primarily known for being the home of Mt. Charleston. The thing to realize though, is that there's much more to do here than go to Mt. Charleston.\u000a\u000aOn mine and my husband's last venture here we brought our two dogs to go on the North loop hike. This hike is located in the Kyle Canyon area. It's a nice hike, and I love the views you can get as you make each summit. It is up, up, up most of the way, but there are a few areas that allow hikers (like myself) a few moments of ease and the ability to catch your breathe. \u000a\u000aI love the feeling of coming up into the mountains from the valley. It's really just a totally different world. Honestly if you are not coming out here every once and awhile you are doing yourself a disservice just stewing in the Vegas valley.\u000a\u000aGive your lungs some fresh mountain air, give your nose new smells - pine, wildlife, clean air! And give your legs some room to move! There's just nothing like this in the city. You have to get out there and live it.

VVegas gets another new burger joint. I really was never going to go out of my way to eat at Freddy's, but because I happened to be on the side of town where it is located getting my nails done with my sister we decided to go here. I just so happened to see it when we were driving around.\u000a\u000aThe inside reminds me of an Inn N Out with obnoxiously nice employees. I know, how can employees be so nice they are obnoxious? When while in the course of being there for about 30 minutes and we are asked how everything is about 4 times. Okay, I'm complaining for nothing... I concede to the fact. But I am assuming the niceties will only last for so long, until Freddy's is just the 2nd Steak & Shake in Vegas.\u000a\u000aOkay food - I ordered a cheeseburger with fries and a soda, the combo. My sister ordered a hot dog and a water. We shared the fries - it's a good thing we did. The fry portions are massive, which basically does not surprise me anymore. They are shoestring fries though, kind of refreshing... as far as french fries goes.\u000a\u000aMy sister said her "Chicago" dog was tasty and good. My burger was good too. Now I've had the whole "Steakburger" thing. I don't know... is it better than other burgers? I just can't decide. I mean, it was good, but... uuuhhh, I just don't know. I'm just not really impressed.\u000a\u000aWould I go back? Isn't that what it comes down to? When I go get my nails done and on that day I feel like a burger, perhaps I'll stop by Freddy's. But to go out of my way to come here? Nah. \u000a\u000aPS - They have fry sauce. Obvi everyone knows this is ketchup and mayo, but yea, still... FRY SAUCE.

VI normally wouldn't do a review after only one visit. However, Sweet Addiction is very far from where I live. Probably about a 25 minute drive with light traffic. So, with that being said - it is a good thing Sweet Addiction is so far from my house because if they were close I'd be here every weekend getting my sweet tooth on. \u000a\u000aFirst off, it's such a novel concept - ice cream, cookies... who doesn't love ice cream and cookies? Then you put them together - and BAM - well of course, awesome ice cream sandwich with wickedly awesome, fresh baked cookies!\u000a\u000aWhen my fiance and I arrived here on a Sunday evening it was not too busy, although there were a few families eating at the tables when we walked in. The staff was very friendly and were giving samples to the customers in front of us in line. I decided on the chocolate chip cookies (mostly because some had just come out of the oven) and the mocha almond fudge ice cream. My fiance got the cake batter ice cream with the M&M cookies. He said his cookies were a bit tough, but mine were awesomely perfect. Having just come out of the oven they were soft and the little bit of heat gently melted down my delicious Thrifty ice cream so I could squish the sandwich enough to get it dispersed evenly.\u000a\u000aI have never heard of Thrifty ice cream until this shop opened, but apparently it is very popular in California? I noticed no difference between it and other specialty ice creams I've had. I mean, it was good, but the best ice cream I've had in my life? Probably not.\u000a\u000aOverall - such a great concept. Very good portions for a very cheap price. Both mine and my fiance's sandwiches came to just a little over 5 bucks! That's a steal.

VYikes, yikes, yikes. Without my Groupon I would have left here a very, very unhappy camper. Luckily, my friend and I were dining on a Groupon I purchased so I just left disappointed and will never be back.\u000a\u000aThis "English" pub has really no Brit to it, besides the interior and the look of the place, which feels more like it is too big for its own britches. With Americana rock n roll playing overhead and volleyball and basketball playing on the TVs I was having a WTF moment the whole time we dined. Add to that the as always menu you will find anywhere for a "British" establishment in Las Vegas. A majority of the menu is Americana grub food, not British. \u000a\u000aOkay, so what about the food? I was highly disappointed in both my choices. I got the clam chowder - hardly a chowder, mostly white congealed broth with clams in it. When it arrived at the table it had a sheen on it, like it had been sitting around all day in a big colander in the back. I had to pepper the hell out of it to get flavor. Next - the "pub dip" - whatever it is called - it sucks. It is a ciabatta type roll with meandering wads of meat pushed into it served with au jus and a horrid tasting horseradish. I don't know what was wrong with the horseradish, but I'm glad I got it on the side. Why serve this sandwich on a ciabatta roll I must ask, why?! A dip should have nice, squishy, soft bread to soak up the au jus! I was severely disappointed with my meal.\u000a\u000aMy friend has the fish and chips, and the "chips" were fries. Yes, in case you're wondering, "chips" are typically much fatter than the ones they serve at Firkin. She said though that the fish was good, but the batter was a bit heavy.\u000a\u000aAnd lastly - my friend ordered a cider drink and received a Boddington's. Of course, I didn't notice this until she offered the half-drunk drink to me because she said she didn't like it. As I took a big swig, expecting cider, I was awash with the taste of British beer... because I have had Boddington's before. And indeed - there on our receipt it even said one pint of Boddington's. Since the transgression had happened to so long ago, and all I really wanted to do was leave this establishment, which had hardly any patrons in it - we relented and paid our bill.\u000a\u000aNever again frickin Firkin. FRICK I wish I'd never come here!

VHow could I say no to Chocolate and Wine? I could not.\u000a\u000aI got chocolate-wasted at this event. All kinds of chocolates. Chocolates of all shapes and sizes. Oh, and pastries. Yes, the delicious pastries. Throughout the night I sampled from numerous different casinos and chocolatiers from Las Vegas. My girlfriends and I caroused the ballroom floor for who would be pouring the heaviest pour of wine. I don't think we ever really found it...\u000a\u000aThe thing about chocolates (and booze) without real food is a problem though. Sweets eventually make your tummy go - STOPPIT GIVE ME SOMETHING NOT SWEET DUMMY! And mine did.\u000a\u000aFor the future, I suggest the event get rid of the jewelry displays and have in its place a REAL food vendor. Anything that is not sweets. \u000a\u000aSince the event benefited St. Jude's I cannot complain too much. After all the chocolates were all very, very good. I think the atmosphere was a tad boring. And honestly I am glad I did not pay $75, but instead got the Travelzoo deal for $35.

VBoy have I not been in a coffee place like this in awhile. Since being back in Vegas for about 5 years since my stint in Reno for college I have never come across a coffee shop that compared to many locally owned coffee shops in Reno. Basically Las Vegas was lacking that vibe, that "cool coffee shop" vibe. Even though I have tried out a couple locally owned places they still felt as though they had that corporate vibe.\u000a\u000aTa da! Here is The Coffee House on Water Street in Henderson (or Hendertucky, whichever you prefer). As soon as I walked in I had that feeling like I always had walking into Java Jungle in downtown Reno. It was just cool. It was just coffee. It was just a laid back place to sit, enjoy, and promote local - anything! \u000a\u000aWhen I walked in there was no one there! And there was no one behind the counter... I was afraid they were closed, but a nice gentleman came out to the counter and greeted me. He was very... chill.\u000a\u000aThe menu is slightly limited, but I did note they had some "exotic" drinks. I will try those next time. This time I just went for a 20 oz Mocha. Only $3.50! That is a steal. I noted they have food, but I wasn't interested in that for this trip. \u000a\u000aI am not a fan of the styrofoam cups, but the mocha was delicious! Before I left the gentleman behind the counter informed me there would be a open mic later that night. Very cool! \u000a\u000aYou should check this place out. Support local business! When I am back in the Henderson area I will make it a point to stop by.

VThis commissary has been in my family's rotation for quite sometime. I have seen it change a lot as well. I even used to frequent it before it changed locations on the base. \u000a\u000aOverall you'll be able to find your necessities here, along with a few specialty items you may need for that special dish you'll be making during your work week. The spacious commissary offers wide aisles for numerous people to be milling their ways through their shopping trips. Of course, the commissary is known to me for doing my monthly shopping, so I need plenty of space and time to get all my groceries.\u000a\u000aThe produce section is quite large and they sometimes bring in fruits and veggies that aren't so run-of-the-mill. I do find their bakery section to be disappointing sometimes, as I have tried to look for fresh pita bread here once and they did not have any. However, next to the bakery is a great place to pick up a sandwich or a sub, they make very good ones there and you'll find the service members often here on lunch breaks getting a sandwich. There is also a sushi place, which I have yet to try, but my husband says it is good. I'll take his word for it, for now.\u000a\u000aSince the renovation they have added "fast" and "self checkout" lanes, which is quite nice. But since I'm normally here buying a whole basket full of food, I rarely use them.\u000a\u000aCashiers are typically very nice and the baggers are too. Don't forget to bring a tip if they're helping you out to your car!

VA clean-cut, hip type establishment in a shopping center hefty with numerous options of good eats. 808 may not stand out much in this strip mall loaded with numerous eating options, but it should not be over-looked.\u000a\u000aThe establishment itself is decently sized with a temporary design. The bar is situated to the right hand corner, while dining areas are around the left side and in the front of the restaurant. Service was on-spot while my friend and I dined here during a not-so-busy afternoon. In fact, we were the only patrons the entire time we were here. I assume this place gets busy in the later hours of the evening.\u000a\u000aThe menu is pleasing, with an extensive amount of tapas and sushi to choose from. Lunch menu items were somewhat of a disappointment and did not entice me. Instead I chose from the main dining menu.\u000a\u000a808 Ceviche - Definitely not like any ceviche I have had, as this ceviche was not made entirely of fish, but small pieces of rock shrimp and scallops. There was way too much corn in it and too much lime. It was not really ceviche in my opinion as ceviche should be primarily fish (or whatever seafood you're using), this was not. Although the taro chips served with it were tasty.\u000a\u000aBanzai Pipeline - Basically their version of a rainbow roll. Although very good, and a nice assortment of fish, A+ on presentation and tightly wrapped rolls.\u000a\u000aDynamite - A seafood mix with mushrooms and special sauce. I've never been a huge fan of this type of dish, but it was decent.\u000a\u000aOctopus Salad - Probably the best dish besides the sushi. A very lefy green spinach salad topped with a yummy good helping of octopus and a nice, light dressing.\u000a\u000aOverall I think this place is a great restaurant to visit. Plus, the menu leaves me desiring to come back and try out more options. Good job!

VLet me preface this review by giving a quick run down of how my friend and I finally arrived at eat. We were walking here from Downtown3rd Farmer's Market, which I knew would be just a quick few blocks up Fremont Street and to Carson Street. Of course, so easy!\u000a\u000aAs we walked and noted certain street signs were missing from certain streets we we ended up walking about six blocks PAST Carson where we should have made a left! OY VEY.\u000a\u000aAnyway, eat is a brand new edition to the Downtown scene and a nice little place to drop in for some good, quick bites. The menu features salads, sandwiches and small sides. When we were there only the lunch menu was being featured, although I am aware they serve breakfast as well. \u000a\u000aMy friend and I both opted for the chicken mozzarella sandwich with a pesto sauce and tomatoes. All sandwiches come with a choice of their homemade potato chips or potato salad. We both opted for the chips. They were crispy, brown and yummy. However, a very sad day for us. Each sandwich also comes with a pickle and they were out of pickles. *tear* We actually really were disappointed.\u000a\u000aAs for the sandwich, I thought it was good, although not blowing my socks off. Would I come back and eat it and probably try more of their sandwiches? Yes, I would. Especially since I have been wishing for so long a place like this existed on the Eastside of the Valley. Now - here it is! In my fave place - Downtown! And is just about a 10 minute drive from my house! \u000a\u000aHere's the thing - the place is SO LOUD. LOOOOUUUDDD. If the place is packed good luck carrying on a decent conversation with whoever you're with without yelling - you won't be able to. Although I like the atmosphere and the way the place looks, I think they could use something to tone down how freaking loud it gets in this place. \u000a\u000aBy the way - avoid street parking by parking in the El Cortez parking garage, it's just a short walk away. Bingo. Awesome new place to eat.

VFIVE STARS.\u000a\u000aI'm bumping up my review of eat to a fiver after my breakfast yesterday morning.\u000a\u000aI entered eat around 10 AM hungry for some breakfast action not knowing exactly what I would get. I've been here once before for breakfast and had the truffled egg sandwich (delicious!), but this time I went with the Chilaquiles Scrambled Eggs, What the... this is what breakfast is made of my friends. Everything about this meal from the ingredients, to the execution, to the presentation was perfect. I was so satisifed with this meal I was thinking about the great review I was going to give it while I was eating it. Not to mention, I cleaned my plate. \u000a\u000aThis delicious meal is scrambled eggs, turken, jalapeno mango sausage, \u000acorn tortilla chips, cheddar, red & green new mexican chili. The mango sausage is the star that pulls everything together because it has an amazingly sweet, savory, and spicy taste to it that plays on your taste-buds.\u000a\u000aI've been in here when there were a few more people (as in the place was packed) and the loudness leaves a bit to be desired for ambiance, but my breakfast was calm with minimal noise even though there were quite a few patrons (and myself) sitting at the bar.\u000a\u000aWhat also gets to my heart is the fact that they use locally grown produce here from Caliente, NV. I love it. We need to get back to that idea of using what is near us instead of stuff that is miles and miles away.\u000a\u000aOverall, love eat. I will go back to eat here again and again.

VThis place is the perfect spot in the new terminal at McCarran. The fact that it is an offering that is not Starbucks is awesome. Not that I don't like Starbucks, but variety is the spice to life!\u000a\u000aThe space is efficient and has plenty of seating. It is open to the main walkway of the terminal, so you can people watch while sitting at a table.\u000a\u000aI've had numerous drinks here, as well as bagels (which they will toast for you yay!). Anything I've gotten has been good, hot, and served quickly.\u000a\u000aOverall, for a place in an airport The Coffee Bean is surpassing most others.

VI just.... can't.\u000a\u000aAbout a year ago I swore off Five Guys. They had appeared on the Vegas scene in all their glory and they have since multiplied. I visited 5 Guys in Henderson, and 5 Guys in North Vegas. Each time I just was not completely impressed. The burger, to me, was too loaded with stuff, it was too compacted in the foil, the mustard and ketchup and mayo was all over the place. The fries, although good, were too many, too much, ridiculous. I don't want a bag of fries - I wanted a little cup of fries, why is that so hard to do 5 Guys? I get it. It's their thing, but I guess I just don't like it.\u000a\u000aCompare this with Inn N Out, clean, fresh, nicely wrapped burgers. Crispy lettuce, not too many condiments. French fries - perfect, crispy, lightly salted, and served in a nice clean-looking white tray. The fries are not spilling all over your burger in the bag. No. They are just as they should be - contained.\u000a\u000aI tried 5 Guys again. I happened to be shopping at Target. I happened to be hungry. It had been awhile so I thought maybe, just maybe I would give 5 Guys another shot. And it all came back to me...\u000a\u000aIt's just not my cup of tea.\u000a\u000aOnly cool thing - New-Age Coke Machines. BUT. Firehouse Subs have these popular machines as well. I will go to Firehouse Subs next time, or Inn N Out... anywhere but 5 Guys.

VThe lights were a fun distraction from the hustle and bustle of the holidays. Myself, my husband, my parents, and my brother went last night. We got there at about 9:30 PM and had to wait in a line of cars for about 20 minutes just to get in! We didn't get into the drive for the lights until about 10:15 PM. They closed at 10 PM. Luckily they didn't kick people out who were already in line before 10.\u000a\u000aThey've done a great job and who doesn't like to look at Christmas lights? Plus, you can drive in the comfort of your car to see them. \u000a\u000aThe people working here were very cordial and happy. The Boy Scouts were giving out hats to children and selling hot cocoa, although we didn't not indulge in any. There's also a radio station they tell you to tune into that is specifically playing Christmas music for the event.\u000a\u000aThe only thing I did not like was that some of the displays had nothing to do with the holidays. I get that different companies sponsored the lights and they wanted to be represented, but still... I wish all the displays had had some sort of holiday theme to them. Other than that - very cool thing to do during the holidays.

VAh, Burger King on the base - because there aren't many other options.\u000a\u000aStopped here on a few occassions, typically when I'm on base with family. BK is not high on my list of places I like to patron on the regular, but it will do in certain cases.\u000a\u000aPerks - No tax. Shares dining room with Popeyes. Other customers are nice. Dining room well kept and clean.\u000a\u000aCons - Employees seem... A little out of it sometimes? On a recent trip the cheese on my Whopper wasn't even melted. Prep of food could use improvement.\u000a\u000aWhy go? You're on base and it's convenient. But honestly I'd pick getting sandwiches or sushi at the commissary over BK 99.9% of the time.

VFirehouse Subs opens up closer to me! Granted it's still a drive, but it's the closest one to me now. And it's in an area of town I often frequent.\u000a\u000aI stopped by today while running errands in the Henderson area and the place was packed. There were only two tables open, and it was about 1:30 in the afternoon. As with other Firehouse Subs this one has that (obvious) this place is made by firefighters feel. From the dalmatian spot tables to the firefighter jackets hanging behind the place where the employees are working.\u000a\u000aI did wait about 10 minutes for my sandwich to be made. That IS a little long considering this is a sandwich place competing with other places like Subway that make sandwiches pretty darn fast. It's kind of weird to me that sandwiches come out that slow considering how many employees there are working behind the counter. However - all sandwiches are warmed up so maybe that is where the extra bit of time comes into play - I'm not sure. Even though the wait was a bit long I LOVED my favorite Hook & Ladder.\u000a\u000aWhile I waited I got a few hot sauces, and there are plenty of them. Do not miss getting some sauces to put on your sandwich. I personally like the Firehouse Subs signature sauce, it reminds be of Batch 88 from Quiznos.\u000a\u000aOverall I will return to this Firehouse Subs quite a bit I am sure. They are still currently my favorite place to get a sandwich. Oh remember - they give you a pickle with your sandwich combo!

VCome for Happy Hour at the bar area and leave. \u000a\u000aMy friends and I decided to check out The View last night for happy hour. Unfortunately they do not serve any food at their happy hour. Draft wines for $2 though, are a steal. However the wines are not of the greatest quality. They also serve Stella Artois (on draft) for $3. AS much as I liked the prices, the service was mediocre. My friends and I waited to pay our bills for a good 10 minutes while the one bar server made cheese boards. She literally was away from all of her bar patrons for a good 5-7 minutes. In bar time - that is a really long time not to be able to talk to the people at your bar and get them more drinks. \u000a\u000aWe then were seated in the dining area, which is really nice and open with awesome chairs that made me feel like I could sit there for hours. We also got a pretty awesome spot in front of a window in front of Tivoli's fountain. \u000a\u000aI found their wine menu to be somewhat of a disappointment. Yes, they offer a decent variety, but when I think "Wine Bar" I was expecting a booklet, not a page. Also, wines from France were sorely missing. There was only two, one of which you could only order per bottle. California and Washington varietals are center stage here. I ordered the "dryer" Riesling for $13, which I thought was decent enough, although I've had better. \u000a\u000aFood - I wanted the 5 Cheese Soup, but was informed they were out, in a hurry, and not really thinking, I ordered the Tomato Soup instead. What I was served was a puddle of tomato soup in a huge bowl. I will honest-to-God say the bowl had 6 spoonfuls of soup in it. At $6 a pop for a sip of soup I found it to be a huge let-down. Be conscious the style here is "tapas", small plates for sharing, but really, was I going to share my 6-spoonfuls of soup? Hell no I wanted a bowl of soup!\u000a\u000aI also had the "Green Eggs and Ham" Carbonara, which was delicious. The sauces were perfect, the addition of the egg was perfect. The crispy pork belly was not crispy. It was a lump of pork, flaccid and not up to par. I wish I had gotten an entire plate, again, I was severely disappointed at the size of my pasta, especially considering I was STILL hungry after I had finished it. I was wishing I had gone to Brio across the street and paid the same exact amount of money and gotten a huge-ass plate of spaghetti.\u000a\u000aI like the idea, but I do not like the execution of The View. I will always compare tapas (no matter what they are) to Firefly, and Firefly beats this place out hands down a million times over. Also, Nosh & Swig, a place that also does "American" tapas is better than The View with cheaper prices and better quality/quantity of food presentation. \u000a\u000aService in the dining area was okay, but somewhat awkward. We were given a horrible "appetizer" (for free...) that consisted of cold peanuts, a thin slice of radish, a weird dried-out carrot, and what I think was two celery sticks. Mind you, there were three girls sitting at my table, whatever would we want with this weird concoction of "food"? \u000a\u000aService - 3/5\u000aFood - 2.5/5\u000aAmbiance - 4/5\u000a\u000aI will not make a return trip. There are places with better wine and better food that will not leave me yearning for an Inn N Out burger after my meal.

VThis was my first time at Vegas Foodie Fest. I have wanted to go in the past, but my work schedule always got in the way. Welp, yesterday I finally made it! My husband and I met up with some friends here and I have to say, I thought the event was better than I was expecting!\u000a\u000aThe older I get the less desirous I become of going to these types of events. The hustle to get in, the bloated prices, the noise, too many people, etc. Luckily though... my husband and I didn't wait too long to get in to the event. Probably about 6 minutes. The line went fast. They gave my husband a Military discount, but not me. (Err, okay. Most places will give the entire family of the active duty person the discount, but to each their own I guess.) So I paid full price. \u000a\u000aOnce we got in we went immediately to the food trucks, away from the carnie rides and the... car show? Odd assortments of cars were on display. Oookay. Anyway, back to the food.\u000a\u000aDevilicous Truck: We got the Parm Truffle Fries and a Guava Lemonade to start out. I got this lemonade because it was the cheapest drink out of all the trucks at $3.50. All the other trucks were selling specialty drinks for $5! Highway robbery! I like this drink, it was really tart, with a bit of sweet. The fries were pretty tasty with big chunks of grated Parmesan on them.\u000a\u000aMuncheez: My husband wanted a grilled cheese from this truck. I did not. I've been burned by Muncheez in the past, but I think maybe they've refined their menu since I last had them. My husband got a simple "create-your-own" grilled cheese. Cheese, ham and sourdough. It was all right. But we waited way too long to get it.\u000a\u000aSin City Hot Dogs: I got the Boulevard dog as my main meal. After much agonizing I felt as though this truck had really interesting combos of food at the right prices. I paid $7 for my dog and it was AWESOME. Big, juicy, and meaty. The bun was not dry, but a very nice bread. And the toppings were out of this world - grilled onions, mayo, mustard, jalapeno sauce, and a layer of re-fried beans underneath. Two thumbs up!\u000a\u000aBaconMania: For our last indulgence we got the deep fried bacon wrapped brownie bites, covered in Hershey's melted chocolate. Wow. I mean, I hate to say it, but these were really, really good. \u000a\u000aOverall I enjoyed the Foodie Fest. I would return to another. I think food truck prices in general are a bit steep. I mean, 5 bucks for a drink? MEH! But... I guess it's just the price you pay for these "all-star" trucks and their food. I think you just have to really search to get your monies worth. The $10 price to get in isn't bad... but I hope they never raise the price. I don't see myself paying more than that to get in the door and the spend MORE money on the inflated food prices.

VLima Limon sits in a desolate shopping center off of Decatur Blvd. It is next door to a Port of Subs. You will see the bright yellow/green sign and then enter into what is definitely 1950s diner vibe. Not sure what that is about - but maybe they are just waiting to revamp.\u000a\u000aService was exceptionally nice. I believe this place is definitely a mom-n-pop place as the waiter took great pride in talking to myself and my co-worker about the types of food, how it is made, etc. He even brought out an iPad so we could scroll through and see what the dishes looked like before we ordered.\u000a\u000aI've never had Peruvian food before. The menu is straight and to the point. Most meals are simple: a meat, a carb, and a few veggies. In fact, some dishes come with both fries AND rice. It is somewhat reminiscent to me, of Hawaiian food, that comes with macaroni salad AND rice. However, Peruvian food obviously has an Asian-influence as I could distinctly taste soy sauce, and the "pasta" that came with my dish was very much like noodles you may find in an Asian dish.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Tallarines Saltado with chicken. This is a BIG dish of food. Noodles were cooked perfectly, and chicken was good. Very few vegetables though - I thought I would get more tomatoes, but there were only two in my dish. Overall, the meal was good, but not great. Not sure if this is just because of the Peruvian dish itself - or the restaurant.\u000a\u000aI would like to try Peruvian food elsewhere to see how it compares. For now, an A-OK will do.

VHusband and I walked this trail with our dogs this morning around 7:30 AM. It started out coolish warm for a Vegas day, but as we walked it definitely got warmer.\u000a\u000aThis trail is part of a section of trails in Henderson. It runs the length of St. Rose Parkway from The M to Eastern, I believe. My husband and I did not make it that far. Our black lab was seriously hating the heat by the time we got to mile marker 2. He was running for what little shade could afford him. Luckily we brought plenty of water for us and the dogs because although there are poop-bag stations there are no water stations/bathrooms along the way. At least not in the part we walked.\u000a\u000aAlthough I like the trail being paved, it's best for cyclists and not really just walkers with their dogs. It's kind of boring, you get a really great view of the cars on St. Rose, but not much else. I mean the mountains to the right and the Henderson Airport are kind of cool to check out, but it is from a very, very far distance. \u000a\u000aAs for a walking trail I'm gonna say A-OK for this one. It would definitely be better had I been on my bike. If I had been biking this one it would have probably been a 4-star. BUT since the trail SEEMS to try and be walker/dog friendly I gotta rate it equally fair for both and that's why I gotta go with just the three stars.

VPer usual I was drinking on Fremont Street when....\u000a\u000aMy friend and I noted this gorgeous new establishment next to Le Thai and across the street from our most coveted bar - Vanguard. After having drinks at Vanguard we heartily agreed it would be a good idea to check out Commonwealth, the new addition to Fremont East.\u000a\u000aThe bar is spacious, reaching all the way across the "warehouse" like interior. I say warehouse because of the large, open ceilings. Interesting artwork is dispersed throughout the bar and it is adorned with furniture that resembles perhaps a speak-easy/British vibe.  Everything here is visual eye candy from the view you can have from the patio of Fremont East down to the saucily adorned bathrooms. \u000a\u000aAs for drinks, my friend and I decided on some cocktails from their specialty menu, which much like Vanguard features awesome mixed concoctions you aren't going to find many other places. I forget what I had, but it was recommend because of the sweet cherry flavor. I enjoyed it, but had originally wanted something off of their "Hot Drinks" menu. Ah! So fabulous for them to have THAT menu, but alas, they couldn't make their hot drinks on the night we were there. \u000a\u000aI'm withholding a 5 star rating until I go back for a second visit. Hopefully I can try one of their hot drinks when I return. Also, they did have a bit of trouble getting my debit card to run and I was bit antsy when someone simply walked off to the back with it (probably to run it on another POS system). But that didn't sour my mood too much on the place, especially since the bartenders were congenial and helpful.\u000a\u000aWill definitely be back soon.

VQuick update.\u000a\u000aAs I said I would update my review after another outing to Commonwealth, I am doing just that. I came here with a group of friends for the festivities of a birthday party. \u000a\u000aWe snagged a booth with ottoman seating for our group and awaited drinks from a cocktail server. She was compliant with our needs, but service was kind of slow. I ordered the "Little Hot Mess", which was a stellar drink. Sweet for sure and easy to drink. \u000a\u000aThis night there was quite a mix of people. I saw business men, young collegeish looking men, young ladies in mini skirts and high heels, as well as some hipster looking folk. Needless to say the bar attracts quite a crowd.\u000a\u000aI'm holding on at 4 stars mainly because it is a GOOD bar, but still, it's a bar. The drink prices are a bit high for typical shots and beers, even though I think their mixed drink prices are reasonable. I'm only saying this because a friend of our party ordered PBR and they charged him $7. HUH?! Yes. That's just silly.

VIf you are looking for French without the price that tends to be attached to French food in Las Vegas, look no further, La Belle is for you! Located in a shopping mall on West Sahara, La Belle beckoned me while I was traversing the area looking for a hair salon I had never been to, but had an appointment with.\u000a\u000aAfter my hair appointment my hunger led me to La Belle. What a great choice I made. La Belle is French, and down to the core French indeed. It is a bakery/cafe, serving up loaves of bread, sandwiches, soups, salads, and patisseries. I got the turkey, brie, apple, and walnut sandwich on their cibatta bread. The brie was very tangy, not the same 'ol brie you are used to everywhere else. I was actually taken aback by the tanginess of the cheese. Yes, my friends this is *true* French food.\u000a\u000aLa Belle also serves Peet's coffee and they brew it with their own water. Yes. They have a specialized filtration system that all of their water runs through. I learned this from a "factoid" sheet in the bathroom. Well. I'm impressed.\u000a\u000aI also left the cafe with two tarts - a blueberry and an apricot which I will be sharing later with my husband. From the looks/smells coming from them I imagine they will be delicious.

VWe did not do any swigging, but plenty of noshing.\u000a\u000aMy friend and I ventured to Nosh & Swig at about 6 PM on a Thursday night. We were starving, having fasted all day and we were ready for tapas. I was also equipped with a $20 Groupon so we were ready to do some eating. \u000a\u000aThe place itself has a "cool" vibe, with metallic chairs and tables. This is complimented by large sayings on the walls and interesting art work. The space itself though I felt was a little... "cold". I think if there had been more people there it would have felt a bit less that way. However, only one other person arrived during the time we were there.\u000a\u000aThis is what we ordered -\u000a\u000aSmokey Poke ($8) - I love poke and this poke was quite good with, yes, a "smokey" flavor and some kind of sauce with a few potato chips served on the side. \u000a\u000aPretzel Brats ($8) - Chicken sausage, pretzel bread, deliciousness. I LOVED this dish. I wish I had had two. I will be ordering it again.\u000a\u000aHodgepodge ($11) - Just as the name implies this came with french fries (eh), sweet potato fries (eh), tater tots (pretty good!), onion rings (yummy, light exterior, very good)\u000a\u000aDragon Claws ($7.5) - Spicay! I had one of the three because they were a bit spicy for my palate for some reason. Usually I'm all about spice, but just not tonight. However, for those looking for a kick - get these! Jalapeno. Spicy Tuna. Yum.\u000a\u000aDessert! We wanted the cookiemon - they were out. Nothing else was really appealing to us, so the waitress suggested the chef just whip us up some chocolate ice cream with chocolate chips on it. It was a nice end to our meal.\u000a\u000aCustomer service was fantastic. Our food came out quickly and our drinks were refilled numerous times. My card was accidentally run for the full amount of the meal instead of the price with the Groupon, but it was quickly fixed. I get it - sometimes stuff like that happens. And they even gave me a $10 gift card!\u000a\u000aAwesome spot. So awesome it is on the East side. I love it and I will be back!

VNope. Not even close to being a good burger.\u000a\u000aAfter getting off of work I was craving a burger and fries. I thought I should try something different and new. And since it was 9 PM I knew I had limited choices. There happens to a be a newish Farmer Boys near the airport off of Eastern so I decided to give them a try. I went through the drive-thru and my order took awhile. Not sure why - but the burgers are pre-formed (obviously) so I am not sure what was going on, especially since the employee apologized for my wait.\u000a\u000a1 star for being able to do add-ons such as avocado to your burger\u000a1 star for serving breakfast (even though I haven't had it)\u000a\u000aBut other than that... meh.\u000a\u000aI ordered the cheeseburger with an add-on of avocado, unfortunately it was more like a mess of avocado on my burger. Like a mix between guac and avocado slices. I wasn't thrilled. I especially wasn't thrilled because it did not go well with the fact that they put Thousand Island on their burgers as a sauce. Plus - there was hardly ANY Thousand Island on my cheeseburger making it a very dry cheeseburger indeed.\u000a\u000aAgain - patty was thin, but large, the burger was large, but again, the beef patty was incredibly thin. The bun was actually quite good. Fluffy and large and soft. But still... the cheeseburger it was just so... meh.\u000a\u000aFries - oy. Forget the fries here. There's not a thing special about them. A bunch of mine were actually brittle and burned. The others - okay, they're fries. I'd rather have McDonald's or Inn-N-Out french fries.\u000a\u000aPossibility of return - not high.

VSecond try at Farmer Boys....\u000a\u000aIn my original review I said I would not go back, but Farmer Boys lured me in. Mostly because it is so close to where I work and when I get off work I have limited options as to where I can eat. Typically I try not to eat out during my work week, but this past week I was being lazy because I had had a head cold. So - cheeseburger to the rescue!\u000a\u000aThis time I went with the "Natural Burger", which I honestly enjoyed much more than their regular cheeseburger. The cheese was really melted into the patty, which was nice. But there were a lot of onions on the burger I ended up picking off. Next time I'll just say no onions. \u000a\u000aInstead of fries I ordered onion rings, but ummm I really, really did not like these rings. They were just really not the style I like. The breading was falling off before I got home (because I'll be honest I DID eat one while driving down the road). The batter is very thin and the rings are very big and chunky. I think this is really just a preference thing - but the onion rings here were not for me.\u000a\u000aNew overall opinion - A-OK. Would I go back? Yes. Would I order the onion rings? No. Maybe I'll just stick strictly with the burgers and try the breakfasts some time.

VThe al pastor taco is where it's at my friends. The beautiful pork has an almost smokey BBQ flavor you just get lost in and savor with each bite.\u000a\u000aThus far I have had the following from Taco Taco:\u000a\u000aCarne Asada - All right. I've had better. It needed a bit more flavor in my opinion. The meat does have some fat and gristle on it, but not much. It is a decent meat option.\u000a\u000aSOYRIZO - yes, you read that right. This crazy little concoction doesn't even taste like it's not meat. I've had it twice and being that I prefer to have meat in my tacos it is really saying something that I've ordered a soyrizo taco twice!\u000a\u000aCarnitas - Hmmm. Needs further exploration. The taco I got was a bit too juicy. Too much running out of the meat. I suppose it's better than it being dry though. I liked it better after I put some sauce on it.\u000a\u000aAL PASTOR - JUST ORDER THIS OKAY? If you're going to get one thing here go with the all pastor. It's delicious.\u000a\u000aI've only had these meats as tacos. And the tacos come in two sizes. I usually just go with the small size so I can get more tacos. So, more variety. The tortillas are handmade there.\u000a\u000aCorn on the cob - Hello deliciousness I have never had before! Wow these things are big and totally worth it. They sprinkle it with cheese, paprika, and something else, but whatever it is it's the best corn you may ever eat.\u000a\u000aSalsa bar is bomb. So many different choices. Plus limes, cucumbers, pickled veggies, and jalapeos! \u000a\u000aOverall the food is amazeballs and the staff is incredibly nice. The restaurant is clean. So basically, just go to Taco Taco. NOW. What are you waiting for?!

VMy second review.\u000a\u000aTaco Taco has become a weekly tradition for me. I come after work on Fridays as a gift to myself for all my good behavior of not dining out and not buying food during my work week I end my Friday by hitting up Taco Taco. \u000a\u000aI have come to love their burritos and although I am a fan of tacos I have always been more of a fan of burritos. Upon first coming here I ordered tacos, because well, the name. But after returning a few times I branched out. Believe me, everything here is good, not just the tacos.\u000a\u000aMany have compared this place to kind-of-sort-of Chipotle. I sort of agree. The burritos here are made in the same fashion - pick your meat, pick your other ingredients. I LOVE their pollo here. It has such an amazing flavor and the rice has a rich flavor as well. Beans are on spot and the tortillas are perfect - not too thin, not too thick. \u000a\u000aNeedless to say I love this place. I just want to tell the (Yelp) world!

VPizza - GOOD!!!\u000aCustomer service - UGH.\u000a\u000aMy friend and I saw this place was opening up months ago and we were very excited to try it. We always happy hour downtown at Vanguard so we figured this would be a perfect place to grab a bite of pizza after drinking. We assumed they'd offer pizza by the slice because pretty much every pizza joint Downtown does.\u000a\u000aUpon entering we noted a hostess stand outside, but no hostess, so we walked in. The space is SMALL. As soon as we walked in we were already in the pizza place. There is no area to stand around and not look like a fool if you don't know where you're going. Luckily a hostess (who would turn into our waitress arrived). She asked if it were for two and we said yes, she seated us in their restaurant section which is basically right next to their bar section.   As for decor, it's nicely set up, except for the fact that there is an overload of televisions. And every single one of them was on basketball. My friend and I came to the conclusion that their space over at Tivoli Village must have been bigger and they just weren't willing to give up all those flat screens, so hey, just put 'em everywhere. Seriously guys, lose some of the TVs. Your customers will not miss them.\u000a\u000aThe night we were there they were offering a limited menu and they were upfront about it, which was nice. At least we didn't go through their full menu and decide on something they did not have. BUT we were disappointed to see the menu offered no option for just ordering by the slice. We got over it and decided to order an 18" Viva Las Vegas which had pepperoni, a meat I can't remember right now, onions, yellow peppers and white sauce. All of their specialty pizzas sound really good and I would like to go back and try more. Sometimes places do specialty pizzas and you're like WTF? No. But RCP has really good-sounding concoctions.\u000a\u000aOur pizza comes out and it looks delicious and smells delicious. We dig right in. First off the crust (for me) was perfect, crunchy, but had that nice chewy texture you get with good NY style pizza. The toppings were salty and sweet and just made this wonderful little pizza-goodness opera in my mouth.\u000a\u000aThen comes the downfall of our whole experience.... \u000a\u000aWe noted the pizza had not been cut completely. There were slices that actually should have been two slices and not one. I picked one up and it was bigger than my face, so naturally, we just asked if we could have the pizza cut. Our waitress then laid a lovely little explanation/insult on us.\u000a\u000a"Well, this is not Dominos or Pizza Hut, it's NY style pizza so it's bigger than you're used to."\u000a\u000aEXCUSE ME? My friend and I were aghast as our haughty little waitress took our pizza away to be cut "Dominos-style" to our peasant liking (apparently). Instead of just cutting our pizza she insults us. Nice touch.\u000a\u000aAnd you know what? I like Dominos AND Pizza Hut so there. Oh and by the way - if there's one food I know pretty much everything about - it's PIZZA! And I certainly know what a NY style slice of pizza looks like. Okay? Pizza is (langauge) fucking pizza, all right? So just cut my fucking pizza.\u000a\u000aI want to go back to try more, but obviously my Dominos-ass should stay home and order pizza to be delivered.

VOut of all the theaters in Vegas I gotta give it up to Rave. Honestly, they are the best place in Vegas to catch a movie. From their spacious, cushy seats, to the perfect location, you can't beat seeing a movie here.\u000a\u000aThe movie theater sets atop a staircase above Town Square, like a lofty God it looks down upon its meandering patrons and other stores. It's an adventure to climb the stairs knowing you are about to sit down for some awesomeness (hopefully) and emerge with  wonderment at your most recent movie viewing.\u000a\u000aThe seats are HUGE compared to other movie theater seats. It's awesome and the arm rests provide a ton of room to put your popcorn and drink on. You feel like you're in your own little place while watching movie, displaced from the others in the theater.\u000a\u000aRave also provides loyalty cards, so if you don't have one - get one! I don't even go to the movies that often, but I know I would love to accumulate enough movies to get a free showing. Now that's something everyone can enjoy. \u000a\u000aLoyalty cards, perfect location, spacious seating. What more to ask for? The customer service has been good here too, never have I had a rude individual or been put-off by the employees. Overall it's good - it's as good as it gets!

VDowntown has become my haven of lunch time and solo time eating. I'm typically by myself during lunch time and I don't cuurrr! I am definitely an independent girl and can have a meal solo so downtown spots are perfect for that. I decided to give Rachel's Kitchen a whirl since I often went to the one in The District in Green Valley. Unfortunately The District got turned into The ROAD o CARS so I have been avoiding that area. I realize Downtown is no different, but The District *used* to have charm... not so much anymore.\u000a\u000aAnyway, enough of my ranting - I like the fact this RK is Downtown. I like that it is in The Ogden, what I don't like is me driving past it twice looking for a place to park! *shakes fist* Well, I ended up metering, but I have gotten over that hump of going Downtown. So I meter. I don't care, pretty much every major city EXCEPT Las Vegas has meters everywhere for parking so I have come to terms.\u000a\u000aThis RK is set up quite the same as the one in The District with the great looking green-tiled tables and the nice snuggly cafe vibe. The employees were very sweet when I was here and offered honey/lemons for my tea and answered my questions regarding the soup of the day.\u000a\u000aI really was hankering for soup/sandwich combo which RK has for $9.75. I say that's a decent price especially since you get a bowl of soup, not a cup. \u000a\u000aTurkey/Bacon/Avocado Sandwich (on sourdough) & Potato Cheddar Soup - The soup startled me because when it came out it was bright orange. I was like, "What is this trickery potato soup?" But, as I spooned the deliciously pureed potato and cheese into my mouth I decided it was quite delicious. I am sure the orange hue comes from copious amount of cheddar cheese, so ya know, fat girl status up in here! As for the sandwich it was a bit of a let-down. The bread was dry dry dry and did not have the richness I was expecting from a nice sourdough. I have a suspicion it was day(s) old bread. And there was an extra piece of bread in it which I didn't care for and removed. The turkey was all right and in my wold avocados make anything better, so it saved the sandwich a bit but not much.\u000a\u000aPeach & Ginger Black Tea - I would come back for their teas to be honest. Sitting downtown sipping this amazing tea they have would be perfect on any winter day. I can't remember the name of the teas but the next time I go back I am writing it down in case I can get it for my own enjoyment at home.\u000a\u000aOverall - Food-wise could use a little work. I hope when I go back the next thing I order completely redeems the dry bread. Ambiance, service, and overall experience was positive. Four stars it is for now.

VWhat I thought would be an amazing experience for happy hour turned into a rather mediocre dining experience complete with garbage truck/sewage smell. The entire experience was pretty much ruined by this and had I known the stench would continually waft over our party while we ate I definitely would have chosen a seat outside.\u000a\u000aBut ah! The name is "Park" on Fremont, and the incredibly tack-full back patio is what this place is also about of course! Unless you are attempting to eat while foul sewage is creeping into your nostrils. Unfortunately this aspect is one I flatly refuse to lure myself into again. If I go back to Park on Fremont I will sit at the bar and leave the stinky patio be.\u000a\u000aFood - Veggie Sliders of BORINGNESS. First off the sliders have the right idea, fresh enough veggies, interesting combo, but there was ZERO taste. It was bland, bland, bland and it came with NO sauce. No sauce at all. Um, not even like some veganaise? I'm not a vegetarian, but these sounded/looked yummy. They need seasoning. Please, for the love of all the is good - season the food!\u000a\u000aDrink - Drink menu is pretty darn cool. Beer selection is cool. Although I was brought out the *other* raspberry beer that was in stock, rather than the one I actually requested. None the less - delicious. And at $10, I thought yikes! But when I saw it was a Pint I knew I would not even need another drink. My friend had one of their Bloody Mary's, which I tasted and it was yummy. Mixed very well. I would go back to have one in the future.\u000a\u000aService - Eh. Although our waitress was nice our drinks took a decade to arrive. Although she said she was "waiting on the bar" a few times to us - I can't imagine what the crap the bar was doing - basically, not making our drinks. It was not busy. \u000a\u000aAmbiance - Again, sewage smell. Also, to begin with we were sat in the front of the restaurant on Fremont street and I wasn't thrilled. With the cars going by it just was not a nice place to dine. The inside was interesting, but the bar looked somewhat small. \u000a\u000aReturn Factor - I am turned off from their food, but I am intrigued with the drink menu and the drinks are what got the extra star for this review, or else it would have been a 2-star. I believe I will be back for drinks and I'll sit at the bar for sure.

VWell this is a place that despite its oddly arranged seating and small space is going to do well at Town Square. I honestly cannot remember what was here before Capriotti's, but can we really remember many of the unmemorable, poorly thought out, and down-right bad places that have opened up at Town Square? The place seems cursed, save for Yard House. BUT I believe Capriotti's WILL survive, if only based on the fact it is a chain that delivers good food and it is a name that will have people flock to it no matter what.\u000a\u000aI happened upon Cap's while I was shopping today and had two things in mind. 1. Getting some food and 2. Escaping the heat. I wandered to Cap's and entered. The place is tiny and cramped. There is bar seating and a few tables. No matter how busy this place gets, it is not going to hold many people, but I've noticed that about a lot of Capriotti's - small places, limited seating.\u000a\u000aI received the Capastrami (Small) and a small fountain drink, which I had to shimmy to the back of the place to fill up. There is room for exactly one person in front of the soda machine so be prepared to wait if the place is busy. \u000a\u000aMy sandwich came out quickly and was delicious as usual. Cap's uses the finest meats and the best ingredients, that's why their sandwiches taste so good (save for a burnt Philly Cheese Steak I had once). \u000a\u000aIf I'm in Town Square and need a quick bite, this will probably now be my go-to. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is again, the tiny space and the necessity to squeeze around people to get to the soda fountain.

VWould not honor my Restaurant.com coupon. Poor customer service. \u000a\u000aI came here with a measly $5 restaurant.com coupon, in order to be redeemed one had to purchase $7.50 worth of food, which shouldn't be a problem because each taco here costs $2+. \u000a\u000aThe girl ringing me up got her (what I assume to be) boss/owner/whatever on the phone and although I can only pick up a few words of Spanish here and there I knew what was going down. After much consternation on her part (and by the cook) they decided they would not honor my coupon. Why? Because, and I quote, "They've been taking money from us.". Whom? Restaurant.com? Well yes, I would assume so because they probably get a cut. I pointed out there's no expiry date, but they were not impressed. I've never had this happen to me before with a Restaurant.com coupon, but I've assumed it could happen.\u000a\u000aHere's the thing though, I've had Restaurant.com coupons expire before. The website alerts you to the fact the owner has stopped accepting the coupons and allows you to exchange your coupon for another. Obviously Taco Tijuana just decided to stop honoring the coupons without telling Restaurant.com, which, in my mind is very bad form. Especially for those that had already purchased the coupon with intention to buy eventually. If it expires, or you don't want people coming in to use it - than just say so, don't leave people out in the lurch.\u000a\u000aAlso - here's another issue, if you have a customer that has a coupon from a reliable source, with no expiry date, shouldn't you just honor the coupon in order to keep a customer and save face? I would. In fact, I know a lot of very good establishments that would. Especially when the price you would be eating was only $10.95 (minus $5) which bring us to a whopping $5.95 they would have had to just let go in order to honor my non-expired coupon. \u000a\u000aThat being said what I ordered and subsequently paid full price for, even though all I really wanted to do was ditch my order and go down the street to Taco y Taco.\u000a\u000a2 Adobada Tacos\u000a2 Lengua Tacos\u000a1 "Especial" Quesadilla\u000a1 Orange Jarittos\u000a\u000aThe adobada tacos were good, but definitely could have used more meat. Spices were on point, but way too much freaking cilantro and onions. Lengua was okay. I've never had it before, so I'd be interested to see what it's like somewhere else before I make my final call on if I actually enjoy eating cow tongue tacos.\u000a\u000aThe especial quesadilla was disappointing. Hardly any cheese at all, and mostly meat. I asked for carne asada in it. The carne asada was really spicy - like everything here. You do not really need any salsas with these tacos because they are pre-seasoned to the spicy side.\u000a\u000aThere is no salsa bar. They grill up onions/peppers for you and you get that with your order\u000a\u000aCustomer Service - 1 Star\u000aFood - 2 Stars\u000aRestaurant/Ambiance - 1 Star\u000a\u000aOverall - I'll be taking my taco business back to Taco y Taco from here on out.

VRequires further inspection...\u000a\u000aCafe Zupas is a hot-spot for lunch. Salads, sandwiches, and soups are the stars of the show. The strangely unsettling amount of customer-service is somewhat of a put-off, but not so much I wouldn't go back. The interior is nice enough with a lot of seating, booths and tables. \u000a\u000aI'm not thoroughly impressed because for one the salad I ordered failed completely on pretty much every level except for that fact that is was HUGE and way too much of it for me to eat in one sitting, especially since I had ordered a salad/soup combo. Combos are the way to go though, soup/salad, salad/sandwich, sandwich/soup, etc. \u000a\u000aSalad: Yucatan Chipotle Chicken Salad - served with a few strips of dried-out chicken breasts, olives, way too many tortilla strips, guacamole (that was spilling over the side of the bowl), a few black beans, a few olives, and a "chipotle" sauce, which did not taste like chipotle and did not add any flavor at all to the salad. Overall this salad is a huge let-down. Try a different salad other than this one.\u000a\u000aLobster Bisque - Decent enough soup, decent enough portion. I finished the soup, mainly because I wasn't thrilled with the salad. They have saltine crackers AND the cute little clam crackers available by the drink station for your soups. I though this soup was all right for the fact its Lobster Bisque at a quick dining spot. Others have complained of it being overly-sweet or not having enough lobster... but c'mon, it's not like you're sitting in a fine-dining establishment on the Strip. For what it is, it's good. I'd order it again.\u000a\u000aPrice-point - About the same as Panera Bread, but you are getting a bit more bang for your buck here in my opinion. A two-item combo and a fountain soda cost me a little over 10 bucks. \u000a\u000aI think I'll try again, solely based off the fact they have a really extensive menu and so many pairing options I am sure I am bound to find something that I really like.

VIt is possible I may have just found my new "go-to" place for drinks and happy hour. I still adore my beloved Vanguard, but since trying out Velveteen Rabbit I will probably have to split my time between the two. The only downfall of Velveteen Rabbit is that is sits on the South side of Charleston, being kind of cut off from the rest of the downtown bars and hangouts on Main Street (mainly Artifice and Bar+Bistro). However, the same can be said about The Lady Sylvia.\u000a\u000aParking - There is a lot to the side of the building which makes parking a snap if there are spots, otherwise you'll have to resort to on-street parking somewhere on main.\u000a\u000aBar Decor/Ambiance - A nice mix of old-timey furniture with flairs for modern lighting and light shows on the wall over the interesting artwork. Menus are boards, drinks are flirty and pretty, chalkboard menus add a clever touch and a way to play with their drink menu.\u000a\u000aDrinks - I had the "Improved Whisky Sour" a very delicious cocktail and a steal at $8. All of their made-to-order cocktails are $8. Less pricey than Commonwealth and Vanguard. And I tried the Blind Willow, also a nice drink. Wine was also had. They serve up some interesting-sounding beers as well. \u000a\u000a+1 - They serve delicious mixed nuts at the bar. We got a blend of the savory and sweet. Perfect pairing with our cocktails. And no, they do not sit out on the bar for everyone's hands to be in, you get your very own bowl. \u000a\u000aOverall - Very impressed. I will be back.

VLet's see... Stopped in for happy hour prior to the Justin Timberlake concert at the Grand Garden. The place wasn't terribly busy. My girlfriends and I took seats at the bar.\u000a\u000aHappy hour drink menu is decent. Cocktails and wine are included, as well as $3 drafts. I selected a drink that is pretty much a Moscow Mule with a fancy-fied name for a gastropub. I got a pinot noir in at the very end of the HH, it was decent, a fairly run of the mill California varietal.\u000a\u000aFood is not included on the HH menu. O well. I was starving. Ordered the Double Dare Dog for $19. *facepalm* Well what can you expect? I shelled out twenty bucks for two hotdogs, wrapped in bacon, topped with guacamole, salsa (pico de galloesque) and Chicharrones. Came with unimpressive Luke warm fries. Hot dog WAS good. Flavors were playful, different. What you would expect from a gastropub. FYI: I had a serious tummy ache later... I think it was just too rich for my system.\u000a\u000aService was laaaah-AME! We were ignored at the bar by the bartender on numerous occasions. My drink sat empty without being asked for a new one. Bartender seemed uninterested... That is until we waved her down. \u000a\u000aAmbiance is.... Fancy sports bar with expensive bar food. You must get ready to break out monies and just not give a crap about the fact you're paying way too much because you're on the Strip and it's Michael Mina.\u000a\u000aChance for return? Highly unlikely but not completely annihilated from my dining options.

VI'm surprised I did not review SkinnyFats the first time I ate here, but apparently I did not. I'm guessing I must have been reserving my rating for another try. I've now been here a total of... twice.\u000a\u000aOn my first run at this place I probably would have given 4-stars, but I'll say my rating is more like a 3, but bordering on 4, if they fix a few issues.\u000a\u000aFirst off the place is small, too small for the amount of traffic it gets. I realize they can't do anything about this, but still. Secondly, I waited for my food FOR-E-VER the last time I was here. Eh, I know these can be day-to-day issues, I'm not docking them for it, it's just me being a whiny patron.\u000a\u000aHere's the real deal - I ordered a Cranburkey with a side salad. The salad came out with the ranch cup tipped all over my salad. Presentation not so great. Salad - good. Next came the Cranburkey. Presentation - terrible. I'm used to following SkinnyFats on Instagram and their pictures of their food looks SO GOOD, and so nicely plated. So, I was disappointed. I thought, the taste will make up for it!\u000a\u000aThe Cranburkey had a dry bun. The turkey was cooked well enough - but kind of bland. The cranberry-type gravy was all right, but not enough to have me desiring it again. The arugula-mix on the burger was wilted, and not terribly fresh. I picked a bunch of it out. Overall - an OK meal, therefore my rating is "A-OK". \u000a\u000aNot sure I'll be back. It's kind of out of the way from where I live and where I work. We'll see.

VHmmm. Hmmm? Hmmm.\u000a\u000aThat's what I kept thinking as I ate my Kuma ninja (ginormous) sized snow cream. I had never had it before and now in the aftermath I am still a little unsure of this dessert item.\u000a\u000aAfter attending K-Pop goes the Yelper, my friends and I decided we had to check out this new craze of fluff ice, snow ice, snow cream? Anyway, whatever the name we ventured to Spring Mountain behind the Starbucks and found this KAWAII place nestled in the back of a shopping center. It's brightly lit, and colorful. Everything looks super CLEAN. There are few tables though, so I imagine when the place is packed there is nowhere to sit. \u000a\u000aBasically it is kind of like a froyo place, you can choose from pre-made combos or you can make your own concoction by choosing a snow cream, two toppings, and a sauce. I decided I liked the sound of the Bruce Tea, but I did not want red beans and wanted to replace them with rainbow mochi. The girl said that was fine, but they were out of the popping pearl - d'oh. So I ended up basically not having the Bruce Tea at all, instead I made my own combo - Green Tea snow cream, rainbow mochi, strawberries, and condensed milk. \u000a\u000aAs I received my snow cream I knew I would not eat all of it, so that kind of disappointed me. I wish they had a smaller size because I cannot eat that much, especially since I had previously eaten dinner. But I set about eating my snow cream. I liked the mochi, it was soft, but I got tired of it after awhile and pushed it aside. The strawberries were very frozen, and the condensed milk gave everything a nice flavor. As for the snow cream - I'm not sure how I feel about it. It did not have a good "mouth feel". I know that sounds weird - but it was like a cross between ice cream and just shaved ice. It was kind of how ice cream gets if it get freezer burn. I was hoping it would be more.... fluffy? More air-like? But mostly I just noticed it was like flavored ice crystals in my mouth. Not to mention it began melting into a goop when I got toward the end of my bowl. I had to toss a big portion of it.\u000a\u000aWould I try again? Not sure. I think I want to venture out and try a different snow cream place to compare and contrast. Maybe I will go back to Kuma once they have been operating for a bit longer.

VI've now been to Pizza Rock twice. First things first, why not 5 stars? Basically because I've been here twice and I have never been told that locals receive 20% off their bill. What the heck Pizza Rock? I don't typically go around asking, Hey can I get a local discount? But. When I've been here twice and sung its praises to people - and yet, I've been able to get 20% off but haven't? Arg. That ruffles my feathers.\u000a\u000aOn to what is GOOD. Happy hour is awesome. Personal pizzas, apps, well drinks, and cocktails all on the cheap. My friends and I came here during HH and split all three of the personal pizzas and shared the meatballs. Okay. I'm no meatball expert but I think these are delicious. Meaty, not bready, and the sauce it comes with compliments very well. I also like that these meatballs are simple. I've had way too many meatballs that have way too much going on with them. Another reason I like them: you can cut them down the middle with your fork and they fall away in two pieces, not a bunch of lumpy, gross meat pieces. Quality. I think.\u000a\u000aOther than HH.... I came here with my hubby on a Saturday night. Luckily they have plenty of 2-top tables so we were seated quickly. Service was quick and to the point. Our server neither impressed me or upset me so I'll give a neutral rating for service.\u000a\u000aWhat we ordered... The New Yorker 23. It was the one pizza on the menu I figured my picky (and rather plain-Jane) husband would enjoy. The New Yorker comes with: Sliced Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce, Sliced House Link Sausage, Garlic, Pepperoni, Ricotta. I asked for the link sausages to be removed and replaced with mushrooms. They were happy to oblige. Under the menu it says, "Winner, Best Traditional, Las Vegas". I'm not sure what that means.\u000a\u000aOverall thoughts on the pizza... I enjoyed it. I love the thin crust style. The mix of cheese and sauce was perfect. Pepperoni... Okay. The Ricotta cheese was an awesome addition, creamy and slightly sweet offsetting the heartiness of the pepperoni and garlic. The flavors were that of a "normal" pizza, but with a refinement. I think this was a perfect way to satisfy my more adventurous side and my husband's more traditional side.\u000a\u000aFinal decision: Mine and my husband's dinner was a bit pricey. Although delicious, I would rather go back for the happy hour. HH is your best bet here. And ya, go ahead and throw in the fact you're a local. You'll probably get a discount, unlike me. I'd also be interested in just heading up to the take out window to take a slice to go.\u000a\u000aOther things I want to go back for:\u000a\u000aTheir Margherita (only 73 made per day)\u000aClam and Garlic Pizza\u000aLa Regina (The Gold Cup Winner)\u000aQuail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale Pizza\u000aCal Italia (again, this comes as one of the Personal Pizzas on HH menu and is a FoodNetwork winner)\u000aThe Chorizo Mussels (App)\u000aAnd I would come back again for the meatballs.\u000a\u000aLooks, like I'll be making a few return trips. The great thing is, I am so happy there is a good, inventive pizza place so close to where I live now.

VAll right. But kind of pricey for a crepe.\u000a\u000aI've walked past The Crepe numerous times, but decided to give it a shot for a dessert option after dinner with a friend. The restaurant is located in the Market Place of Tivoli Village. It really reminds me of a beatnik coffee shop, complete with people painting and live music (at least on the night I was there).\u000a\u000aThe menu is comprised of sweet and savory options. Honestly, the menu was much more diverse and had more selection than I thought it would. Crepes are represented by country, so I had The Venezia ($10.90), which was an indulgent crepe with cannoli cream, black and white chocolate drizzles and chips, and a dollop of whipped cream. \u000a\u000aIt was a yummy crepe and nice for dessert. However, the pricing is putting me off from returning. Perhaps if I'm in the area I may try a "savory" crepe next time. \u000a\u000aOverall, it is a fun-styled establishment that makes over-priced crepes.

VPlease go to this coffee shop. You will not regret it. If this coffee shop were near my home I would be here all the time for their hazelnut cafe latte because it was the best hazelnut latte I have ever had hands down. I mean, what is there to a hazelnut latte really? BUT. Avery's is kllin' it!\u000a\u000aMy friend and I stopped here after lunch to grab some liquid energy for the rest of our day. It is a pleasant little spot with congenial owners working the register and doubling up as the barista of the day. Service was paramount with suggestions and they happily accepted my Yelp deal that is being offered when you check in.\u000a\u000aI wish so much this cafe was on my side of town. They would get ALL my coffee-needed business!

VNice little place in The Ogden. Rustic-looking interior goes with the entire nature-goodness/organic/gluten-free mantra of the restaurant itself. I have no need to eat gluten free and I'll be the first person to say, hey, sometimes I eat Taco Bell, so obviously I am not a food purist. However - WILD lives up to expectations as to what it is and how its food should  taste - an all natural, pleasantly surprising experience awaits you.\u005c\u000a\u000aThe menu boasts flat-bread pizzas for the most part, but I was not interested in those. Instead I opted for their delicious (not to mention picturesque) bruschetta. Topped with usual suspects of tomatoes (yellow and red), basil, mint, mozzarella, sunflower seeds, and a balsamic. All together presents a sweet and spiced-up medley of flavors.\u000a\u000aI also enjoyed their tomato soup. I creamy-grainy rendition which packs quite a punch of flavor in every bite.\u000a\u000aLastly, I ended with a slice of apple pie, which I hate to say, was pretty dang bad. Very dry and flavorless. I suspect this may be from the gluten-free and less-sugary ingredients that went in the pie to make it natural and gluten free. It was really lacking that sumptuous apple-pie flavor and texture I am so used to.\u000a\u000aBesides the dessert, my experience was great. Service was good and food, although on the pricey side, lives up to the standards the restaurant boasts.

VI have to admit I am quite impressed with the Mac Shack. I've seen this place numerous times on shopping trips to the area around Boca Park, but I never stopped in until this past weekend with my husband.\u000a\u000aKnowing we were both hungry I knew I had to make a decision that would please both of us. Considering my husband isn't as outlandish with his food choices as myself I decided on Mac Shack. After all, pasta is something we both love.\u000a\u000aWe arrived during lunch so we took advantage of their lunch special. $7.99 for a make your own bowl of pasta, a choice of a side salad or bowl of soup, a breadstick and a drink. I think that's a really good value, especially considering the amount of food you get.\u000a\u000aI got: whole grain wheat penne pasta, with spicy red sauce, chicken, and an extra add in of roasted garlic (I think that cost me an extra 50 cents), and the side garden salad. My husband got angel hair pasta, with Alfredo sauce, chicken, and the corn chowder soup.\u000a\u000aThe place is very roomy with black/metallic decorations and they play some interesting music over the speakers. As for the food it quickly arrived at our table. My pasta was cooked perfectly, the spicy red sauce had a nice kick with peppers and onions, the chicken was perfectly fine, and a decent amount. Roasted garlic was good, but sooo much I ended up leaving quite a bit of it in my bowl. The salad was decent, and a large portion. You will not leave here unfulfilled. Neither my husband or myself could finish our entire meal.\u000a\u000aI would absolutely return... although not too often. I am a pasta fanatic, but I gotta watch those carbs! Good thing this place is not anywhere near where I live or I think I'd be gaining a few extra pounds....

VThe music is too loud.\u000a\u000aSorry, had to get that out of the way. I've been to MTO twice during my lunch breaks from work since it is so nicely close to my place of employment. It is certainly a nice place, with a vibrant color scheme and fun TV screens that display cute sayings and funny pictures. \u000a\u000aFood is scrumptious and varies between fatty and healthy. You can find a mix of ingredients, interesting and quirky, while also on the menu, you have traditional items to please the crowds. \u000a\u000aLast time I was here I had the FAT ELVIS. I couldn't help myself, french toast with bacon, strawberries, blueberries, bananas, peanut butter, and nutella, served with maple syrup. COME ON, even if you don't want it, you have to be interested, right? It was a heaping portion, for $13 and I only ate half. The mix of flavors is decent, french toast was done right, fluffy, not mushy, nice char on the bread, but not over-powering. Bread used it perfect, big and much like Texas toast style. Fruits were fresh and helpful since the meal is so very filling. Peanut-butter and Nutella flavors go well with the banana, but not so much the bacon in my opinion. I would opt to have the bacon on the side. \u000a\u000aI've also had the Hen House wrap here, and I believe it's better than the Fat Elvis. Wrap was not mushy or dry. Lettuce was crispy and fresh. Chicken was grilled well and honestly, probably one of the better wraps I've had in my existence of eating wraps. And I don't regularly consume them. Coffee is also good and comes in a nice, large cup.\u000a\u000aBonus - they have PINK lemonade on their menu. Yes, I ordered it. Yes, it was good. \u000a\u000aOverall return factor very likely. Recommended for breakfast and lunch.

VI've seen great reviews for Kailyn's Kitchen on Yelp and I came across a restaraunt.com gift certificate for them - so, put these two together and you get - a really great meal on the cheap!\u000a\u000aThe place is called "Kailyn's Diner" inside the restaurant. It has the feel of a diner. There is minimal seating. I have heard the place really gets busy on Saturday and Sunday mornings. When my husband and I were there, it was just us and a few patrons sitting at the bar.\u000a\u000aThe service is down-home feel. The waitress was very nice, the owner/chef asked us how our food was. It is like eating in a small cafe, in a small town, except, you're in Las Vegas on the East Side in a not-so-great shopping center. \u000a\u000aBUT - the burger. OMG the Seoul Burger! "Korean barbecue glazed patty topped with mushrooms and smoked Gouda cheese, and kimchee mayo". This burger was perfectly done - sauce was tangy, mayo was creamy and spicy, comes with lettuce, tomato, and red onion - on a beautiful Brioche bun! Also comes with your choice of fries, garlic fries, or homemade chips. I got the garlic fries - delish! \u000a\u000aHusband had the pancake platter, which is a little lacking. It only comes with one pancake and one slice of bacon with a small side of eggs. My hubby ordered another pancake for extra.\u000a\u000aI also had a house salad to start, which was OK. One thing I can say is they included mushrooms in my salad which I LOVE because I always add mushrooms to my salad at home, but it's a rare sight to see in restaurants.\u000a\u000aWe ended the meal with the craziest dessert - Bacon covered in cookie dough and deep fried, sprinkled with powdered sugar. It was OK. My husband did not like it at all so I ate all three. (Fatty fat fat...)\u000a\u000aBUT - THE BURGER, OMG THE BURGER!

VI hate to do it, but I have to.\u000a\u000aEnter myself and two co-workers. We work close to Downtown and we stopped in at Stewart & Ogden for lunch. We were on the clock so we hoped service would be quick and there wouldn't be too many people. Luckily we came at a good time because there weren't many people there.\u000a\u000aOrdered:\u000aAhi Tuna Sliders with Tater Tots: Grandly awful. The bread, although looking pretty was dry as a bone and tasteless. It was like cardboard. The teeny pieces of ahi tuna were so freaking salty I could barely stomach them. The slaw inside was unmemorable. The tots, while brought out warm and crispy were also REALLY SALTY. Just an overall failure of what could be a really great dish. They should take a moment and go have the Ahi Tuna Sandwich at Yard House to understand what these sliders should really taste like.\u000a\u000aTomato Bisque (by both my co-workers): They said it was good, and the presentation was really cute with little goldfish crackers.\u000a\u000aSide of Fries: Salty. TOO SALTY.\u000a\u000aCaeser Salad with added on Chicken: The salad looked blah. My co-worker had to ask for extra dressing, because although it was mixed in, there wasn't much. The chicken was dry and she said the Romano cheese had melted under the heat of the chicken. They didn't even bother to give the chicken time to cool a bit before throwing it on her salad.\u000a\u000aDecor is odd. The yellow IKEA like chairs really throw me. They should be replaced to go with the rest of the restaurant which is like, "chic diner".\u000a\u000aThe problem is in the kitchen though. Honestly I would have sent my food back had I not been limited with time and on the clock for work. The food is simply not good. I really doubt I'll be back, but I'll keep an eye on the Yelp reviews to see if they improve any.

VAn excellent choice for quick traditional Mexican in a relaxed "cantina" atmosphere.\u000a\u000aViva Mercado's used to be open on Rainbow, but has moved to the shopping center where 808 Tapas, Bachi Burger, and Buldogis is located. It is actually deeper into the shopping center located next to a coffee shop and a few boutique clothing stores.\u000a\u000aI dined here with a co-worker during a slow afternoon around 2 PM. \u000a\u000aChips are served to each table with salsa AND bean dip, yum! Choices my friends, I love choices. As for my meal, I selected the chicken burrito that comes with rice, beans, and pico de gallo. My co-worker was paying for the meal, so I didn't want to get too spendy. He ordered the carne asada torta, which looked great and he said was awesome.\u000a\u000aMy chicken burrito was excellent with moist chicken inside and a red sauce on top with melted cheese. What I really enjoyed about it was that it was not MASSIVELY HUGE. Nor was the amount of beans and rice on my plate. I think in a time when people are just eating way too much food I applaud restaurants that are willing to NOT slop massive amounts of side dishes on plates OR create such huge burritos no one in their right mind would sit at a table at eat it all at once.\u000a\u000aService was a bit slow. Our drinks were refilled, but we waited quite awhile for the check. Our server disappeared from the restaurant floor for about 10-12 minutes and we had to wave down the busser to get him to come out and bring our check.\u000a\u000aOverall if I were in the area again and wanted Mexican I would definitely come back.

VConsidering it is a "one of a kind" attraction in the area I'm willing to say, yes, I am a fan of Container Park.\u000a\u000aWith its artwork and fire-breathing grasshopper-thing there is no shortage of areas to grab a cute pic, or take a selfie. Both times I've been here there have been children and adults alike enjoying the space. Strangely enough, the children/adult vibe here works and causes me no irritation.\u000a\u000aI've tried Pinches and SweetSpot here and I am looking forward to trying a few more places and exploring further. \u000a\u000aIt's worth the trip to see it - even if you only do it once.\u000a\u000aBig con - parking is horrific. Ever since the Downtown Project started El Cortez has stopped allowing people to patron their parking garages for free. *womp womp* So be prepared for street parking and metering.

VA Friday afternoon lunch by myself away from work landed me at Pinches.\u000a\u000aI had heard and read the upheaval regarding the name of this establishment and needed to stop by at least once to see it in person. It is in the Container Park, which was nice enough, but considering I was on a lunch break and I just wanted to eat I was pleased to see there was not much of a line outside PInches (which, by the way - does not have its actual NAME on the restaurant).\u000a\u000aThe place is cramped, to put it lightly. However, the menu board is bright with neon colors chalked on. Select from tacos (of course), burritos, and even Mexican breakfast items. I will be back for you chilaquiles.\u000a\u000aYou walk up the line and finally get to the cash register and are unceremoniously cramped against people attempting to get to the ONLY soda fountain in the entire place. The place is just entirely too small. But, I ordered an al pastor burrito, with no cilantro, and a small drink, made my way out of the cluster-F of people and sat at one of the two tables they have to the side inside the restaurant. \u000a\u000aAl pastor burrito - comes with meat, beans, salsa, and rice. Meat was not super tasty the way al pastor should be. I was disappointed. Taco y Taco has better al pastor by a long shot. However, burrito was nicely done, ingredients dispersed. You get what you get - and guess what? This place is in a touristy destination, it's a tiny place, and you can't see the meat they're using rotating beautifully, being sliced before your eyes. So - there ya go. \u000a\u000aIt is not bad, nor is it great. There are plenty of places around town you can get AMAZING food like this (and probably for less). I would suggest one of the many places on Charleston Blvd.\u000a\u000aAnyway, I'll probably be back during another of my lunch breaks for the chilaquiles. If those are any good, the review may change.

VAlthough this place is as small as a closet you will be missing out on something really good if you don't stop by. Located in the Downtown Container Park, this particular establishment will hopefully do really well and relocate to a bigger spot in the future.\u000a\u000aOfferings include fruity concoctions such as fruit teas, fruit slushes, gelatos, boba/bubble teas, sorbettos, and much more! On my first trip here I ordered two drinks: one Thai iced tea with boba at a sweetness level of 3 (out of 5). This made the drink a perfect mix of tea flavor and sweet. The amount of boba was plentiful, and the serving is relative to the price.\u000a\u000aI also ordered a simple strawberry iced tea, which I drank later and it was refreshing. Not too sweet, but had a very distinct flavor of all-natural strawberry (not artificial flavoring).\u000a\u000aThe only downside to ChillSpot is its very small and cramped. I would not want to be here when there were a lot of people placing orders. Also - the menu is electronic and rotates between screens. I didn't realize this until I was waiting for my already-ordered drink and saw they made slushes, which I would have rather tried over the iced tea. \u000a\u000aPS - Word is they make deserts infused with nitrogen and halo-halos. I will have to come back for one of these...

VPunk Rock Bowling could have been so much better...\u000a\u000aThe only reason I am giving this event a 3-star rating is because of their poor, sad excuse for a will-call line outside of the El Cortez in which I stood for 2+ hours on Friday night. Whoever decided letting in 15-ish people at a time into the Cortez to retrieve tickets must have been on acid. Also, the three or so girls working the tickets was insane. Four people to give out tickets to a show that spans an entire weekend?\u000a\u000aLook, I'll be honest I stood outside for 2 hours and still did not have my two tickets to the ONE show I wanted to see (which by the way had already opened its doors that night). I got so frustrated I walked down to the venue and asked if it was really necessary I have my tickets to get into the show. I did have my email printed out stating I had paid for the tickets. They said I absolutely had to have the tickets to get in. GREAT! I returned back to the Cortez and basically walked in and non-nonchalantly stood in line behind the people who had been ushered in from outside by the seedy rent-a-cops policing the event.\u000a\u000aI got my tickets and ended up seeing the show I had been looking forward to for some time. Azul Tequila had a good venue, and even with the clusterf!ck way of getting tickets everyone was in good spirits once actually getting into the show. Luckily punks tend to let things slide and then have a good time. I did the same.\u000a\u000aBut PLEASE PRB - get your act together about the ticketing system next year! I think the downtown location is great and it should stay there, but a new ticketing system must be put in place.

VYES! Thank you PRB for changing your ticketing system. This year was so much better. No lines, no craziness, no anger.\u000a\u000aI only attended Day 2 of PRB and I am not attending any of the after parties this year, much to my dismay. But starting a new job kind of has me in lock down with what I can and cannot do regarding my free time. Therefore, Day 2 (Sunday) of PBR 2012 was my day.\u000a\u000aFirst off I think the space was just about big enough for the crowd, but it could have been a bit bigger. The bleachers in the back were nice to be able to sit when I got tired of standing. Loved the vendors - also loved the food trucks that were there as well! Very cool.\u000a\u000aBand line up was great. I got there exactly at 3:30 PM and watched everything through until 9 PM. Unfortunately I needed to leave due to time restrictions regarding my job. So I actually missed Rancid, the headliner. Not too big of deal for me because I've seen them before and my main concern was seeing The Street Dogs. So - I did get to see The Street Dogs and they played an awesome set.\u000a\u000aThe only things I can say need improvement: better signage. My friend and I walked all around trying to find the entrance. Had there been better signage we wouldn't have been so lost. Also, signage to get OUT. We couldn't find the exit, so we had to ask Metro. Albeit, we did leave early... but still. Also - I felt as though Hepcat was kind of an odd throw-in to the mix of bands. I don't dislike Hepcat, but I just didn't think their performance went well with the flow. \u000a\u000aOverall - VAST improvement over last year which is why I am awarding the 5 stars even though I felt as though there is still some improvement to be made.

VThree years in a row!\u000a\u000aI attended the Saturday portion of PRB 2013, Devo was headlining, but there were also great long-time punk favorites: The Weirdos and The Damned, as well as bunch of other bands. Although I wasn't there from beginning to end, the part the show I did see was awesome. \u000a\u000aThe festival has certainly grown. Since it has taken over the vacant lot Downtown where it was held last year as well, the area of the festival has expanded. There were more vendors and more places to eat, food trucks for the most part. There were a couple places to alcohol/beer and one large beer garden. The beer garden was great because it provided shade, and they had fans/misters. They provided a lot more seating options with picnic tables outside the beer garden.\u000a\u000aThere was still stadium seating available and what looked to be maybe a VIP section. \u000a\u000aMy friend and I did wait in a LONG line to get in, but it seemed to move fairly quickly. It would be helpful for them to put up signs that they need a "BOY" and a "GIRL" line to make the line move quicker in the future. That kind of seemed to be the hold up because the crowd was unaware that we needed to separate genders to be frisked and have our bags checked up until the very beginning of the line. If there were two lines to begin with, it would go faster.\u000a\u000aMinus the standing in line the concert was awesome. Of course PRB is full of many other events like the actual bowling and the after-shows that happen in many of the bars Downtown. Overall I enjoyed my experience. Oh and the fact that the ticket was available to be printed online is a big plus (there were issues with ticketing in the past).
