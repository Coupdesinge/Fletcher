VWow, what a disappointment!  I was not impressed with this place.  It was the night of the NCAA BB Finals and the front bar was too packed.  We went to the the back room and small patio area to join some friends who were part of a large party.  \u000a\u000aThere was hardly any room back there either and the server ignored us for most of the night.  We had to serve ourselves by going into the bar.  We also had to bus our own tables because nobody came out to clean up.  Also, the back room was very muggy and humid....this can't be the first time they've done large parties, right?!\u000a\u000aLike I said, I expected more out of this place and left disappointed.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 10%

VUpgrading this place 1 Star.  Over the past couple of years, we've dropped by here after a game (Suns/Dbacks/Rattlers).  It's a fun place to come and hangout and have a nightcap.\u000a\u000aAfter Rattlers games, the team will come and party with the fans in the back room.  Those guys are super cool and the atmosphere is fun.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 75%

VLive 101.5 or is it 101.5 JAMZ?  I think it just changed names...but the music has been the same for the past few years since I moved to town.  It's a Top 40 station and I listen to it from time to time.  Some of my friends like listening to Lady La.  I personally don't care for on-air personalities, so I change the station when they come on.  I've been to some remotes though and she's pretty cool in person.\u000a\u000aThey play all of the new top songs and it can get repetitive and predictable, but it's nice to listen it from time to time.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 75%

VI've been to several events/conferences at the Phoenix Convention Center.  The facility is nice and modern with spacious pre-function areas and a nice selection of food options.  There's a Crust Pizza that serves up Pastas and Pizza for quick eats.  That's my favorite outlet to grab lunch or a snack if I don't like what the conference meal program offers.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/phoenix-convention-center-phoenix?select=8z7f14l2NjninBjZ-R7Tpw#8z7f14l2NjninBjZ-R7Tpw\u000a\u000aThe worst part about attending an event here is the parking.  Your choices are underground self parking garages that range from $6-$12 per day.or if the conference/event pays for a valet service, you might have that option for a fee.  There's also parking at area hotels that costs $ too and can be quite a walk. \u000a\u000aOnce you get inside it's easy to get turned around trying to figure out what side of the building you're on.  The directional signage is not very good.  It takes me a couple of days to get oriented when attending a large conference here.\u000a\u000aOverall, the experience is pretty average for a convention center.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

VI've driven past this place many times on the way to Suns or D-Backs games.  Every time I passed by, it looked like a fun place to go hang out.  I finally had the opportunity to do so during a conference in downtown Phoenix.  One of the companies at the conference hosted a party here.\u000a\u000aThe party was staged in the patio area as you enter the restaurant.  The company who hosted the party was giving away complimentary Cigars, so I understand why they had it outdoors.  The weather was perfect, so it was a good time of the year to do it.  The place was packed too.  So why the 2 Stars?  Here's why:\u000a\u000a- They serve Wine out of a liquor gun....yes, they do.  When I went up to the bar on the patio and asked for a glass of Cabernet, the bartender told me "You have to go inside because we don't have the handles with the Wine".....I thought she was kidding and I said, "I'm sorry, I don't think you understand, I asked for a glass of Cabernet.  You don't have any bottles back there?"....that's when she confirmed what I heard and said "No, you heard me right, we serve Wine out of a handle/line and since we're a smaller bar outside you have to go inside to get it".......what the hell?!  The Wine tasted like what you would expect Wine from a tap to taste like...\u000a\u000a- The restrooms are like gas station restrooms.  They're located out next to the bars on the patio and they are just like gas station restrooms in that they're too small and dirty.  They couldn't handle the crowd of people at the party.\u000a\u000a- Service is slow.  The line at the bar was 30 people deep for each line (2 lines).  There were only 2 bartenders to service 200+ people.  It took 20+ min to get a drink.\u000a\u000a- The party felt like a house party in someone's backyard.  Plastic cups, plastic furniture, you had to bus your own table.....there were no buspersons or anyone to clean up.  Bizzaro-world.....\u000a\u000aOverall, not a good experience.  Maybe if I was a young 20 yr old it would be cool...not now.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 5%

This arena is a great place to watch these events.\u000a\u000aThey have Cold Stone &  Streets of NY Pizza in the concession stands.  The parking is easy in/out when you park in any of the parking garages surrounding the arena.  After the event, you can go to one of many bars in the surrounding area.

VWe came here last month to watch a boxing event.  The theatre is perfect for that type of event.  The stage is set in the round, so the stage is front and center.  However, the place is old and is in desperate need of a renovation.  The bar and bathrooms are located downstairs underneath the seating area and is very small.  It's a little inconvenient.\u000a\u000aThe food and drink options here are very limited as well....think cheap high school gymnasium type of deal.  Also, I wouldn't trust parking my car out in the lot during a show...the neighborhood is bad and sketchy.  The night we went we took an Execucar to/from the place....we didn't want to risk it.\u000a\u000aI would only come back to see a show that I don't want to miss...otherwise, I'd pass.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 30%

VUMOM helps homeless families in need.  Their shelter provides a safe place for them to  stay and work on finding permanent housing.  They also help domestic violence victims find shelter as well.\u000a\u000aUntil I moved to Scottsdale and heard a presentation from them, I had never heard of this charity.  It really touched me to hear the stories and they invited me to come visit the facility.  After seeing what they do first hand, I knew I had to get involved somehow....so we donated some blankets and furniture as well as gave some monetary support.\u000a\u000aI am all about helping charities that put your donations to good use and this is one of those who are making an immediate impact on the community.  Kudos to the volunteers who work at their facility and help these families in need!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VBeing on a No Meat Diet makes you think outside the box sometimes when your accustomed to being an omnivore.....so, when we were looking around for a place to grab some lunch a friend suggested we stop by Sweet Tomatoes.  It has been over 10 yrs since I've been to one, so I thought why not.\u000a\u000aWe arrived just before the lunch rush at 11:30 am.  There was a short line, but nothing crazy.

I went back to grab a small bowl of Mac n Cheese too, which was ok.\u000a\u000aI had a coupon for 2 for $9.99, so it was a great deal.

VOne of my colleagues is a member here.  Since we just got out of a meeting downtown, we decided to grab lunch here.  I am very impressed with this place.  The building is old, but it has been well kept.\u000a\u000aPictures of past golf tournaments and celebrities line the hallways.  Dark, high quality wood is used for the trim and finishes.  When I think "country club", this is what I imagine.  \u000a\u000aWe went upstairs to the dining room and sat down for lunch.  The server was very friendly and went over the menu & specials.  One of the specials caught my attention, an Italian Panini w/Fries, so I ordered it.\u000a\u000aIt was a few minutes after noon and the place started to get busy for lunch.  Many businessmen from the area were having lunch as well as a few retirees and a couple of golfers.  It was a nice mix of people and the vibe was very cool.\u000a\u000aIt didn't take very long for our food to come out.  The Italian Panini was awesome, full of flavor and the ingredients was fresh and high quality.  Nice sized portion too....actually, it was large for a Panini.  I was stuffed after this meal.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a great experience.  If it wasn't so far away from home, I'd seriously consider purchasing a membership here.  Can't wait to come back and play some golf!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VWe were invited to attend a Wine Tasting special event hosted by one of my clients.  In the 2 yrs since we've lived here, we haven't been to the Wrigley Mansion, so we were very excited to come check it out. \u000a\u000aWhen you pull up to the mansion, it's a bit confusing to figure out where to drive....there's a self-parking lot at the bottom of the hill....walk up a large hill in 90+ degree weather, um....no thanks.  Ok, so we drove up the driveway assuming that's where the valet parking would be located....and it was.  \u000a\u000aBeautiful views from the top of the hill.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-wrigley-mansion-club-phoenix?select=v_KnIKFpeibBVvefO6ujPA#v_KnIKFpeibBVvefO6ujPA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-wrigley-mansion-club-phoenix?select=7qDCP4mv_Ws2sdJtqmlvOA#7qDCP4mv_Ws2sdJtqmlvOA\u000a\u000aWe walked inside the mansion and were greeted by a hostess who directed us to the private event area to the left.  We enjoyed Wine and Cheese/Crackers/Fruit, etc that you normally find at a Wine tasting.  The Wine was very good and the room was comfortable.  After 30 min or so we were asked to move into the dining room area where we would start a formal Wine tasting with 8 glasses (4 White, 4 Red) of Wine.\u000a\u000aThe sommelier did a nice presentation about each Wine....however, she took too long and was a bit too in-depth for this group of people.  There were over 80 people and many of them were not Wine enthusiasts, so they were bored very quickly.....too much time between sips.  I personally enjoyed it, but afterward many people said it was too much info for them. \u000a\u000aSince the building is very old, the room we were in was not well insulated and got a little stuffy/warm....so if you're coming here during the Summer months, dress light.\u000a\u000aAfter the event, we wandered around the mansion and took a bunch of pics of the artwork and rooms.  I'm sure there's a story behind all of this, but we were on our own and didn't have a guide to explain anything to us.\u000a\u000aWe picked up a flyer for a social club you can belong to here...?  Not really sure what that entails, but it's available.\u000a\u000aOverall, I'd rate this experience 3.5 Stars, but I'm rounding up for the views and Wine.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VI was lucky enough to play in an exclusive charity tournament last month at the Links Course here.  The course is old with many large trees that winds through the Biltmore neighborhood.  Because of it's age, the trees are large and come into play on many holes.  That's what makes it fun.\u000a\u000aThe front 9 of the Links course is very flat, while the back 9 runs through the rolling hills and offers great views of Camelback Mtn and other area landmarks.  The 15th hole is a Par 3 that has a great view from the elevated tee.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arizona-biltmore-golf-courses-phoenix?select=RmvjTxU1tFBH1y780Zgf6g#RmvjTxU1tFBH1y780Zgf6g\u000a\u000aThe biggest downside to this place is the age of it's facilities.  The clubhouse is old and very small.  So is the pro-shop.  The parking lot is tiny too.  Because of these limitations, the post-tournament activities are staged outside...which isn't too great when you've been playing in the hot sun all day....I'd rather be inside a cool, air-conditioned building than out in a sweltering hot tent.\u000a\u000aOverall, the event and day of golf was fun and for a good cause.  I think if they invested some money on course updates and new facilities, it could be a 5 Star course.  For now, it gets 4 Stars from me.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VBased on a recommendation from a friend, we've dined here a few times.  This Italian joint reminds me of the Peppermill Restaurant in Vegas.  The dining room walls are covered in mirrors and the furniture is black and white.  It's dimly lit and has an intimate feel to it.  During our visits, we've had the following menu items:\u000a\u000aEscargots, $11.50\u000a\u000aMozzarella Caprese, $12.00\u000a\u000aSpaghetti w/Meatballs & Sausage, $19.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-restaurant-of-distinction-phoenix?select=g6rybW0TkoO10ItXCbJDyg#g6rybW0TkoO10ItXCbJDyg\u000a\u000aTortellini, Lasagna, Gnocchi (custom made sampler appetizer)\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-restaurant-of-distinction-phoenix?select=OnKBcxrDWW269Z9ZAQ0hRg#OnKBcxrDWW269Z9ZAQ0hRg\u000a\u000aTiramisu\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-restaurant-of-distinction-phoenix?select=BzrmZfblwrBYIB0-5JpAKw#BzrmZfblwrBYIB0-5JpAKw\u000a\u000aThe best part about our experience here is the service.  On one of our visits, when we asked the server if they had Gnocchi, he said "We don't have it as a separate dish, but we can make something for you".  The Better Half ordered a plate for dinner that evening.  On another visit, the server noticed that I was on the fence between the Lasagna, Gnocchi, and Tortellini....so he brought out a small sampler plate for me so I could try all 3 before I made my decision....awesome!\u000a\u000aAs far as the food, it's pretty good.  My fav's are the Gnocchi, Tortellini, and the Spaghetti.  You can't go wrong with any of them.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 87%

VAn older course with large trees, this is a fun track to play.  The layout is pretty flat, you won't have to worry about driving over large ravines or having a long enough drive to clear problem areas.  The course is well kept and the facility is nice.  The outdoor patio is an excellent place to grab a drink and some food before/after your round.  The guest locker room and bathroom is pretty nice and more spacious than I expected.\u000a\u000aThe golf course winds through old houses in Arcadia.  You'll see some nice, new homes and some that haven't been remodeled in many years.  Either way, I wouldn't mind owning one. As is the case with most country clubs, it's a laid back atmosphere with plenty of time between foursomes to enjoy your round.\u000a\u000aThe greens are maintained well, but are not too fast.  For an older course, there are plenty of fairway bunkers, but not too many water hazards....just enough to keep you on your toes.  Overall, it's a fun course.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arizona-country-club-phoenix?select=R5zU7lZQf5ZdCbNqPW3eXA#xVvgEM-Q2OHt_WZHrFj90Q\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VTucked away inside the Royal Palms Resort, this restaurant is a favorite place of mine for lunch.  I meet clients here often because it offers a high quality experience in an upscale setting, perfect for getting business done.\u000a\u000aI usually valet park at the front drive and it's a short walk to the restaurant.  My go to item on the lunch menu is the T-Cook's Burger, $14.  The Burger is tasty and filling....large portion.  Most impressive though is the service.  They really take good care of you here....lunch service feels like dinner service, top notch.\u000a\u000aAs long as my clients continue to enjoy this place, I will keep coming back.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VThis place is gorgeous.  I haven't stayed in the rooms, but have dined in T. Cooks many times and have attended several functions in the banquet rooms.  It's always a great experience.\u000a\u000aFrom the moment you arrive at Valet to the end of your event, the customer service here is awesome.  The banquet staff always goes over and above to make sure you're well taken care of.  At one particular breakfast meeting there wasn't any ice water available in the pre-breakfast area.  Instead of telling me "there's water inside", they went in and got a fresh glass for me.  At another meeting, I asked for a Lime for a Diet Coke I was drinking....they walked to the bar inside the building to slice up a fresh Lime for me, very cool.\u000a\u000aWhenever there's an event here, we try our best to attend because we know it will be over the top.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VWhen co-workers suggested that we meet here for Coffee one morning, I thought they were nuts.  Coffee at a grocery store?  Well, I guess judging by the long lines of people, it's a very popular joint.  We ordered some Coffee, Muffins, and some other sweet stuff (I don't know what it was, they ordered it).\u000a\u000aI had a Blueberry Muffin, which was awesome.  The Coffee was some kind of Organic Ethiopian blend...it had a distinct, sharp flavor to it and was pretty strong, but very good.\u000a\u000aThe store part of the place was very busy and so was the dining/sitting area.  We sat in a large booth which was comfortable for 4 of us.\u000a\u000aThe absolute worse part of visiting this place is the parking.  The parking lot simply cannot handle their volume.  I had to park across the street, which is a pretty busy street.....sounds like a petty thing, but I wouldn't want to do it in the Summer when temps are 115+ and you have to wait for the crosswalk light.\u000a\u000a5 Stars for the Food/Coffee, 1 Star for the parking.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

Our server was very attentive and made sure our glasses remained full.  \u000a\u000aWe dined on the patio around happy hour on a Wed evening, so it was full of business people after work.

VAttended a networking luncheon here.  If you've never been here before, the drive up to the restaurant is a bit confusing.  The directional signs to guide you to your destination are non-existent.  However, once you reach your destination, you're in for a real treat.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant is perched on top of a ridge that overlooks part of the Phoenix Valley.  The view is spectacular!  The food is great too.  There was passed hors d'oeuvres at the beginning of the event that were very tasty.  Then just before the main speaker began, we were all seated for lunch.\u000a\u000aWe were served a Petite Filet and some Veggies with a light Citrus Salad as an appetizer.  Both were very good.  The servers were great.  They kept our water and Iced Tea glasses full throughout the lunch and promptly took away our dishes after each course.  For dessert, we had Cheesecake topped with Berries...it was delish!\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a very good luncheon.  If they hold one here again, I will definitely attend.  I will also come back for a dinner with The Better Half.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 88%

VStopped here to pick up a case for my new iPhone.  An employee immediately came over to help me out.  He showed me a few cases and had samples so he could show me what the felt like and looked like on my phone.  After I picked out a case, I browsed the ear piece section.....picked out a new Jawbone ICON.\u000a\u000aI was in/out in 10 minutes.  Great service.....forgot to get his name, but he was very helpful.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VWe found this place because of Groupon last year.  We waited until the day before it expired to redeem it.  That was a mistake.  We made reservations for 7 pm and when we arrived the place was slammed.  Everyone was trying to redeem their Groupon.  Because we had a reservation, we thought we were golden....nope, we ended up waiting for 45 min.  You could tell that the employees were super stressed.  I actually felt bad for them.  The food was very good and we wanted to give this place another chance, so we decided to come back another time when they weren't busy with Grouponers.\u000a\u000aSeveral months later we returned and had a normal dinner here.  The service was excellent and we had a much better experience than before.\u000a\u000aSome of the menu items we sampled:\u000a\u000aEscargots - $10.95\u000aCaprese Salad - $13.95\u000aStuffed Shells (Spinach & Ricotta) - $17.95\u000aLasagna - $17.95\u000a\u000aThe Better Half loved the Escargots.  She ordered it both visits.  I enjoyed the Stuffed Shells the first time and had the Lasagna on the second trip.  Between the two, the Stuffed Shells were my favorite.  I'm glad we came back for a second trip.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 85%

VDriving in the area and hungry, I decided to give this place a try for lunch.  I looked at the menu on the wall and decided to order:\u000a\u000aCarne Asada Burrito, $5.59\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix?select=MfPA1uFY07lEvACv-o5CfQ#MfPA1uFY07lEvACv-o5CfQ\u000a\u000aBeans/Rice/Cheese Burrito, $2.98\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix?select=d-ovX_PN6CDCe7CUqOjLkg#d-ovX_PN6CDCe7CUqOjLkg\u000a\u000aThe service here was brutally slow.  The lady working the cash register could not multitask....it was agonizing.\u000a\u000aWhile waiting for my food, I went to the Salsa Bar to load up on Salsa.  Since I like spicy Salsa, I went for what appeared to be the spiciest one...turned out to be watered down, mild Gringo Juice...*bleh*.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix?select=VxCnEw9so_M2z8KJR1-vBw#VxCnEw9so_M2z8KJR1-vBw\u000a\u000aThe food came out after a long wait.  Customers were confused because the cashier was calling out the wrong orders and people were returning saying it wasn't what they ordered.  By this time, there were 8 or 9 of us waiting...it was a hot mess in there.\u000a\u000aI went for the Carne Asada Burrito first.  I took one bite and didn't like it...it was way too salty.  The Burrito was all Meat & a little Guac/Salsa combo...no Rice or Beans...that's a common recipe in some of these Taco shops.  Since there wasn't any other ingredients to soften the salty flavor, it was just bad.\u000a\u000aNext, I went for the Beans/Rice/Cheese (BRC) Burrito.  I took one bite and that one was bland.  I don't know if my taste buds were shot from the salty Carne Asada Burrito, but it wasn't good either.\u000a\u000aThe Salsa wasn't *meh* too and couldn't save it for me.  Towards the end of my meal, I noticed a guy speaking in Spanish to the cashier lady...she goes to the back and comes out with a couple of cups of "spicier" Salsa that was hidden in the back...dammit!  Secret menu I guess....\u000a\u000aThere are too many other good places in town, I won't be back here.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 0%

VI'm typically a fan of Rubio's.  I've been to many of their locations.  However, this one disappointed.  I ordered:\u000a\u000aSteak Burrito Especial, $6.99\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rubios-fresh-mexican-grill-phoenix-5?select=ZOzRhgzHjp_MipYqG2Kn6A#ZOzRhgzHjp_MipYqG2Kn6A\u000a\u000aSteak Street Taco, $1.89\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rubios-fresh-mexican-grill-phoenix-5?select=4KJ_NtL5G2EXKqIca2zehA#4KJ_NtL5G2EXKqIca2zehA\u000a\u000aThe food came out in a short time.  While I was waiting, I went to the Salsa Bar to grab a few cups of their spicy Salsa.  The first item I ate was the Steak Street Taco....the meat was dry and Guacamole was bland.  I poured a lot of the Salsa on it to add flavor and give it some moisture.  Very disappointing.\u000a\u000aNext, I had the Burrito.  That was dry too!  Even with the Sour Cream in the Burrito, it was dry...the Steak, Rice, Beans...all was dry.  Needless to say, I used a heavy dose of Salso on that as well.  To make it worse, the Chips that came with the Burrito were 1/2 fresh & crispy and 1/2 were covered in oil or stale...so they were chewy...that means they combined new, fresh Chips with a batch of old ones....bummer.\u000a\u000aOne positive thing is that the service here was outstanding.  The cashier was very friendly and had a nice, welcoming smile.  I also watched a customer complain that one of the sodas was out of syrup on the machine....the employee sincerely apologized and quickly remedied the situation by replacing the empty container with a new one.\u000a\u000aI'll have to come back and give this place another try, it may have been an off day for them.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

VOn a recommendation from a friend, I parked my car here for 3 days during a short trip.  I parked in the covered parking area thinking I'd protect my car.  However, it rained while I was gone and when I returned my car had water spots all over it.....so much for covered parking.\u000a\u000aThe good news is that it was only $11 per day and I signed up for their frequent parking card that will allow me to earn a free day for every 5 days I park....cool.\u000a\u000aThe shuttle to/from the airport is very convenient and the drivers are friendly and helpful.  They will pick you up at your car and drop you off at your car when you return.....that's pretty good service.  I like this place even though my car wasn't really covered.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 97%

VWhen I travel and need to leave my car parked somewhere, I choose to use PreFlight.  Since my last review over 2 yrs ago, I've continued to use this service.  It's located a short distance from the airport, but it's significantly cheaper than parking at the airport, so you can save some money.  They also have coupons available which add to the savings.\u000a\u000aI'm glad a friend referred me to this place early on.  Since then, I've recommended it to many friends and associates.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VI've been to this airport at least 8 times over the past 2 years.  It's a pretty decent airport......has decent food, bars and most importantly FREE Wifi for internet access.\u000a\u000aAnother reason I enjoy this airport is the easy pickup/drop off system for rental cars.  All you have to do is take one shuttle for all rental car companies, which takes you a couple of miles away to a central rental car location.  It's very easy and you don't have to deal with the airport pickup/drop off passenger traffic.  Very convenient.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a decent airport and the FREE Wifi is what makes it 4 Stars in my book.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  There's no doubt I will someday and I will be pleased as long as they hook up the internet access!

VUpon further review, I have to update my review of Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport....I must have been lucky the first few times I went through here....either that or this place went downhill fast.  Here's some of my frustrations with this place:\u000a\u000a- The FREE WiFi sucks.....the past 4 times I've been through this airport, I have been unsuccessful in connecting to their WiFi.  I can get the connection on my laptop, but it won't load up any pages.....don't know what the problem is, when I land in Vegas or San Diego, it works just fine there.\u000a\u000a\u000a- Car Rental return lanes through the airport is confusing.  I am willing to bet that 9 out of 10 people who try to find the car rental return lane have to attempt it at least 2 or 3 times to figure it out.....the directions and route is crazy confusing.  The rental center itself is convenient, and the process of returning your car is efficient, but driving there is a disaster.\u000a\u000a- Food options are limited once you go past security.  Not much going on there.\u000a\u000a- Gates have insufficient seating.  I don't get it....there's not enough seats at most of the gates.....it's very crowded and people are cramped all over the place.\u000a\u000aHopefully, they can upgrade it soon....it needs it.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%, but not by choice.

VTime to update my review.  All of my previous comments still apply....WiFi sucks, Car Rental building is far from the airport and takes a very long time to get to.  However, it's improved in 1 important area and gets bumped up 1 Star for it....the food has improved in the gate areas.\u000a\u000aSince my last review, they've added local Arizona restaurants like La Grande Orange and Sir Veza's Taco Garage.  Awesome move by the airport.  At least we're doing something right here.\u000a\u000aAlso, they've added an art display in the gate area before security.  Over the Summer they had bolo ties on display from all over the State.  Very cool.\u000a\u000aLet's keep improving this airport.  Now if they can just move car rental on-site...\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VAt the recommendation of a friend, I met a client here for lunch.  My client was arriving from out of town and this joint is very conveniently located near the airport.  I guess once upon a time, it was an actual stockyard.  Now, it's an old school restaurant that has a lot of character.\u000a\u000aAfter browsing the menu, I opted for a BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich & Fries, $10.  To wash it down, I ordered Iced Tea.\u000a\u000aThe Pork Sandwich was awesome, very tasty and a large portion.  You will get full.  The Fries were tasty as well.\u000a\u000aMy client was impressed with the restaurant and put it on his "best place near the airport to have a lunch meeting" list....+++\u000a\u000aThe service was great and we were able to have a good lunch meeting that left us both satisfied.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

For $47 per person, this was a great value.\u000a\u000aThe greens and fairways were in good condition and they didn't cram a lot of people onto the golf course, so the pace of play was just right.  There are some great views of Phoenix on certain holes.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n812L7Mz4104bQ5Goo7yQg?select=3xxxtMpGNa92_YOiw_iiYA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n812L7Mz4104bQ5Goo7yQg?select=yfSunO5v545PZhuraFLbFg\u000a\u000aThere's a menu board at the 9th hole tee box to order food to be ready at the turn, which is a huge convenience.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n812L7Mz4104bQ5Goo7yQg?select=s7_UPH3z_4TCSMB8xSBEyg\u000aAnother plus is that the beverage cart comes around often....:)\u000a\u000aFor the average golfer, this is a fun track.  Not sure it's challenging enough for the low handicap golfer.  Since I'm just an average golfer, I found it to be a good time.  The only knock is the location.....in the old Southern part of Phoenix near Baseline & 7th St.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 75%

VWell, this place surprised me.  I played in a golf tournament here and stayed overnight.  The rooms were decent and spacious and the property was well appointed in a classic Southwestern design.  Hanging out by the fire pits at night near the lobby was fun to have a night cap.\u000a\u000aThe property is sprawled out like a classic desert resort and it allows for a nice, peaceful stay.  I was impressed because it didn't feel like I was in the middle of Phoenix, it felt like a getaway.\u000a\u000aI'd like to come back in the Summer and stay for a weekend so we can go to the water park.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

VI needed to get some pants hemmed and this joint is the sister property for the cleaners I regularly use.  I called around the area and discovered that the normal price for hemming pants is $18, which is what they charge....a lot higher than what I'm use to, but what other choice do I have at this point?\u000a\u000aI dropped them off on a Saturday and they were ready by Wednesday.\u000a\u000aWhen I tried them on, they fit perfectly!

This is the closest gas station to their home and when we drive back home, we often need to fill up.  The lanes are wide and well lit at night.  It's a Shell, so plan to pay more than most other gas stations.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VA very nice theater in our neighborhood.  Here's a breakdown of my experience with it:\u000a\u000aPros\u000a+ It's very clean and offers a decent experience for watching a movie.  \u000a+ The teenage kids who work here are really nice and friendly.....which is rare nowadays.\u000a+ Decent selection of food outside the theater in the mall it's located in.\u000a+ They serve Icee, which brings back memories of 7-11 runs when I was a kid.\u000a\u000aCons\u000a- The food isn't bad, but of course the prices are high.  \u000a- Parking is challenging during peak hours.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a pretty good theater.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VI was shopping for a car and stopped by this dealership to check out a few of the models on their lot.  It was a Saturday afternoon and this place was packed!  I had to wait around 15 min for a salesperson to free up so I could test drive a couple of the cars I had on my list.  The receptionist was very friendly and talked to me while I waited.  She cooked up some Popcorn for the customers waiting in the lobby area and offered me some.  I wasn't in the mood for any, so I declined, but it was nice of her to offer.\u000a\u000aThe cars I test drove were ok, but they didn't "feel like my car", so I left empty handed.  On to the next dealership.  The shopping experience here was good and I would consider buying a car in the future from them.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 87%

VThis review is only for their meeting rooms and banquet facilities.  I've never stayed in the hotel.\u000a\u000aI've attended several lunch meetings and presentations here in their ballroom area.  Their banquet staff is top notch.  All of the lunches I've had here were very good.  To test the creativity of a banquet kitchen, I often ask for the Vegetarian option to see if it's as good as their typical Chicken or Filet option.  During one meeting, I did that and they came back with a Grilled Vegetable plate that was amazing.  It sounds simple, but it blew me away....kudos to the chef and team.\u000a\u000aThe ballroom area is great for business meetings and functions.  The large bar in the lobby area on the way to the ballroom is great for after meeting cocktails and networking.  Tucked away in Mesa, I was surprised to find such a quality hotel.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 85%

VThey have a nice selection of firearms here.  Lot's of quality AR's and pistols.  Nice selection of Sig Sauer 9mm pistols...decent number of 1911's from various manufacturers.  Plenty of ammo was available and prices are average.\u000a\u000aHowever, where they fell short for me was customer service.  I had to disrupt 3 of them chatting it up behind the counter to look at several guns and the guy was disinterested....he said nothing to me....I had to ask questions if I wanted any kind of information.  Maybe he was pissed off because I ruined his conversation with his buddies...I don't know and I don't care but it sure didn't seem like he wanted me to buy one, so I left empty-handed.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VWe stopped in here for happy hour one evening at 5 pm on a Friday and it was packed.  The place is split into 2 rooms and a patio.  We met a few friends in the back of one of the rooms.  We noticed there were peanut shells on the floor...cool, it's one of those places.\u000a\u000aSince they were so busy it took a long time to get our order placed.  We had to flag down a server to get her attention.  Since we didn't want to wait twice, we ordered our Beer and food at the same time.  We browsed the menu and decided to order:\u000a\u000aNachos, $10.99\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/teakwoods-tavern-and-grill-chandler?select=ruOZKt-DpRCwkcmVfGWchg#ruOZKt-DpRCwkcmVfGWchg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/teakwoods-tavern-and-grill-chandler?select=AqTkhQINOjPqzCu6D0Xrqw#AqTkhQINOjPqzCu6D0Xrqw\u000a\u000aPhilly Cheesesteak, $10.99\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/teakwoods-tavern-and-grill-chandler?select=xeOWkFF0VogD-h3tJYsJ0g#xeOWkFF0VogD-h3tJYsJ0g\u000a\u000aThe Nachos were huge, enough for 2 people.  They were good and had decent flavor.  The Guac and Sour Cream come in small cups so you have to dip your Chips in them or take a knife to put on your Chips....I don't prefer to eat my Nachos that way.\u000a\u000aThe Philly Cheesesteak was pretty good too....far from the best I've ever had, but decent.\u000a\u000aThere were plenty of TV's in the restaurant, so we were able to keep apprised of the hockey/football games on the tube.\u000a\u000aWe had to flag down the server for refills of the Beer....that was the one downside to the visit was the service.

VLocated all the way out in the outskirts of South Chandler near the Wild Horse Pass Casino, this golf course is a nice oasis that is fun to play.  The layout of the course is a modern desert course with very few trees.  There's a lot of desert areas and a few traps and water hazards...perfect for the average golfer.\u000a\u000aThe greens were well kept and rolled true despite having a lot of play on them.  We played on a Sunday morning and there were cars running at the nearby drag strip, so all day long you could hear the engines roaring in the distance....kind of cool, for some distracting....but it didn't bother me.\u000a\u000aThe clubhouse has a nice selection of golf accessories, but the prices are high as usual for golf clubhouses.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 87%

V3 Stars for the food, 5 Stars for the unique experience.....\u000a\u000aI stopped by this McDonald's location for a quick lunch one day and ordered 2 Double Cheeseburgers and Large Fries.  While I was waiting for my food, someone told me about a free car show they host in the parking lot every Saturday night.\u000a\u000aMy food was ready and I had a decent lunch.  It's McDonalds, so my expectations are pretty low.  Not bad for a quick meal.\u000a\u000aI then returned the next Saturday night to check out the car show.....it was pretty cool!  There are probably close to 100 cars here....everything from old classics (Chevy's, Corvettes, Camaros, Mustangs) to newer rice rockets (Acuras, Hondas, Toyotas) to exotics (Ferrari's, Lambos).  I was amazed!  Best part....it's FREE!\u000a\u000aBy the way.....the McDonalds was packed and making tons of money.....great idea!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100% (the Car show was a lot of fun, will definitely be back)

VTime for a review update.  I still love this place for the Saturday car shows, they get 5 Stars for that.  It's the longest running car show in Arizona I believe.  It's so much fun and it's free.\u000a\u000aThey get a bump up in stars because over the past 2 yrs, they've delivered great customer service and the food is always fresh by fast food standards.  Also, McDonald's has stepped up it's menu and offered a variety of new items that are tasty and unique.  Their Iced Coffee is very good...and I'm not a Coffee drinker.\u000a\u000aI come here primarily for breakfast and an occasional lunch....and the car shows.\u000a\u000aIf you have a free Saturday night and like cars, give it a try....especially during the nice weathered months.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VI like to use this gas station because for some reason it's rarely busy when I stop by to fill up my tank.  It's located right off the 101 & Indian Bend Road next the the McDonald's.  I'm not the type of person to compare gas prices and drive all over town to save a few pennies per gallon, but maybe the gas prices here are higher than other stations?  I don't know.....I like the fact I don't have to zig/zag around other cars at the pumps.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

VThis review is for the repair shop at the gas station.  It's easily the best in town.  Over the past 2 months, I've had to bring 3 of our cars in here for service.  In all 3 cases, they did a great job and saved us a ton of money.\u000a\u000aOne of our cars was intermittently having trouble starting.  The Wife took it to a different shop closer to our house.  They looked at it and told her it would cost $98 in labor plus another $300 or so....$400 seemed high, so I told her to tow it to the Pavilions Auto shop.  They looked at it and discovered it was a faulty switch...total damage?  $90....yes, $90!\u000a\u000aAnother car had the AC acting up and I took it to the dealership originally.  They looked at it and said they couldn't find anything wrong.....ok, so how do you explain why it's not as cold as my other cars?  Well, they said it's blowing cool air and it's a normal temperature....I didn't buy that answer, so I took it to this shop.  They looked at it and said I needed refrigerant added to the system because it was really low....guess what?  AC problem fixed, total damage $60...ha!  That's nothing in exchange for a cold AC in AZ.\u000a\u000aAnother car of mine was sitting in the garage for a few years and when I went to start it, the battery was dead.  I took it here and they discovered it was just a battery.  They could've easily added on a few "fixes" to jack up the bill and I would've paid it because it was sitting in the garage for so long...but they didn't.  Total damage was $130 for a new battery.  \u000a\u000aI'm taking my cars only to this shop, end of story.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VMet some friends for Easter Dinner here.  I thought it would be packed, but it wasn't.  Since I hadn't had Meat for a while, I was looking forward to this dinner.\u000a\u000aAfter browsing the menu, I decided to go for the Porcini Rubbed Filet Mignon (center cut, grilled high country Asparagus\u000aspears, Gorgonzola Cream Sauce).  For a side dish, I selected the Chipotle Mac & Cheese.  My friends ordered a bottle of Wine and we were good to go!\u000a\u000aThe Filet was soooo good!  The Gorgonzola Cream Sauce added a rich, creamy flavor to the succulent center cut Filet.  I requested it Medium and it was cooked to perfection.  The Chipotle Mac & Cheese was a perfect complement to the Filet.....I highly recommend it.\u000a\u000aThe service was pretty good to.  Our glasses of Wine were never empty and we ordered a Chocolate Lava Cake w/Vanilla Ice Cream & Whipped Cream and split it between the 3 of us.  It was awesome!\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a great dinner with good friends.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VTime to update my review of this place.  Besides the awesome Steaks they have here, this is a great spot for happy hour.  We meet friends and associates here often for happy hour.  They have this awesome "5 for $6 'til 7" happy hour menu:\u000a\u000a5 Wines, 5 Cocktails, 5 Appetizers, 2 Entrees, or 2 Blue Moons for $6 ea....that's an amazing deal!\u000a\u000aWe enjoy the Wines of course and some of the appetizers we get are the Roasted Pork Belly, Carpaccio, and Mushroom Ravioli.  Our fav entree is the Prime Burger w/Cheese & Bacon...it's a huge Burger for only $6.\u000a\u000aThis is a great spot for dinner or happy hour, check it out if you can.  Best part is we love to get the gift cards from Costco....$80 for $100 worth of cards....that saves us an additional 20%.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VBelieve it or not, I haven't had the Pizza here yet.  I'm a huge fan of Pizza, but the reason for my visit is Pizza Puffs.  Yes, those mouthwatering pocket filled morsels of goodness.....it's one of the food items I associate with Chicago.\u000a\u000aWhen I heard this joint had Pizza Puffs, I immediately stopped by for lunch one day.  I ordered an Italian Sub & a Pizza Puff.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6zincCvQTb9BsuK-GHZ4cw?select=Bb3c9tM6uvXJmgaiT9B8eA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6zincCvQTb9BsuK-GHZ4cw?select=32uwfuBXI-ig7g6METKPKA\u000a\u000aThe Italian Sub was served hot and came out first.  I kind of wish the Pizza Puff came out at the same time because it takes a little while for the Pizza Puff to cool off....but that's ok.\u000a\u000aThe Italian Sub was very good.  It was a nice sized portion, not too big & not too small, just right for lunch.  The Deli Meats are tasty served hot and the Bread was very good!\u000a\u000aThe Pizza Puff was brought out to me a short time later.  I couldn't wait to take a bite....hmmmm, it's just like they serve them in Chicago.  If you've never had a Pizza Puff, do yourself a favor and go out and try one as soon as possible....You'll be glad you did!\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a nice lunch, satisfying my taste for Chicago.  They also serve Pizza and Dog's here, so I will be back!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VUnfortunately, in Scottsdale you can't find a freakin' Pizza joint open late.  This is the only option for us in the part of the city.  We've ordered delivery from this place at least 5 times over the past year.\u000a\u000aThey're always on time, so that's a bonus.  However, the Pizza is good only about 60% of the time.  3 out of the 5 orders we've placed were decent.  The other 2 times the Pizza wasn't as fresh.  Another time they forgot our dipping sauces.  Here are some photos from the best Pizza we had:\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ot9iwwY_oSzf9VWkEl4XkA?select=7pH63u5XzVYQWsTz7vFAyg\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ot9iwwY_oSzf9VWkEl4XkA?select=2ngodDyMj6M0szyBbGSJ5g\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ot9iwwY_oSzf9VWkEl4XkA?select=Ijho6NWvYC6PQYbfhoO0ew\u000a\u000aThat day, they were firing on all cylinders.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%...Because we have no other late night options.

VHad this place bookmarked after watching Adam Richman eat a dozen sliders on Man vs Food.  Since I was in the area I decided to stop by for lunch.  The place was packed and I had to wait a few minutes to be seated. While I was waiting I browsed the Bakery side of the joint.  I didn't realize it was a Bakery & a Deli.\u000a\u000aThe Bakery had a ton of awesome looking Desserts....I almost scrapped lunch in favor of a Dessert or two, ha!  But my name was called and I went to be seated.\u000a\u000aThe food menu is pretty large and I had a tough time selecting a dish.  I asked my server for her opinion and she suggested trying the Sliders and making a combo with the Original Jewish Sliders (Mini Challah Rolls, Brisket, Potato Pancakes, Jack Cheese, Brown Gravy) and the Western Sliders (Mini Challah Rolls, BBQ Brisket, Cheddar Cheese, Onion Strings).....there would be 3 Sliders of my choice and Fries for $11.99.  I decided to go for it and ordered the combo with 1 Original Jewish Slider and 2 BBQ Beef Sliders.\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait my food came out.  I couldn't wait to dive into it.  I went for the Jewish Slider first.  I've never had anything like this before.....it was dripping with Gravy.  Took one bite and could taste the Gravy, Potato Pancake, and Jack Cheese immediately....then I could taste the Brisket, which was very moist.  It was pretty good, but I'm not a big fan of Gravy unless it's Thanksgiving.\u000a\u000aNext I went for the BBQ Brisket Sliders......they were very tasty.  The proportion of BBQ Sauce and Onion Strings were just right to give it that Sweet & Tangy flavor.  Of the two types of Sliders I prefer the BBQ Sliders over the Jewish Sliders.  The Fries were Breaded Wedge Cut Fries and were awesome......crispy on the outside and moist & soft on the inside.  The spices on the Fries were very good too.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a good meal.  My server was very friendly and checked up on me often to make sure I was satisfied with my meal.  She offered to replace the Jewish Slider if I didn't like it.  I told her that it was good and then she suggested Pumpkin Creme Brulee for Dessert.  I wasn't planning on Dessert, but couldn't resist and said yes.  It came out and the portion was pretty big.....there was no way I could finish it but I gave it a good shot and ate 1/2 of it.  It was very flavorful and gave my meal a nice Holiday Touch.\u000a\u000aI enjoyed my meal here and got my money's worth.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet.....I might actually give that 12 Slider Challenge a shot if I'm in the mood.

I especially like it because you can get the salon size version of the product you're looking for and save a few bucks.  They also carry a lot of the new items that your stylist might have but are extremely hard to find in a grocery store.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VThe staff is very friendly here.  Plenty of suits, sports coats, and other clothing to choose from.  However, I found the styles and cuts of the suits to be lacking.  The stripes of a pin striped suit should match up on the seams, but some of their styled didn't.  If I'm going to pay $549 for a suit, it better be well made.\u000a\u000aI prefer to buy a sports coat here.  They're more reasonably priced at around $119 and designed well.\u000a\u000aThe Staff gets 5 Stars in my book.  Overall, 3 Stars for the store.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VOh boy, where do I start?  A colleague suggested that we come here for a lunch meeting one day.  He said they had the best French Dip Sandwich in town.  Seduced by this claim, I had to give this place a try.  Of course, my first time there I had to try this legendary Sandwich.  Priced at $20, it better be good...\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/houstons-scottsdale?select=U0ixpfN85zASG-5U8eBq1w#U0ixpfN85zASG-5U8eBq1w\u000a\u000aI took one bite and OMG...!  It was friggin' awesome!  Even better than I expected.  The flavor of the Prime Rib and the Au Jus sent my taste buds into the stratosphere.  It also comes with a Creamy Horseradish Sauce that just adds to the flavor explosion.  The Bread is Buttered and soft, but had just the right texture to hold this all together and complimented the sharp flavors of the Beef and Sauce.  Wow, it is a masterpiece.\u000a\u000aThe service here is also impeccable.  You feel like you're dining in a 5 diamond restaurant....and it's lunch!\u000a\u000aI was so impressed after that 1st visit, that I've been back several times and have brought many friends and colleagues to experience the French Dip.\u000a\u000aMy other favorite item is the Hickory Burger (Canadian Bacon, Cheddar Cheese, Onion, w/Hickory Sauce), $14.  \u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/houstons-scottsdale?select=CYjS0T6wl1Pe9fX_-DV9mw#CYjS0T6wl1Pe9fX_-DV9mw\u000aThat's right folks, there's a thick slice of Canadian Bacon that tops this Burger!  This is a big bad Burger....and it tastes awesome!  I can barely take a bite out of it....and it's not like some freakishly huge Burger, but the ingredients are fresh and stacked high....making for an awesome Burger.\u000a\u000aFor sides, the Cole Slaw is by far the best you can order and I highly recommend that.  The Fries are so/so.  \u000a\u000aAnother tip, if you come for lunch you can make reservations.  It can get busy, so it's worth the extra step to do so.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VStayed here twice and attended a conference during one of those stays.  The resort is an older style, spread out over a large area.  If you get a room in the back, like I did, it can make for a long day if you're attending a conference.\u000a\u000aI like to be able to go back/forth easily to my room when I attend a conference.  Next time, I'll opt for one closer to the front desk.\u000a\u000aThe rooms are ok, nothing special.  The beds are so/so....I got decent sleep, that's all that matters.\u000a\u000aThe best  part of the stay is the complimentary Cookies at the front desk....yum!\u000a\u000aOverall, it wasn't bad for the price ($75/night).\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

VWhenever we go to a party in Paradise Valley, we book a room here and take an Execucar to/from the party so we have a place to crash.  We don't like driving down the dark, unlit streets of PV and especially if we're going to have a few drinks.  This hotel is very convenient for us to stay in those situations.\u000a\u000aLuckily, we've stayed here before, so we're familiar with the room layout on the property.  However, the first time staying here is a little disorienting because the buildings all look alike and the numbering system doesn't make sense when you're in the middle of the property.\u000a\u000aAs described in my prior review, the rooms are ok.  They're larger than most rooms by today's standards, but the decor is a bit dated....it's fine for our needs.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 75%

VStayed here a few weeks ago.  The rooms are pretty nice.  It's a Hilton, so I expect the rooms to be decent.  It's an older design with the property spread out.  Since the property is large and offers various entrances from the parking lot, I don't recommend valet parking as it is more convenient to park your car near the entrance to the door closest to your room.\u000a\u000aOne of the great things about this hotel is that it has a Fleming's on property.  We enjoy Fleming's Steaks, so that's always a big plus in our book.\u000a\u000aI highly recommend that friends consider staying here when visiting the Scottsdale area.  It's located on Scottsdale Rd, a short distance to Old Town where all of the eats and fun places are.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 89%

VTime for a review update.  The two main reasons I visit this hotel is to dine at Fleming's and to attend conferences.  Conferences are perfect for this hotel because the parking for the meeting space is in the back where the ballroom is located, so it's an easy in/out parking situation.  The banquet staff is experienced and do a good job taking care of attendees.  The banquet food here is good too.\u000a\u000aFleming's is awesome as usual.  Separate review for them...but in short, they have a great happy hour and awesome Steaks.\u000a\u000aBesides that, all of my comments from my last review still apply.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

Everyone from the front desk clerk to the staff at the sports bar are very friendly.\u000a\u000aI especially like the proximity to Old Scottsdale (a mile or so) and shopping on Scottsdale Road (a couple of blocks).\u000a\u000aThe bed is pretty comfortable....not the best I've ever slept in, but very good.

VWas in the mood for breakfast at lunchtime, so I dropped by this location.  I was able to find a table pretty quickly.  I had my mind made up on what I wanted.....a Veggie Omelet (Tomatoes, Mushrooms, Bell Peppers, Onions) w/Sourdough Toast and Hash Browns.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JFhfVTt_8xNjtwqSD-raIw?select=M3s_sXbAS8D-Cfylaa6Qww\u000a\u000aThe food came out fast and I was surprised to see large slices of Tomatoes on top of the Omelet instead of chopped up inside.....this was the first time I've ever had a Veggie Omelet like that.....turns out I like it this way!  The Omelet was cooked well, not runny....which is a good thing.  The only thing I didn't like about the Omelet was the Mushrooms....they were definitely canned and not cut fresh...other than that, it was a solid Omelet.\u000a\u000aThe Hash Browns were OK, and the Sourdough Toast was very good....should have asked for it dry, but forgot to do that.  I like my Toast dry.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a nice breakfast during lunch.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VNeeded to get some keys made, so I dropped by here.  The key machine is located at the front of the store at the customer service/returns desk.  I popped in and they made my keys within minutes.  The girl working the machine was really efficient and got me out of there fast......which is great because I hate waiting.\u000a\u000aWill have to drop by here for other home stuff another time.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 84%

VI needed to get 4 new tires on my car.  After asking around the office, everyone recommended this location.  I made an appointment on their website for 8 am sharp.  I told the guy working the counter that I didn't want to pay for the most expensive set of tires they offered.\u000a\u000aHe gave me 3 options:\u000a\u000a$950 ($850 w/$100 discount), $800 ($725 w/$75 discount), or $725 ($650 w/$75 discount).  Prices were all-inclusive of tires, installation, balancing, alignment etc.  That was much lower than the $1,350 that the dealership was going to charge me....(RIP OFF).\u000a\u000aI went with the $650 option and within 1 hr my car was ready.  One word to describe my experience: Awesome.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90% (See you in 60,000 miles)

VI drop by this Chevron from time to time.  It gets very busy during the daytime.  I used to come here more frequently, but I find that sometimes they're out of premium unleaded, but I don't know until I pull up to the pump and see a little note on the pump.  That irritates me.  However, when I need gas and I'm in the area, I have no choice.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

Since everyone recommended the Italian Hoagie, I decided to order it.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GTuAPBRsM5dVPqPy9oe14Q?select=wlDWkJfzaYGWqDVviW9-og\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GTuAPBRsM5dVPqPy9oe14Q?select=YIheIM7GeCTUlLRrczkM_Q\u000a\u000aThe Bread on the Hoagie was pretty good, but I thought it was a little on the dry side.  Would have enjoyed a little more Oil in it.  The ingredients tasted fresh and it was a solid Sandwich.....not the best I ever had, but pretty good.  Will have to come back to try some of their other stuff.\u000a\u000aThey're not open on Sundays, so I'll have to try and squeeze in a visit during the week.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 85%

VIt's an old mall and the parking lots desperately need to be updated because they're not logical.  However, despite all that, this is a shopping mall on the rise.  Recent additions Blimpie's, Hooters, and Chipotle have added to the food mix.  Octane Raceway, an indoor/outdoor kart facility will open soon.....and so will Buffalo Wild Wings.\u000a\u000aI also enjoy coming to the McDonald's car show on Saturdays.  The best and most honest mechanic shop is also here at the Shell station.  My regular, quick lunch stops...Taco Bell, McDonald's, and Filiberto's are here too.\u000a\u000aThis will never be a premium shopping mall....but it's still very enjoyable and functional.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

However, the discovery of the Froyo station was the find of the day!  AYCE Salad, Bread, and Froyo?!  I can deal with that!\u000a\u000a**Hint** - Google "Sweet Tomatoes Coupons" and you'll find a ton of coupons on the web to use for discounted prices.  I took the family here for dinner and we only paid $7.99 each with the coupon....awesome!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VI've stopped by this Deli for lunch and breakfast.  When I came for lunch, I ordered a 10" Italian Sandwich ($6.79)\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UkqdcwYv6_c-yW1JPCKlUA?select=FvhTfKVsGt5FXtfjL7dgEw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UkqdcwYv6_c-yW1JPCKlUA?select=qaOSRK-FMOUZgooSqY8R4w\u000a\u000aThe Sandwich was very difficult to eat because it was served open-faced with the Meat pushing the Bread open....very strange as it made it difficult to fold back over and hold.  Also, they douse the bread with the Oil/Vinegar, so it gets soggy and breaks apart....WTH?  The taste was pretty good, but the experience sucked.  You can see what I'm talking about in my pics.\u000a\u000aThe 2nd time I stopped here, it was to try their Breakfast Burritos.....since the Max Burro was priced at $4.29, I only ordered 1 because I thought it would be huge....I was wrong, it was just a Med sized Burrito.  It was pretty good....Eggs, Bacon, Cheese, wrapped in a Tortilla.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UkqdcwYv6_c-yW1JPCKlUA?select=8gpyTOcWz6BWYTxxTc-UnA\u000aI was disappointed with the size though.....I was still hungry after I finished it....bummer.  I didn't think the $4.29 was worth it...I think $3.50 would be a more appropriate price for a Med sized Breakfast Burrito.\u000a\u000aOverall, I think this place has potential....right now, it only gets 3 Stars from me.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 67%

VIt was our Son's Junior Prom this year and he wanted to rent a tux.  I remember my first tux rental many moons ago....and how awkward that experience was.  Well, that wasn't the case here.  The girl who helped us was only a couple of years older than him and knew a few people that attended his high school....so he immediately felt comfortable talking to her and listening to her advice on what to pick.\u000a\u000aShe asked him questions about color, style, etc.....he looked at her like a deer in the headlights....it was hilarious.  Of course he didn't want to go with my selections because I'm the old guy who's choice of style is "outdated"....what?!  Whatever, I don't understand the kids nowadays and their sense of style...so I was happy to have the young girl employee assist us.  I stepped back and let them do their thing.\u000a\u000aShe showed him the options and helped him pick it....my role was to pay the bill.  After it was all said and done, the total damage was $181, which included the tuxedo, shirt, vest, tie, cufflinks, and shoes.  It's too bad Kiddo is not the same size as me, otherwise I would've bought a tuxedo instead of paying that much to rent one....and he'll probably outgrow it for his Senior Prom, so I paid the rental price instead.\u000a\u000aThe day we went to the store, there were at least a dozen other kids waiting in line behind us to get fitted for tuxedo rentals...we picked the wrong time to go but lucked out and came just after they opened, so we beat the rush by a few minutes.  They didn't rush us though and thanks to the great service of that girl, he was happy and had a good time at his first prom....memories that will last forever.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

VTime for a review update.  Over the past few years, we've attended at least 2 dozen special events, gala's, and foodie events here.  It's a popular choice for charities to stage their gala's.  From Fall through Spring, there will be several large gala's here.  Those are very fun and well executed by the Westin staff.  The banquet staff are very professional and do a great job.  The ballroom space has high ceilings and has an upscale look and feel.  For some events, they utilize the separate entrance area to the main ballroom for valet parking.  When they do that, it's very convenient to park.\u000a\u000aBesides the special events, this resort has 2 great golf courses, awesome restaurants, and a surfing pool in their pool area.  The surfing pool is fun for people watching.  Very few people can pull off surfing on that thing....most wipeout.  I've never tried it because I know I will definitely wipeout.  If I was 10 yrs younger, I'd do it.\u000a\u000aOverall, this is a fun, upscale resort.  One of these days, I will stay here for a staycation.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VAttended Mass last weekend.  It's held in a building that resembles a school meeting hall rather than a church.  It was a nice service.....friendly community.  I felt welcome here, however I prefer a more traditional church environment.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VNow that football season has started, I looked for another church that has 8 am mass, so I can get back home in time for the 10 am games....yeah yeah, I know.\u000a\u000aI hadn't been here in 2 yrs, but over the past 2 weekends, I've come here for the 8 am mass and became a fan of Fr. Parks.  His homilies are spot on and relevant to today's problems and gave me food for thought.  So while I was brought here for different reasons, I'm glad I did because I got so much more out of it.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VTucked away just off the corner of Thunderbird and Scottsdale Rd, I've driven down Scottsdale Rd hundreds of times and have never seen it.  Thanks to Groupon, we found this joint.  There's a Ferarri Testarossa parked under a small canopy as you enter the restaurant....very retro/cool, was expecting to see Tom Selleck in the restaurant...LOL  Actually, it's pretty cool.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arrivederci-scottsdale?select=XwbYXd3iwsRqfRCqoIk6iQ#XwbYXd3iwsRqfRCqoIk6iQ\u000a\u000aThe place was packed when we arrived, good thing we had reservations via Open Table.

It was very good.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arrivederci-scottsdale?select=pr4ZJ1w3FnvFdudt0TlzAQ#pr4ZJ1w3FnvFdudt0TlzAQ\u000a\u000aWe ordered our food and after a short wait it came out.

The portion size was just right and we didn't get full before our entrees came out.\u000a\u000aA short time later, the entrees came out.  I sampled a little Gnocchi from The Better Half...it was very, very good...yum!  I had the Ravioli....they were cooked perfectly al dente...the Tomato Sauce was homemade with fresh ingredients and full of flavor.\u000a\u000aAfter dinner, we were surprised with a complimentary shot of Limoncello from our waiter.  He said it was to help cleanse the palate for Dessert...great!  He read our mind...we ordered a Chocamisu to split for Dessert.  It came out a short time later and was heavenly...soft, creamy, sweet just like it's supposed to be.\u000a\u000aOverall, we were very pleased with our visit to Arrivederci.

VFriends of ours invited us to join them for dinner and a night out dancing.

It exceeded my expectations.  Even though it wasn't a premium cut of Beef, it was cooked perfectly and had good flavor.  The Enchiladas were out of this world...wow!  All I can say is wow!\u000a\u000aThe Better Half had the Sliders and she was very happy with them.  The portion comes with 2 Sliders, which is perfect for her.\u000a\u000aAfter dinner, the music started to play.  We then got our groove on and danced to country & classic rock songs.  The bar also filled up and there was a nice crowd there.  We all had a blast and worked off the calories we ate.\u000a\u000aWe heard they have country dance lessons on Wednesdays, so we'll be back.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VI love playing golf and have never played in Scottsdale....until this business trip where I had the opportunity to play in a tournament at this course.  Despite the 105 degree temperatures, I had a great time.  It's a good thing I live in Vegas and have done this many times.  For my 300th review, here are my thoughts on the South Course:\u000a\u000a- The driving range is grass, so you're hitting of natural stuff....not mats.  Plenty of room at the driving range to accommodate the tournament players and regular guests....one of my pet peeves is a crowded range during tournaments.\u000a\u000a- The course is kept in great condition.  Normally, around this time of the year they start preparing for overseeding, which means they'll dry out the course and it can be unplayable....not here.  Great condition.\u000a\u000a- The course is pretty wide open, so it's somewhat forgiving.  Can be fun for both beginners and scratch golfers.\u000a\u000a- The greens weren't too fast, but rolled true for most holes....you can't ask for much more than that.\u000a\u000a- The rough isn't too bad if you're off the fairway.....but beyond that and you're in the desert.  Beware of the rattlesnakes & coyotes (see pics) if you decide to go get your ball in the desert.....I decided that a $2 ball is not worth it.\u000a\u000a- The bar at the clubhouse has a Hop Knot IPA on tap that is amazing....a great way to end a day in the sun!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You won't have to ask me twice!  Fun track!

VWe needed some treats for the dogs and stopped by this location.  It was raining cats & dogs outside (pun intended) and decided to kill some time until the storm passed over....so, we walked around the store looking at the cats, birds, fish, etc.  As we walked around the store, we were entertained at all of the dogs in the store...we could never bring our dogs in the store, they'd freak out being around the others.\u000a\u000aSince we do a lot of traveling, we also looked at rates for the pet hotel....$29 per night is not bad.  We'll have to consider bringing the dogs here so the entire family can have a trip together.  We always hesitate to do that though....wish we knew more about it.\u000a\u000aWe found the treats we were looking for and they were on sale....$3.59 down from $5.99...cool, we bought 3 different flavors to give the doggies a variety.  We also needed a new ID tag for one of the dogs and did one of those self service laser tags for $9.50.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a good day at the pet store.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VA friend of mine introduced me to this place several years ago before I moved here.  Since I moved here, we've dined here three times.  It's a fun, casual place to take your family and enjoy bar food.  Here's a breakdown of what I've had:\u000a\u000aPhilly Cheesesteak Sandwich (Whole, $14.95) - Really good.  The Bread is decent and the Whole sized portion is enough for 2 people.\u000a\u000aUncle Sam's Special Pizza (18" Large, $23.95) - It has virtually every topping on it.  Because it's crammed with toppings, it tends to get a little soggy even if it's ordered well done, which is how I order it.  Flavor is pretty good.  We always take a few slices home and it heats up well for leftovers.\u000a\u000aWings (Baker's Dozen, $7.95) - Our friends don't like the really spicy stuff, so we always order the Medium spice level and the Spicy on the side.  The Wings are really good.  Always served hot and they break away from the bone well.  The Spicy sauce isn't too Spicy....I like spicy food, so it's about average for me.\u000a\u000aLarge basket of Fries $3.23 - Decent sized basket.  Can serve 2-3 people.  Average flavor, reminds me of Wendy's Fries in terms of size and style.\u000a\u000aLarge basket of Fried Zucchini $4.95 - Can serve 2-3 people.  The flavor is average.  Always served hot and crispy.  I've never had soggy Zucchini here, which is a pet peeve.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant has plenty of seating and can easily accommodate a large group.  During one visit we had 8 people and it was very comfortable.  The Happy Hour here is pretty good, but I've never been able to try it because I'm always working.  The wait staff is young and relatively inexperienced, so you have to stay on top of them...however, that's to be expected in a restaurant like this.\u000a\u000aOverall, we enjoy this place and will definitely return.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VHmm, let's see.....a bar with walls full of large TV's, Beer, and good food....yes, I'll take it!

VA friend of mine invited us to dinner here.  It's been a while since we've been to Macaroni Grill.  We use to eat at a Macaroni Grill for lunch all the time, but in recent years have ignored it.\u000a\u000aI have a favorite dish....the Pasta Milano (Roasted Chicken, Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Mushrooms, Farfalle Pasta in a roasted Garlic Cream Sauce, $11.99).....but I got it without Chicken since I'm on a no Meat diet.\u000a\u000aThe Better Half ordered the Crusted Sole (Filet of Sole topped w/Lemon Butter & served w/Sun-Dried Tomato, Spinach Orzo, $14.99).\u000a\u000aI didn't like my Pasta Milano.....the Cream Sauce was very watery and didn't have much flavor....bland, which has never happened to me when I've ordered it.\u000a\u000aThe Better Half enjoyed her Sole, but didn't think it was anything beyond average.\u000a\u000aMy friend ordered the King Salmon ($17.99) and enjoyed it.\u000a\u000aIf I was rating this dinner on my experience alone, it would have been 2 Stars....but since the other two dining with me enjoyed their meal, I'm bumping it up to 3.  The service was so/so.....young wait staff here with plenty to learn about service....I didn't ding them because of their inexperience.  They were pleasant and sincere....which goes a long way with me.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 30%

VFound this place because I bought 3 Groupons.  The first time we came here was the week after the Groupon came out, which is always a mistake because this place was filled to the gills!  We were lucky to snag a table for 4 after only a short 10 minute wait.  However, several people ahead of us left because of the wait.  The other 2 visits here were no problem, but that was because it was 4+ weeks later and the Groupon rush was over.\u000a\u000aAfter 3 visits, here's my breakdown of the joint:\u000a\u000a+We enjoy the Mom & Pop feel to the place.  It's cozy and comforting.\u000a\u000a+The food is pretty good.  I've had the Pancakes, Breakfast Burrito, and Waffle.  All very very good.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/V81Ahkb9QFlbEx4PoeRiyA?select=rFCTC-tGavGymtsmc-ddHQ\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/V81Ahkb9QFlbEx4PoeRiyA?select=MV3p0qgtMtc0j2wg-rItQA\u000a\u000a+There's Gluten-Free options.  The Better Half enjoys those options even though she's not allergic to Gluten.\u000a\u000a-The Coffee is terrible.  Watered down.\u000a\u000a-The prices are a bit high, but considering the quality of the food isn't too bad.  Just don't expect to come in and get Denny's or IHOP pricing.  Let's just say I'm glad I had the Groupon.\u000a\u000aOverall, we enjoyed our visits here.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

The Hot Link was actually spicy, which is often not the case.  The Potatoes were very tasty as well.  My only complaint was that it was kind of a small portion...I was left wanting more.\u000a\u000aMy server was very friendly and welcoming.  She asked how I found the joint and addressed me by name when I left....very cool.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 98%

VMy 1st memory of Whataburger was in the early 80's in Southern California sometime before I was 10 yrs old.  We had one on the main drag of the city I grew up in.  It was gone by the time I was a teenager.....however, I remember the distinct orange & white striped building and the Burgers.\u000a\u000aI was excited to finally give it a try as an adult.  I ordered a Whataburger ($2.64) w/Bacon ($1.17) & Cheese ($.49)....and the cashier suggested I add Jalapenos ($.49)....\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93E1eOQ2bQG0OyIMqdcTvg?select=YKkzLz967qEgfA5eqyqLdA\u000ayes, it's really a la carte pricing, LOL!\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93E1eOQ2bQG0OyIMqdcTvg?select=Wb0gZDFFQxcuphBQ9eHCsQ\u000a\u000aI was really hungry, so I also ordered a Honey BBQ Chicken Strip Sandwich ($4.64) & Sm Fries ($1.39).\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93E1eOQ2bQG0OyIMqdcTvg?select=MJOS72B9ZlfsPbsNsznntg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93E1eOQ2bQG0OyIMqdcTvg?select=rjwgNh2n7fSapWGco38MoQ\u000a\u000aThe Burger was OK, nothing special.....it did taste just how I remember it.  The distinct flavor of the Onions & Mustard in the Burger brought back memories.  The Chicken Strip Sandwich was above average, which surprised me.  The Chicken is real, White Meat Chicken Breast, and the BBQ Sauce was decent.  The Fries were just OK.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was an OK meal for a fast food joint.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 71%

VI haven't bowled in years.  So when a group of friends put together an outing here, I had to come.  We bowled on a Saturday afternoon around 1 pm and the place was wide open.  They had the black lights, neon, loud music, and lasers going on...kind of weird to have cosmic bowling in the middle of the day....whatever, it was cool.\u000a\u000aWe paid $20 for 2 of us to play 2 games each....$5 per game.  Price comes with the shoes.  The selection of bowling balls is kind of limited.  It took us a little while to find a ball for us to use.  Bowling was fun though...very laid back and everyone had a good time.\u000a\u000aThe food options here are ok....Hot Dogs, Pizza, Fries....typical bowling alley food.  On the plus side...they serve Nathan's Hot Dogs...so at least they're quality.  The Pizza is plain though...below average.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/brunswick-via-linda-lanes-scottsdale?select=W8kuwKmK0s-yqa3Z_yWD0w#W8kuwKmK0s-yqa3Z_yWD0w\u000a\u000aSome other notes - They also have a pool table in another room.  There are lockers available to store your stuff.  If you want to drink alcoholic beverages, they have a small lounge/bar...will have to check that out next time.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a very good time.  Since it's in the neighborhood, we'll definitely be back.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VStopped by for lunch around 11:30 and it wasn't too busy yet.  Looked at the menu and ordered:\u000a\u000aBig Daddy Sandwich (Cappacolla Ham, Coteghino Bologna, Genoa Salami, Ham, Pepperoni, Provolone, Black Olives, Pepperoncinis, Lettuce, Onions, Tomatoes, Parmesan Asiago, Oregano, Oil, Red Wine Vinegar, Mayo), $7.49\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cousins-subs-scottsdale-2?select=5a58W9LHNH6AWP912YWjyg#5a58W9LHNH6AWP912YWjyg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cousins-subs-scottsdale-2?select=kumKHw5gR7_Spho1gQjaBw#kumKHw5gR7_Spho1gQjaBw\u000a\u000aChips & Drink, $2.59\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cousins-subs-scottsdale-2?select=JuQo7zFEAoR4DhL8dk35NA#JuQo7zFEAoR4DhL8dk35NA\u000a\u000aThe old guy working the register was super nice and suggested that I get the Sandwich cut in half to make it easier to eat.  I followed his advice and it paid off.  The Sandwich is stuffed full of the ingredients and is quite messy to handle.  If it wasn't cut in half, it would've been even messier.\u000a\u000aThe Sandwich tasted pretty good and the Bread was also above average.  Their house brand Chips were also above average and had a unique taste to them...to me they were almost like Sour Cream & Onion more than Jalapeno.\u000a\u000aOverall, a good lunch experience.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VI really wanted to like this place....a friend of mine recommended it.  I wanted to grab a quick bite and watch the Lakers game....so I headed here.  The good news.....the Lakers game was on & the service was pretty good.....the bad news....the food was awful.\u000a\u000aI ordered:\u000a\u000aSlice of Cheese Pizza - $1.95\u000aNacos - $6.25\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K-vBVV_RZX-BeyqOBWjsDg?select=2xK8WXBCBc62Yn81yFgmvw\u000a\u000aThe first thing I went after was the Nachos....I knew it wasn't going to be good when I pulled the first Chip and the Cheese slipped off because it was already somewhat cold and coagulated....then I bit into it....yep, it was cold, blech!  I tried to eat it, but could only muster a few bites.  So, I went to the Pizza....\u000a\u000aAs most of my Yelp friends know, I love Pizza....so I couldn't wait to give it a try.  I took a bite and was thoroughly disappointed.  It was bland and had that dreaded "cardboard" texture to it....damn!  Strike 2!\u000a\u000aI paid my bill and left disappointed.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 30%......I might come back to shoot some pool and have drinks with friends.  For the food....probably not.

VStayed here for a few days.....the place is great.  Here's what I liked:\u000a\u000a+ Complimentary Continental Breakfast.\u000a\u000a+ Large, spacious suites.\u000a\u000a+ Full kitchen and they provide utensils and cookware on request at no additional charge.\u000a\u000a+ Nice access to restaurants within walking distance.\u000a\u000a+ Pillows are unbelievably soft....I wish I could take them home!\u000a\u000a+ Bath & Body bathroom amenities are very nice....the bar of soap is larger than most hotels.\u000a\u000a+ They have on site, self serve laundry machines in case you need it.\u000a\u000a+ FREE WiFi.\u000a\u000aAs you can see, there's a lot to like about the place.  It's an older property, but well kept.....if you're into the newer designed hotels, this might not be for you.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a nice stay.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VSome colleagues invited me for lunch the other day and decided to pick this place.  It was my first visit.  After browsing the menu for a few minutes, I decided to order the California Wrap (Spinach, Tomatoes, Avocado, Feta Cheese, Sun-Dried Tomato Vinaigrette Dressing, Tomato Basil Tortilla, $8.95) with a side of Cole Slaw & Iced Tea.\u000a\u000aI took one bite out of the California Wrap and was in Heaven!!!  The sweet flavor of Sun-Dried Tomato Vinaigrette Dressing was a perfect compliment to the Feta Cheese & Avocado....the Cole Slaw was amazing too!  What a great combo!\u000a\u000aThe only knock on this experience is that the service was kind of slow.  We had to constantly look for our waiter....to order.....to ask for extra napkins.....to get refills....to get our check.  Maybe we caught him on a bad day?  Because I enjoyed my meal so much, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 92%

VTime for a review update.  In addition to the comments on my prior review, they've remodeled the pool area and it's a much nicer place to be during the Summer.  The dining here is great too.....we come by for business lunches at SWB from time to time and the Italian joint, Alto, is great for dinner.\u000a\u000aThe lobby lounge is one of our regular stops during the year for the Jazz music. Keep it up guys!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VI tried to take the family here for dinner 3 times.  Each time, we were told the wait was 30+ minutes.  Since I hate waiting and they don't take reservations, we passed and went somewhere else.  On the 4th attempt, The Better Half went ahead of time to put our name on the list so that I could join them later when we got seated....it worked perfectly.  I was in a business meeting and she timed it perfectly so that I was able to make it right after my meeting.\u000a\u000aWe ordered:\u000a\u000aAppetizers\u000aSpinach Artichoke Dip\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=kmUXZrIRtqqJbOxfJeksrw\u000aSweet Potato Fries\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=0FNCsaKdjoPOayWsFC8x5w\u000a\u000aPizzas\u000a10" Thin Crust - Onions, Green Peppers, Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Jalapenos, Mushrooms, Gorgonzola Cheese\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=dD0jzKpj2Oh-eaE7sVvLZw\u000a8" Thick Crust - Pepperoni, Sausage\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=VxSsA7mn7xU0QCmvjHrfUg\u000a10" Thick Crust - Anchovies, Mushrooms, Gorgonzola Cheese, Onions\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=HOLWbqCsw7-cPBoyFTY19Q\u000a\u000aYeah....we were hungry!  We ordered too much food and had to take a lot of it home.\u000a\u000aThe Pizzas were cooked well done, per our request.  We enjoy well done Pizza.  Because the ingredients are fresh, it took 45 minutes for the Pizzas to come out.  I had the Thin Crust.  After such a long wait, I had high expectations....unfortunately, I was disappointed.  It was just OK.  The Crust didn't have much flavor and the ingredients, while fresh, didn't hit my taste buds on a positive note.....damn.\u000a\u000aThe rest of the family felt the same way about their Pizzas.  Kiddo had the Thick Crust Pepperoni & Sausage....he too is a Pizza lover like me and he said his was just OK.  Mom & The Better Half had the other Pizza and they too were underwhelmed.\u000a\u000aThe Appetizers were the highlight of the evening.  The Spinach Artichoke Dip was delish & the Sweet Potato Fries were awesome.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was an average dining experience.  Was it worth the long wait to get in, then the long wait to get your Pizza?  No.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 10%

VTime for a review update.  This store is very convenient for us to do some last minute shopping when we need to pick up outdoor gear, household items, or random stuff you can't find in smaller stores.\u000a\u000aI wouldn't say we're regular patrons of this store, but we know that we can count on this place when we're looking for most items we can't find.\u000a\u000aIt's not as busy as most Walmarts, so that's a big plus.  Also, they had some ammo here....but that didn't last long, it was gone in 1 day....but at least they had some.\u000a\u000aWill be back from time to time.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

VConveniently located near my house, I fill up here all the time.  Space is tight here to fill up for gas.  The lanes are narrow and the landscaping and curbing of the shopping center makes it tough to get in/out of the gas lanes when it's busy.\u000a\u000aHowever, the convenience store rocks.  There's a big, walk-in beer cooler to grab supplies on game days.  They also have a decent selection of Wine when you're in a pinch....and it's not priced that bad either.

They're so close to one another that if I drive through Costco's parking lot and see a nightmare of cars there....I drive 2 min to this store and shop.\u000a\u000aThey keep the store clean and organized well.

Because over the past few years I've visited this place it's been really inconvenient to get a car wash and gas.  \u000a\u000aThe place is always super busy because it's located near a busy intersection.  That means that the lanes are crowded and the lines can get long for the car wash.

VHad a few haircuts here.  The salon is kind of small with the registration desk/cashier tucked on the right side of the salon from the entrance.  It's kind of weird because the people waiting for their appointment can watch you if you're stylist is in the 1st row of stations on the left.  I got a decent cut there but my stylist had one of those stations and I don't like having a bunch of strangers watching me get a haircut.\u000a\u000aAlso, the small shopping center where it's located can be tight for parking.

VAfter having some Baja Fresh at the San Diego Airport on a recent trip, I was in the mood to have it again, so I stopped by this location.

I wasn't too impressed with it.  It has a lot of potential, but just didn't seem to be as tasty as I had imagined.

VTime for a review update.  After we moved to the area a few years ago, this location is the closest to my neighborhood.  From the first time I dined here until today, it's delivered consistent food quality and customer service.\u000a\u000aThe lines can get long during the lunch rush, so I like to come here before 11 am or after 1 pm to beat the long lines.  The only downside to this restaurant is the parking situation.  The parking lot of the shopping center it's located in gets packed, so it's often difficult to find a space close to the restaurant.  That sucks when it's 110 degrees out in the middle of the Summer.  Despite that inconvenience, I still come back.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 85%

VWow, it's time to update this review.  Since I moved to the area, KO's has been one of our regular watering holes.  We absolutely love this place.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a+ Friendly staff.  The bartenders, servers, and managers are super friendly and always stop by to say hello at our table.\u000a\u000a+ The food.  Pizza, Wings, Sandwiches, Burgers....we've had so many things on the menu, It's hard to figure out which one is our favorite.  If I had to pick a couple, it would be the Fuh-getta-bout-it Pizza and the Turkey Bacon Melt.....seriously though, the food is superb.\u000a\u000a+ They have a cool patio area.  There's a large AC unit out back and misters to keep you cool during the summer months and a heater to keep you warm during the winter.  The patio is the place to be sometimes.\u000a\u000a+ The offer a complimentary shuttle to drive you home.  Don't want to drive?  No problem, call up KO's to pick you up.  Had a little too much to drink and don't want a DUI?  No problem, ask them to take you home and they'll do it free of charge.  There's of course a radius of how far they'll drive, but if you live nearby you're in the zone.\u000a\u000aOverall, this is a solid bar that we love coming to on a regular basis.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VI've passed this place several times and it's always jam packed and difficult to find parking, so I when I saw that it wasn't too busy one night, I stopped by.  After browsing the menu, I decided to get a Popper Burger (Sauteed Jalapenos, Onion Straws, Cream Cheese, $9.50) and to wash it down a Four Peaks IPA.\u000a\u000aThe Burger didn't disappoint, it was very good!  The combination of Jalapenos & Cream Cheese made this Burger unique and tasty.....with a little *kick*, just how I like it.  The Four Peaks IPA was a perfect match for it as well....yum!\u000a\u000aI sat at the bar and the bartender/server was very friendly and helpful.  Can't wait to come back.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 97%

When I played, we saw a Bobcat, Coyote, and Hawk.\u000a+ The course is challenging, but fun for all handicaps.\u000a\u000aOverall, despite shooting poorly, I enjoyed the golf outing.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VEasily one of my favorite golf courses in Arizona, Troon North is a blast.  The course is modern, well designed, and well kept.  I've played in several charity tournaments here and personal rounds of golf with friends and colleagues.  The Monument Course is my fav of the two.  Very picturesque and full of wildlife.  We've seen rattlesnakes, hawks, rabbits, coyotes, roadrunners, various types of birds, and bobcats while on the golf course....amazing!\u000a\u000aThe clubhouse meeting room is kind of small though.  Post tournament lunches and ceremonies are kind of cramped.  Parking can get tight if the tournament is large and well attended, so get there early if you're playing in a tourney.\u000a\u000aIn the summertime, it's blazing hot and it's a desert course, so not much shade to cool off at on the tee box.\u000a\u000aStaff here is always friendly and professional.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VThis is a gem of a resort.  Tucked away in the foothills at Troon North, this resort is top notch.  It deserves it's AAA 5 Diamond rating.  Every time I've been here, the service is top notch.  Every employee from the valet staff when we arrive, to the bus person at the restaurant understands how to provide guests with 5 Diamond service.\u000a\u000aI've had the pleasure of being a guest here when a few friends from out of town stayed here over the summer.  We were able to join them for an evening by snatching a low summer rate.  Although it was only 1 night, we were very relaxed and felt like we were 1000 miles away from Phoenix.  The rooms are spectacular with premium amenities.\u000a\u000aIn addition to staying here, I come here for lunch from time to time with colleagues.  The food in all of their restaurants is amazing.  They also recently launched a food truck, yep a food truck!\u000a\u000aOverall, this is one of Scottsdale's best resorts.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VI'm not a camper.  So when I was invited to go on a 4 day camping trip, I stopped by REI to help me out.\u000a\u000aThe sales staff here we extremely helpful.  Since I never camp, they suggested that I rent the equipment.  They set me up with a tent, sleeping bag, and pad.  It was perfect.  I paid for my equipment 2 months ahead of time, then picked it up the day before we left on our trip and returned it the day after I returned.  When you rent equipment, you only pay for the days of your trip, not for the pickup/return days.\u000a\u000aBy renting instead of buying, I was able to save hundreds of dollars.\u000a\u000aThanks REI!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100% If I go camping again...

VThis review is only for their banquet staff and meeting space.  I participated in a golf tournament recently and the pairings party and post-golf awards luncheon was held in the ballroom of this hotel.  Both events were executed well.\u000a\u000aThe food was very good and fresh.  For both events, it was served banquet style with carving stations for the meat and live cooking stations for the pasta....very cool.\u000a\u000aThe VIP media reception in the pre-function area was a little crowded.  There was around 100 to 150 people there for that and I think the space can only handle about 100 max...it was a little uncomfortable.  However, the wait staff serving passed hors d'oeuvres handled it well.  The hosted bars were serving high quality Wine, Beer, and Liquor and the bartenders were great.\u000a\u000aOverall, I was impressed with their ability to put on a high quality event.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VStopped by this Subway on the drive back home to Vegas from Phoenix.  It is conveniently located on the right side of the road heading to Vegas.\u000a\u000aI ordered a 6" BMT w/Jalapeno Cheddar Bread & had it toasted.  I added Tomatoes, Lettuce, Green Peppers, Pepperoncinis, Mustard, Mayo, Oil, Vinegar, Salt, Pepper.  They made it quickly and I was eating in no time.\u000a\u000aThe ingredients were very fresh and the Sandwich tasted great.  A nice snack for the ride home.\u000a\u000aA bonus is the clean restrooms....a quick tip is to stop here to use the restroom instead of a nasty gas station....every gas station in Wickenberg was busy with travelers using the restrooms.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Next time I drive to/from Phoenix, I will.

VThis sister course to Rhodes Ranch, this golf course is tucked near Lake Las Vegas.  Thankfully, it hasn't suffered the same fate as the Lake Las Vegas courses....it's managed to stay open during the recession.\u000a\u000aHere are my thoughts on this course:\u000a\u000aPros\u000a- It's both a fun and challenging course.  The fairways aren't too tight, but some holes have the appearance as if they are narrower than they actually are.\u000a\u000a- The course is in good shape most of the time.\u000a\u000a- The rates are great for the type of golf course you get to play on.\u000a\u000aCons\u000a- It's location is far from my house & the Strip.  Unless you live in Green Valley or Henderson, it's a drive.\u000a\u000a- There is no permanent clubhouse.  Unfortunately, it never got completed.  There were plans to do it, but with the economy tanking, it's on hold for a while I'm sure.\u000a\u000a- Because there isn't a permanent clubhouse, the food is served out of a snack bar type restaurant.....the food quality isn't good.\u000a\u000a- The driving range can get cramped, especially if there are lessons being held and it's the weekend.\u000a\u000aOverall, I rate this place 3 Stars....if they had a permanent facility and better food, I might bump it up to 4 Stars.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Next time I feel like driving to Egypt to play golf, sure.

VEvery once in a while I'll meet my Henderson friends here for a drink or three.  We enjoy meeting here because it's a fun place to meetup.  We'll head to one of the bars and have a Beer and for the gamblers in the group, they enjoy the huge selection of Video Poker machines offered.\u000a\u000aSince I don't gamble, I stick around the bar area and people watch....good times.\u000a\u000aThe casino is always kept clean and the employees are mostly friendly.  The only thing I don't like is parking....I prefer the parking garage in the back of the property rather than the surface lot, which seems to be a magnet for road ragers.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 40%.....only because I live on the other side of town.

VThis place has really gone downhill over the past few years.  It use to be one of my favorite local places to hangout and grab a bite to eat or drink.....now, it's just a shell of it's former self and dirty.  The clientele has declined as well.....I wasn't feeling to safe leaving the casino at 11 o'clock at night.  I only come here now to see a concert.  They occasionally get some good, talented performers in their small showroom....which is what kept me from giving them 2 Stars.  In the past I've seen Ottmar Liebert perform in that showroom.....to see him up close and personal like that was amazing.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Only if they book a good act.

VMy Son and I were in the area volunteering at Three Square and decided to stop by here during our lunch break.  The parking lot was packed and we had to wait around 10 min for our table....this was at 12:10 pm, the worst time to be heading to lunch.  The wait was worth it though.\u000a\u000aOnce we were seated we browsed the menu and decided to order the Queso Fundido w/Chorizo appetizer ($6.95), Beef & Bean Chimichanga lunch special ($8.25), and Pollo Amador lunch special ($10.25).  I also asked the waiter if the cook could put together a really spicy Habanero Salsa for us....he said sure.  \u000a\u000aWe were served complimentary Chips, Salsa, and Beans while we waited for our food....+1.  The Salsa reminded me of the Salsa at Lindo/Bonito Michoacan.  I read the menu that had the story of Zapata, but couldn't find any connection between the restaurants.....the Salsa was that close to one another.  Anyway, it was really good.....had a nice kick to it.  The Chips weren't as fresh as I like them to be....but they were good.\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait our Queso Fundido came out....again, it reminded me of the one at Lindo/Bonito Michoacan.  It was very delicious.  On top of the dish is an extremely hot Pepper....I think it's a grilled Jalapeno or Poblano (see pics)....whatever it is, I like it.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Beef & Bean Chimichanga and it came out a few minutes later....along with the Habanero Salsa.  The Beef was shredded and very delicious, not greasy.  Sometimes when you order a Beef Chimichanga it can be very greasy....not here.  It was a nice size too.....must be their lunch portion.  The Habanero Salsa was really spicy....just how I like it!  It added to the flavor.  My dish also came with Guacamole & Sour Cream and a side of Refried Beans & Rice.....all very good.\u000a\u000aMy Son enjoyed his Pollo Amador.  He gave me a bite to try it out.  It is Chicken marinated in Amador Sauce (whatever that is).  The Sauce had a slightly sweet tomatoey flavor to it.....it was very good.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a nice lunch.\u000a\u000aWill we return?  If we're in the area and in the mood for some Mexican Food....you can count on it.

VThis is a very challenging golf course.  Set in the hills of Green Valley, this desert course requires that you are not only a long ball hitter, but an accurate one at that.\u000a\u000aI would not recommend this golf course to the average or high handicap golfer, it will only frustrate you.  The views of the valley are spectacular and if you are into it they offer "Tee Mates", which are "good looking" women who you can pay an extra fee for them to ride around with you during your round....they will replace divots, tee up your ball, fix ball marks, and tend the pin.  I've never used that service as I find it distracting and a waste of money.  However, if that's what floats your boat, it's available.....just remember that you have to pay extra for it and reserve them ahead of time.\u000a\u000aThe course itself is kept in great condition all year round.  The fees are above average for a Vegas golf course, but you get to play a fantastic course for your money.\u000a\u000aI've played here a few times, but not enough to have favorite holes.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I will eventually, it's a good course.

VI recently attended a funeral for a close friend's family member at this church.  I wish the visit was under better circumstances, but such is life.  The church is very new and I'm not sure if this is the permanent location.....the floors were concrete and the chairs didn't look permanent.  The decor is very nice and the priest and church staff who conducted the services were very professional and helped the family through this tough time.  My friend was very pleased with how everything went....it allowed him and his family to grieve in peace.\u000a\u000aWould like to come back here for a normal Mass Service someday.  There's plenty of parking and the parking spaces are wide....there's nothing worse than the traffic jam after Sunday service at some of the other churches in town....it's like people forget about what just happened and drive like maniacs in the parking lot.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VFriends from So Cal were visiting and wanted to come here.  One of them is a FOB Vietnamese (she calls herself that!) and has dined here before.  Her boyfriend also loves the place and so do I, so we had lunch yesterday.\u000a\u000aI had the Beef Fried Rice, she had I the Sweet & Sour Pork Chops, and I don't know what her boyfriend had, but it looked good.  All of the dishes were excellent.  We didn't leave hungry, that's for sure!\u000a\u000aThe only strike against this place is that the servers here seem so unfriendly.  They don't say hello, have a mean look on their face all the time, and when my friend asked for chopsticks, the server gave her a mean look and pointed to the chopsticks on the table....she obviously didn't see it, but it was the way he handled it that was shocking.  The funny part is that she's Vietnamese, so you would think they would treat Gringo's like that, but not their own....whatever.  They only get 3 Stars because of the service.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Pho-gettah 'bout it, of course!

VNot much as changed since I wrote my first review over 3 yrs ago.  Many visits later...the food has been solid....some of the best Pho in Vegas.  However, the service here is still weird....servers are still miserable and unfriendly...I've come to accept it as fact that they don't like us because we're not Vietnamese.  Combine that with all of the drunks that come in here during the late night and early morning hours and they have a generally bad disposition to outsiders coming to eat here.  It's become part of the lore that is Pho Kim Long....at least amongst our friends.\u000a\u000aMy fav dish here is the Beef Combo Pho....so good, I can eat it morning/noon/night...yum!\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pho-kim-long-las-vegas?select=Ol7fB974HymWXQ78uFPANQ#Ol7fB974HymWXQ78uFPANQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pho-kim-long-las-vegas?select=ruo_rjf7rAcCUu3jPKb3bw#ruo_rjf7rAcCUu3jPKb3bw\u000a\u000aAs long as they keep serving up great Pho, I'll be back.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 98%

VPawn shops are a lot of fun to shop at, especially for jewelry.  This location is my favorite for looking for deals on jewelry.  It has one of the largest and best selection of jewelry in town.\u000a\u000aI like to come here at least every 2 or 3 months to see if there are any new pieces.  It can get really busy, so be patient.  It's best if you find a salesperson you like working with.  Over the years we've worked with a couple of people and one of them has my cell and will call me if an item of interest pops into the store....it's like having a personal shopping assistant.  Not too many people will do that for you.....she happens to do it because we've purchased a lot from her over the years and she works on commission....\u000a\u000aOverall, great place.....service is hit or miss.\u000a\u000aSome general tips.....\u000a\u000a- Don't bring too much cash.....for your own safety.\u000a\u000a- It gets very busy on holidays, but if you get there a week or two before a holiday like Christmas or Valentine's Day, you can find some good stuff.\u000a\u000a- Ask the salesperson if there's anything kept "in the back"......for instance, most good Rolex watches and other collectible time pieces are not out on display.....you might see one or two, but the best stuff is 'hidden".\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VAll of the same things I wrote 2 yrs ago still apply here.  Great spot with a great selection of jewelry and watches.  Service is still spotty, but if you happen to be there when Ladera is working, she'll take good care of you.  She's very friendly and knowledgable about the items in the store.  She will also check for you if there's any room for negotiation.  Other than that her, most of the other people who work here are not as friendly.\u000a\u000a4 Stars for product offering, 2 Stars for spotty service.  Ladera gets a solid 4 Stars.  This is still on my rotation of shops to visit when I'm back in Vegas.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VI absolutely love this place.  I've been eating here since it was down the street a little bit in a small 10 table shop.  Another one of my favorites for lunch.  I eat there at least once a month.\u000a\u000aMy favorite dishes are:\u000aGarlic Knots - A must have for anyone who eats here.  Think pizza dough with butter and garlic tied into a knot.\u000aPizza - I like the 2 slice cheese lunch special when I'm in a hurry.\u000aBaked Ziti - Unbelievably good.....large serving.  I definitely need a nap after eating this dish.\u000a\u000aI take clients and friends here whenever possible.

VOnce upon a time I was a huge fan of this Baja Fresh location.  My coworkers and I  use to come here all the time for lunch.  Then, about 4 yrs ago I noticed a rapid decline in their food quality.  Their Chips started to become thinner and not so fresh.  Their Beef didn't taste as good.  And when they started posting nutritional info online.....I was afraid, very afraid.    Most of my favorite dishes here had a gazillion calories!  Oh no!\u000a\u000aWell, every once in a while I'll visit an old friend and have a Beef Burrito.  Was at this location recently and enjoyed one for lunch.  Nothing special though.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Possibly.

This is the center of the Art Universe in Las Vegas.\u000a\u000aI'm glad it's here and I will always support it when I can.  Today I went to Beerfest, which was a great event and I had a lot of great tasting beers.  My favorites were the IPA's from Tenaya Creek and Joseph James brewery.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet!

VWhat can I say about the Art Factory....well:\u000a\u000aI LOVE....\u000a- How they have events such as First Friday and the Beerfest in July.\u000a- How they feature local artists.\u000a- How eclectic and diverse the art that's on display.\u000a- How it brings locals together for good times.\u000a\u000aI HATE...\u000a- Parking....it's always a giant mess for big events.\u000a- The location....when it gets busy, it can get squirrely on the roads around the building and people don't pay attention....it's a fender bender waiting to happen.\u000a\u000aSo, I guess when you weigh all those factors, I give it 4 Stars.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  For the next fun event, sure!

VFor those of you who don't live in Vegas, this is the company that picks up your trash and recycled items.  In the 17+ years I've lived here, they only get 3 Stars from me.  Here's why:\u000a\u000aPROS\u000a- They pick up trash on holidays.\u000a\u000a- They never miss a scheduled pickup day.\u000a\u000a- They will pickup trash up to 6 feet long.\u000a\u000aCONS\u000a- They pick up the recycled items later in the day, which can make the neighborhood messy if it's a windy day.\u000a\u000a- They always leave the trash can in the street instead of near the sidewalk.  Sometimes, they leave the trashcan at the neighbor's house next door.\u000a\u000a- They sometimes leave some trash in the can.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's not bad.....bottom line, there's no other option, so I'll have to live with it!  Thanks @Misti Y for the inspiration to review the trash guys!

VOne of my "Go To" places for Vitamins.  Yeah, they're kind of high priced at times, but they have a clearance rack that has great deals....anywhere from $1 to $5 for various supplements & vitamins that are normally 5-10x that price.  I also get BOGO (Buy 1 Get 1 Free) coupons in the mail every month, bonus!\u000a\u000aThey have a good selection of vitamins....only the really rare, hard to find herbal supplements are difficult to find here.\u000a\u000aTheir staff is always friendly.  They crack me up whenever they ask me if I have a membership card.  I was born on Guam and have an unusual last name.....everyone who works at this place is either Filipino or Guamanian, so when they find out what my last name is, they ask if I'm related to someone they know, hilarious.  It happened today when I was there and happens every time....you'd think they'd know by now!  Only one girl who sees me all the time remembers that I'm probably not related to him.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a great shopping experience there.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet!

VOk, this store has a great selection of products.....however, the service here sucks, which is why I gave it 2 Stars.  I would have given it 1 Star but the selection of products bumped it up to 2 Stars.\u000a\u000aWas shopping with my son for a pair of shoes and had to ask for assistance.  There were 3 people working within 10 feet of us and none of them came up to ask us if we needed any help.  Meanwhile, my son was trying on shoe after shoe.....he tried over 10 pairs of shoes and still no help from anyone.\u000a\u000aWe finally found a pair he liked and went to pay for it.  It was about 30 minutes until closing and there was a line of about 20 people and 4 cashiers.  When we got to the front of the line, I could hear one of the cashiers say really loud to another...."Damn, where the hell did all this customers come from?!  Don't they have better things to do?".....now, she said this with contempt in her voice.  Clearly she wanted to go home right at closing, but with a store full of customers and a long line of PAYING customers, it was cutting into her free time.\u000a\u000aThat comment made me sick......in today's economy, she should be happy that they had a long line of people at the cash register!  Ungrateful.....she doesn't understand the value of a customer.\u000a\u000aBased on her comments & the lack of customer service from the 3 lazy people who was near us and didn't offer help.....I've determined that it's not a one-off situation, but a regular problem with this store.  Clearly they don't know how to service customers.\u000a\u000aI wish my son would have found something he wanted at the Adidas store....they were very friendly and helpful.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  ~with a frustrated voice~ Only because there aren't more options for Nike Outlet Stores.....just the one on the South End of the Strip, which is inconvenient for me.

VSince we moved out of town, we don't shop here as much as when we were Vegas locals.  However, since it's so big and oftentimes has great prices on shoes and clothing, we pop in from time to time when we're in town.  I've found some great deals on shoes at this location.  My Son loves coming here too.\u000a\u000aThe customer service has improved since my last review over 3 yrs ago.  They must've cleaned house or those bad employees quit.  Either way, I'm happy to see the improvement.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 65%

VThis review is for their internet services only.  I've been using Cox High Speed internet ever since they started offering it in the late 90's.  It is by far the best internet connection you can buy.\u000a\u000aI've kept my high speed connection the past decade while I tried and compared it to DSL, Satellite, and Clear.....none of those can come close to the upload/download speeds that Cox provides.  I have the Premier Internet plan (20 Mbps download & 2 Mbps upload, $59.99) and it's blazing fast.\u000a\u000aThere is an occasional issue with connectivity or the modem, but I've found their customer service to be adequate.  Since I'm an above average user of computers, it is very easy for me to diagnose the problem with their customer support phone staff.\u000a\u000aMany years ago I also had cable TV service with Cox.....but I hated it, so I dumped them in favor of Direct TV back in 2002.  However, when it comes to internet connectivity, Cox wins by a mile.\u000a\u000aUnless someone comes up with a more reliable, faster internet connection, I won't leave them.

VCame here to shop for a pair of shoes for my son.  We didn't find anything that he liked but the customer service here was excellent.  When we walked into the store, we were welcomed by a cashier who had a huge line of people.  Then while we were browsing the aisles there were several salespersons who approached us and asked us if we needed assistance.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a nice shopping experience.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Absolutely....maybe next time we'll find something we like.

VWhen I shop for shoes, I like to make a stop by this store.  They have a decent selection of basic dress and athletic shoes.  They won't have the most stylish or designer brands, but if you're looking for an everyday shoe, this store will do the trick.\u000a\u000aI've found some decent Florsheim wing tips here in the past.  My most recent visit this past weekend was a bust....but what I like about this store is that the employees are willing to check in the back to see if they have your size.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Sure.

VOver the past 3 years we've bought a few pieces for our house here.  There's always a decent selection of furniture and home decor in the store.  I recommend stopping by every 6 months or so to see what they have.\u000a\u000aI recently stopped by to see if there was anything I could find for The Better Half for Christmas.....didn't find anything but saw a lot of interesting pieces.....there was a C3PO robot and 2 Pirates (see pics)....I'd love to get them for the house, but The Better Half would kill me.  They'd make great conversation pieces though...LOL\u000a\u000aThe sales people here can be a bit pushy, but all you have to do is tell them you're there browsing and they'll leave you alone.  The prices are somewhat negotiable.....they'll consider most offers unless the person selling on consignment has a high floor price....then there's not much room for negotiation.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Like I said, I'm here every 6 months or so to see if I can find some cool stuff.

VWhen I go to Best Buy, I usually know what I'm looking for.  So I have no beef with the prices.  Also, since I do all tech support myself, I don't have a beef with the Geek Squad or warranty either.\u000a\u000aNow, this particular Best Buy is my least favorite in town because it's old and not as clean as the others, which is the reason for my 3 Stars.  The employees here are satisfactory, but not great.  The store serves it's purpose for my needs, which is to satisfy my fix for electronics immediately.  I normally buy electronics & computer equipment online because it's cheaper for the same products.....however, every once in a while I'll need to have my fix and if I'm not in the mood to drive to Fry's I'll stop by here.\u000a\u000aMy last visit, which was yesterday....my son was shopping for his 1st cell phone.  We went to take a look at various models from different companies.  One great thing about Best Buy is that they have all of the major cell companies under one roof so we don't have to drive all over Blazed Egypt to browse.  After screwing around the cell phone area we wandered over to the Xbox 360 aisles......yeah, I got Fuschnickened by my son into "taking a look" at some games......$100 bucks later I had to explain to wifey why we were coming home with video games after a cell phone expedition.  Plus, we ended up at Game Stop after this Best Buy trip.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  The next time I start shaking and need a new gadget....possibly.

VThis is one of my family's favorite restaurants.  We eat here at least once a month.\u000a\u000aFood - Some of our favorite dishes are the Pad Thai Tofu, Pad See Ew, Spicy Chicken Curry.  For appetizers, we enjoy the Sweet & Sour Cucumbers and the Edamame.  When you order your entree, you tell the waiter how spicy you want your food on a scale from 1-10 with 10 being the spiciest level.  I generally get a 5 or 6.\u000a\u000aService - The employee to customer ratio in this restaurant is pretty high.  My guess is that they don't make very much in terms of an hourly wage.  Either way, the service is always good.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet!

VOk, so I was in the mood for authentic Mexican food today and wanted to try something new....so I headed towards the hood.  I figured I'd find something good there.\u000a\u000aAs I passed by Pepe's, I've seen this place a 1000 times since I've lived in Vegas, but never stopped.  I did today.\u000a\u000aIt was pretty busy in the restaurant and I was glad to see a typical menu for a taco shop....reminds me of when I lived in SoCal.  I ordered a Carne Asada Burrito and a bottle of Mexican Orange Soda....I love their soda because it's made with Natural Sugar and not High Fructose Corn Syrup.\u000a\u000aAnyway, my burrito came out and I was pleased to see it was a good size...not too big and not too small.  I went to the salsa bar and got some of their spicy red salsa.  The burrito was ok....I thought the Carne Asada was too salty, but it had good flavor....the beans were good....the rice was dry....and the salsa in the burrito was ok.\u000a\u000aOverall, the experience didn't blow me away.  It was a good visit, but not the one I was hoping for.  I guess next time, I'll have to go deeper into the hood.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  eh...not sure.

VDespite being the closest Walmart to my house, I don't come here very often.  It's dirty and old.  I remember coming here when I first moved here over 17 yrs ago.  It was decent back then.  Now, it's tired and worn down.  \u000a\u000aI usually go to the Walmart in Centennial, which is a much larger, newer, and cleaner Walmart.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Reluctantly, I'm sure I will because it's close and sometimes I'm too lazy to make the drive.

The guy didn't long haul me either, so I was really impressed with that.\u000a\u000aThe only thing that kept them from 4 Stars is that the cab smelled like dirty socks and the interior was dirty.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VI like shopping at Von's.  Most of their stores in the Vegas Valley are clean and carry a good selection of items.\u000a\u000aOn our last visit to this store, we waited for 10 minutes at the meat counter and nobody helped us....this knocked a Star off otherwise it would have been 4 Stars.\u000a\u000aThe deli has a good selection of meats & cheeses.  The bread selection here is good too.  I wish it was closer to my house.  I only shop here when I happen to be in the neighborhood.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Yes.

VOne of my all time favorites.....we love going to this place.  We have several favorite restaurants that we go to on a regular basis and this is one of them.  We like the atmosphere....it reminds me a lot of the restaurants on the East Coast or in Chicago....dark, brick walls, etc.  The wine selection is great.....we usually do a wine tasting of Chardonnay (fiance) and Cabernet (for me) along with dinner.  \u000a\u000aThe prices are very reasonable and the outdoor patio seating is a great option during the Spring/Fall.  Winter and Summer can be a little uncomfortable.  I definitely recommend reservations as the wait can be long and there isn't much room for waiting around near the bar or hostess stand.  Our favorite dishes there are the appetizer sampler and the bowtie pasta w/chicken breast.  Very fun and moderate on the budget.

V***This review is for the bar counter service only***\u000a\u000aThis is a really hard review for me to write....why?  Because I love this place, but last night the service was so bad I have to give it 2 Stars.\u000a\u000aThe Better Half and I enjoy going out to places that offer flights of wine.  We enjoy sampling different vineyards without the cost of paying for a full glass of wine.  Grape Street is our go to place for this.  Normally we dine at a table and enjoy a full meal with our flights.  However, last night we decided to go to the bar because we didn't plan to eat.  It was a mistake.\u000a\u000aThe bartender's service was horrible.  We had to get our own menus.  We each ordered a flight of the Zinfandels and glasses of water.  Once she poured the flights of wine, she didn't bother to tell us anything about the wine.  Normally, they will tell you which glass contains which wine and will give you a brief description of the taste & flavors.  She was more concerned with this guy who was sitting at the bar.  Keep in mind that there was only 5 people at the bar including my Wife & I when we arrived.  Within 20 minutes, there was only 3 of us remaining at the bar.....she spent all of her time chatting up the other customer.  Meanwhile, our glasses of water sat empty.\u000a\u000aI finished my flight before the Better Half finished hers.....that's always the case.  I was interested in having another glass and was considering one of the Cabs....however, she was nowhere to be found.  The bar was left unattended and who knows where she went.  Finally, she appeared with food for the other customer.  I waited until she delivered his order, then I flagged her down....she says "Just one second".....then she bolts from the bar.....what the ??  I watched her as she walked around the restaurant and she came back empty handed.....what was so freaking important that you couldn't take a drink order from a customer at the bar?  \u000a\u000aWhen she finally came over, I asked if I could sample one of the Cabs before I made my decision......she said "sure" and poured me a small sample of the Cab I requested.  Then, she walked away to do something else in the back.....didn't she want to know if I wanted to order a full glass?  Come on!  By this time, the Better Half said screw this.....let's go have a glass of wine somewhere else where we will be served.\u000a\u000aA server from the restaurant came to the bar, looked over at us and could see we were irritated....asked if we needed anything, I said Check Please.  She went in the back and found the bartender....who came over and said "Didn't you want another glass of wine?"......ha, not tonight and not with your crappy service.  I paid the check and we were on our way to another place.\u000a\u000aI didn't get the bartender's name, but she had dirty blond curly hair.....I remember who she is because when we come back, I will be sure to avoid the bar if she's working.\u000a\u000aThis place use to be so much better than this.  I don't know what's going on.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Yes, but will only sit at the bar if she's not the bartender.  We'll sit in the dining area if necessary.

I was right!\u000a\u000aI ordered a Steak Burrito w/Pinto Beans ($6.29).  It came out shortly and I went to the Salsa Bar to get their Spicy Salsa....it has some pretty good heat and I enjoy the flavor a lot.  The Burrito was very good and satisfying.\u000a\u000aI'm glad I found this chain and that there's one near my house!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VStopped by this Starbucks after a lunch at Northside Nathan's Pizza which is a few doors down.  I enjoy coming to Starbucks to study and get some work done.  The FREE Wifi is a big plus for me.\u000a\u000aAlthough I've been to this Starbucks before, it was the first time I've been here to study and work.  I like how they still serve Decaf after 1 pm....when most Starbucks in Vegas stop brewing it at 1 pm for some reason.  I like my Half-Caf.....and can't do full blown Caffeinated Starbucks.  I like how their FREE Wifi gave me no problems, it was fast and I stayed connected for over 2 hours....unlike some other Starbucks where the connection sucks.\u000a\u000aI didn't like the arrangement of the furniture.  Although the chair I was sitting in was plush and comfy, the atmosphere didn't feel comfortable to me.....maybe it's the Feng Shui of the joint.  I don't have a clue about Feng Shui, but something just doesn't feel right in this place and I don't know how to explain it....which is too bad.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  For the Half-Caf, yes.....to Study/Work, no.

VI absolutely love Trader Joe's.  They always have great products at reasonable prices.  I was there today and picked up a bunch of good stuff.  I recently tried their Whole Grain Flatbread and made some Flatbread Mexican Pizzas & Grilled Cheese with it....yum!\u000a\u000aSome other stuff I buy regularly here:\u000a\u000aTable Wine - This is a great place to pick up everyday table wine for less than $6.  It's hit or miss as far as the quality, but I've had a lot of success with their Argentinian Red Wine.\u000a\u000aBeer - Yes, I buy beer here on occasion.  Their Summer Brew is pretty good....and I just bought a couple of bottles of Chimay Tripel & Grand Reserve....yes!  Their Christmas Brew is awesome too.\u000a\u000aCereal - I'll pick up some flax & whole grain cereal and try the various flavors they offer.  Not my favorite cereal, but it changes it up a bit.\u000a\u000aChocolate - The Better Half loves Dark Chocolate.....and TJ always has a nice selection of Dark Chocolate to make her happy.\u000a\u000aDessert - Our family loves their Tiramisu Cake & Chocolate Ganache Torte.....fuggeta-bout it!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Oh yeah!

VJimmy John's....why did it take so long for me to find you?  I've heard so much about this place and for some reason have never eaten at one of there joints until the other day.\u000a\u000aAfter browsing the menu, I opted for a #5 Vito Italian Sandwich (Genoa Salami, Provolone, Capicola, Onion, Lettuce, Tomato & Italian Vinaigrette) and a bag of Jalapeno Chips & Soda.....another Soda Fountain got to me....they have Mello Yello Soda here....never tried it before, so I had to give it a shot.\u000a\u000aThe Sandwich was made really fast, they handed me the Sandwich while I was paying for the food....wow!  I anxiously unwrapped the Sandwich and was pleased to see a large Sandwich.  As soon as I took the first bite, I became an instant fan.  The Italian Bread was soft and was definitely the highlight of the Sandwich.  The Meats and toppings were very good too, but the Bread made this Sandwich special.  It was doughy and went well with the Meat, Italian Vinaigrette and Veggies.....it some ways it reminded me of the Subs/Grinders I've had on the East Coast.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You can count on it!

VHave been here at least 5 times since my last review.  Since then I've discovered the #9 Italian Club (Genoa Salami, Capicola, Smoked Ham, Provolone Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Mayo, Italian Vinagrette, $5.75) and add Hot Peppers $.25.\u000a\u000aI can't get over how fast they make Sandwiches here....seriously, it takes them like 1 to 2 minutes max.  The Italian Club Sandwich has become my new favorite......it's full of flavor and filling.  I love the Hot Peppers....wish I could buy them at the store to take home.  The proportion of meat, cheese, and ingredients is perfect.  This is becoming one of my favorite Sandwich joints.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VMy Mom spent a couple of days in this hospital when her blood sugar level dropped and she passed out and suffered a minor cut to her head.  It was a good thing it wasn't too serious of an injury and we were pleased with the level of service here.  Since she didn't have a prior condition of low blood sugar, it took a little while for the doctor to figure out what happened.\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, the nurses took care of her and kept her in good spirits. Despite the high cost of the treatment, Mom was happy that she was taken to this hospital and recommends it to others.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - I hope it's 0%, but if I needed it....100%.

VI needed to print and fax a document this morning so I stopped by this location instead of the one on North Durango since it's a little closer to my house....big mistake.\u000a\u000aThis location is 3x bigger than the one I normally use, but they didn't offer Self-Printing unless you rented a computer....what?  They had a sign over the copiers & printers that said "Self Service Copy and Print" (See pics).  When I asked the guy he said, "We don't offer that here, you have to rent a computer to self print"....when I told him the North Durango location offered it, he shrugged and said "Well, we don't here"......they why the hell do you have a sign that says you do??!!\u000a\u000aIn any case, I made him do it for me....bottom line I paid 22 cents to have 2 pages printed, where it would have cost me 30 cents per minute plus the printing costs for renting a computer.  I know it sounds petty, but when you expect a certain service and they pull a fast one on you like that it makes the business look petty.\u000a\u000aI then used the Self-Fax machine without any issues.  That's what prevented this from being a 1 Star review.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Me thinks not.

VThey say you should give a place a second chance....well, today I did.  I had a bad experience the last time I was at this location and swore I wouldn't return.  However, circumstances and my schedule found me at this location once again looking to get some printing done.\u000a\u000aAfter unsuccessfully trying their new Self-Printer, I asked for assistance.  A new employee eagerly helped me out, making sure I was taken care of and that I left happy.  Despite being new and not really understanding how to work certain computers and printers, she gave it a shot and was able to handle my requests in a quick and efficient manner.\u000a\u000aI'm glad I gave this place a second chance.  It always makes me feel good when I do and they come through.  I only gave it 3 Stars because the Self-Printer didn't work and charged my credit card for stuff that never printed.  The employee had to back out those charges and print it herself from her computer/printer.  I hope they work out the kinks.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Sure.

VStopped here as part of my Pizza Bender Tour 2011 Edition.  I live in the neighborhood, so it was only a matter of time before I gave it a try.  I was looking forward to have a couple of Slices of Pizza and was disappointed to find out they don't sell Pizza by the Slice.....Damn!\u000a\u000aI wasn't going to let that stop me though.....so I ordered a Personal Sausage Pizza "well done" and a 1/2 Hot Italian Hero (Salami, Mortadella, Ham, Melted Mozzarella, Lettuce, Tomato, Italian Dressing, $4.75).  It took about 15-20 minutes for the food to be prepared.  I went for the Hero first....it was served Hot and the Cheese was melted throughout the Sandwich.  What was odd was the Tomatoes and Lettuce looked like Salad thrown on the Sandwich....it looked out of place and promptly "fell" out of the Sandwich when I took the first bite.  It was very tasty, but I didn't like how the Italian Dressing was served on the side like a dipping Sauce.  Just a weird setup, but plenty of potential....3.5 Stars on the Sammy.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjHhb6lrJdOryY5Ao4pHOg?select=Iqzb-H48B0AgB0vX-tKhDg\u000a\u000aNext I went for the Pizza.....I took one bite and thought it might have been a bust....but it grew on me.  The Crust is chewy and the Tomato Sauce has an interesting flavor.....all I can say is that I wanted more and that's always a good thing....for now, I'll give it 3 Stars.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjHhb6lrJdOryY5Ao4pHOg?select=xHoP8sxg9hyWexhiY6x52A\u000a\u000aThe employees are really friendly too and I think it's family owned, which I love.  Overall, the joint gets 3 Stars and the Pizza will definitely get a 2nd try from me.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VI've eaten here many times and had the Pizza, which I rate 4 Stars.  However, this most recent visit I decided to try the Thunderbird Sandwich $8.35 (Baked Chicken Breast, Ham, Pepperoni, Cheese) w/Lettuce, Tomato, Fries on the side for an extra $1.00.\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait, they brought out the food.  The Sandwich was piping hot....and looked so good!  I had to let it cool off for a minute because I didn't want to burn the hell out of my tongue.  It cooled off and I took a bite....WOW!  The combination of Baked Chicken, Ham, and Pepperoni was amazing!  The sharp flavor of the Pepporoni complimented the slightly salted Ham and perfectly baked Chicken Breast.  The Cheese and the Bread put it over the top!\u000a\u000aThe Fries were pre-fab crinkle Fries and were nothing special....I'll pass on them next time.\u000a\u000aOverall, I was impressed by their Sandwich.  I already love their Pizza.  I would give them 4.5 Stars if I could.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  There are a bunch of other Sandwiches I want to try....hell yeah!

VSince Tenaya Creek Brewery doesn't serve food, we ordered delivery from Northside Nathan's, which is nearby.  After browsing the menu, we decided to get a Large 1/2 Guys & Dolls (Sausage, Pepperoni, Onions) & Veggetarian (Onions, Peppers, Mushrooms, Tomatoes, Olives).....$24.  They told us 45 min to 1 hour.....not bad during the Super Bowl.\u000a\u000aThe food didn't seem to take long to deliver.....we anxiously tore open the box and started to dive into it....it was very very good!  The crust is thick like Sicilian style Pizza and is fluffy and full of flavor.  The Pizza is square-cut and holds the toppings well on the crust.  It hit the spot!\u000a\u000aEasily one of my favorite Pizza & Sandwich joints in town.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VI've passed this place at least 100x and have never stopped to check it out.  Today I stopped for some lunch.  As I pulled up to the restaurant, I noticed the sign in front of the joint that said "2 Slices & Soda $5.95".....perfect!\u000a\u000aI asked the guy at the counter if the 2 Slice Special is more or less Pizza than a Personal 10" Pizza....he said the 2 Slice Special has more Pizza, so I went with it.  The special price is for Cheese only, to add more toppings it's $.50 ea, so I decided to add Pepperoni & Sausage to both slices.....total damage $6.95.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/SQ8Tkavc4TJj-2kanEDzLg?select=Z2zzt8zXaQBX8doxb9-58g\u000a\u000aI then grabbed a Soda out of the beverage cooler, they have Coke Zero, score!  I'm not much of a Soda drinker, but there are 4 Sodas I have a tough time saying no to.....Mexican Coke or Pepsi, Pepsi Max, and Coke Zero.  I swear they put liquid Crack in Coke Zero!\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait, my Pizza was ready.  The Crust is slightly thicker than a NY Style Pizza and you must fold the Pizza if you want to eat it properly, otherwise you'll have to use a knife and a fork....which is a Sin!  I took one bite and thought the Pizza was really good.  The Pepperoni was great, quality stuff.  The Sausage was pretty good, but not great......was missing "something".  The Pizza had the perfect proportion of ingredients.....the Cheese or Sauce didn't overwhelm the Pizza.....which is a common mistake at some Pizza joints.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/SQ8Tkavc4TJj-2kanEDzLg?select=wjkjIIETK87tO8549L0MaQ\u000a\u000aOverall, I thought it was really good Pizza.  I was left wanting more.....I could have easily eaten another 2 Slices......next time I'm ordering a Medium for myself...ha!\u000a\u000aI noticed their sign that said their Wings were Baked, not Fried.....heard from Matt S that it's some of the best Wings in town.....have to try that next time!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VThis location was the former official game day bar for my local Alumni Club.  Last season we watched all of the football games here on Saturday and had a section reserved for our group.  This year we changed locations because of logistics for people throughout the Valley.  \u000a\u000aI stopped in here for old time's sake on Saturday to watch a few games and enjoy a few Blue Moon's.  The place was busy but not too packed.  I wasn't very hungry, so I passed on food and just enjoyed my Blue Moon.  However, in the past I've enjoyed their Kobe Burger and Nachos.  Those 2 dishes stand out for me.\u000a\u000aThe service was great, as usual.  It's a very casual joint, so come here in your jersey and jeans to enjoy a few drinks and some grub.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You can count on it!

VHad a quick dinner the other night with my Son.  We had Big Fat Chicken Tacos ($2.29), Veggie Works Burrito ($2.49), Carne Asada Taco ($1.79), Pollo Asada Taco ($1.79), and a Classic Taco ($.99).  The food was fresh and tasted good....although I'd skip their Carne Asada and Pollo Asada Tacos....it's their attempt to be like a real taco shop....and it's not even close.\u000a\u000aIt's a typical Del Taco, not much else to say about it.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I probably will.

VCame here to watch the Super Bowl.  I was expecting the place to be packed, but there were only 10 people when I arrived at 2 pm.  By the time the game started, there were only 20 of us in the bar, perfect!  We saddled up to a table and had a fun time watching the game.  Here's what I ordered:\u000a\u000aTenaya Creek Hop Ride IPA 7.2% abv ($5)\u000a2 - Tenaya Creek Oatmeal Stout 5.2% abv ($8)\u000a2 - Big Dog's War Dog Imperial IPA 8.8% abv ($6)\u000aOld Jackalope Barley Wine 10.4% abv ($5)\u000a\u000aThe Beer was fantastic....every one of them were excellent.  The best part......my total bar tab was $24!!!!!  Yes, only $24 for all of that!  The bartenders were really cool and so was the other customers.\u000a\u000aThe only thing that could make it better is if they served food.....but that's ok, we ordered a Pizza from Northside Nathan's (separate review) and that was awesome too.\u000a\u000aOther misc info:\u000a\u000a- There are 2 pool tables.\u000a\u000a- There's a breathalyzer machine where you can check your drunkness....didn't use it, LOL.\u000a\u000a- There's a small patio....that would be great during the Spring/Fall months.  It was actually really nice the evening we were there but there wasn't a TV outside to watch the game, so we passed.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VI usually go to the Walgreens that's closer to my house, but today I was near this one and decided to stop by and pick up some Dove Dark Chocolate Candy for the Better Half.  It is her Birthday today and one of her favorite things is Dove Dark Chocolate.\u000a\u000aI can count on Walgreens to be able to provide me the awesomeness that will make me a hero for today.  Since she had to work on her Birthday, I thought I'd surprise her with some of these bad boys and another one of her favorites.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  To this location, only when I'm nearby.

VI take my car to get washed here every once in a while.  $6 for a basic car wash isn't bad.  This location has one of the full car wash machines not the little ones that are self service.  I always wanted to take pics while driving through a car wash, so....Action pics included above.\u000a\u000aSince there was some recent construction on the roads near our house, my Wife's car had some tar stains on the side panels.  After this wash, they were all gone.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet!

VHad to get a Smog Check & Oil Change for my car this week and decided to stop by Terrible's.  It was Saturday and very busy.  I thought I was going to be here for hours.\u000a\u000aThere were 2 cars ahead of me for the Smog Check and 6 cars waiting for an Oil Change.  Good thing I had my iPad with me.  I hunkered down for a long morning.\u000a\u000aI was pleasantly surprised when they called my name after 45 minutes!  That's right, it took no longer than 45 minutes to get both an Oil Change and Smog Check on a busy Saturday!  This place is great.  I've been here a few times for an Oil Change, but for some reason have ignored it for a while.....that won't happen again.\u000a\u000aThe price was right too....with the coupons I had, I paid $42 for everything....plus I get a FREE Car Wash too...Score!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet!

VThis is where I go to purchase 90% of the good liquor I drink.  Mr. Lee has built an empire based on liquor and the reason is because his stores are so Awesome!  Why?  Here's Why....\u000a\u000aPros\u000a- You can find just about anything you're looking for here....Wine, Beer, and Spirits from all over the world.  And if they don't have it, you can special order it.\u000a\u000a- If you pay cash, you get a better price.\u000a\u000a- They have Wine Spectator & Wine Enthusiast ratings on their better wines for reference.\u000a\u000a- Their prices are pretty competitive....can you find a bottle or two cheaper somewhere else?  Maybe, but overall, it's a good value.\u000a\u000aCons\u000a- Umm....I can't think of one.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet your drunk a$$ I will!

VI don't normally eat at Jack in the Crack, but I was on my way to Aria to have drinks with my wife and some friends & and realized that I didn't have anything to eat in the past 8 hrs.  That's not smart, especially if you're going to do some drinking....so, I stopped by this place to grab a quick bite to prepare my stomach for some alcohol.\u000a\u000aI ordered 2 Big Cheeseburgers and a bottle of water in the Drive Thru.  It was fast and the burgers were hot.  They tasted ok.....they served their purpose well.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  If I'm in a pinch, sure.

VI'm a fan of Subway in general....but this place is a good one because it makes good sandwiches.  Unlike the other reviewer, I've never had any issues with this location's cleanliness.  I've eaten here at least 15 times over the past 3 years.  It's on my way home from the gym, so I stop in here for a meal often.\u000a\u000aThis last visit, I ordered a 12" BMT on Italian Cheese Bread, Jalapeno Chips, and brought my own Bottle of Water (much cheaper this way).\u000a\u000aThe BMT was awesome.  I had it toasted and put Provolone, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Green Peppers, Pepperoncini, Mustard, Mayo, Salt & Pepper, Oregano, Oil & Vinegar on the Sandwich.  Very tasty.....just how I like it.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Unless I move, I will be back soon!

VI remember when this place was pretty cool.  When it opened in 1994 it changed the game for local casinos.  It was once known as the "Royal Flush Capital of the World".  The Buffet attracted tons of people from all over the Vegas Valley and it was hopping every night.  That was when the Maloof's owned the joint.  \u000a\u000aFast forward 17 yrs later......now this place is a shell of it's former self.  I walked into this place a couple of weeks ago and it hasn't aged well.  The vibe it once had.....gone.  The excitement at the slots and table games....gone.  The happy employees.....gone.\u000a\u000aMy desire to return to this place.....gone.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 5%

VHeard from @Dan P that they just tapped a batch of War Dog last Thursday....so I made sure I stopped by for lunch as soon as I came back to Vegas on Sunday.  Brought Mom's with me for our traditional Sunday lunch....we were staving and couldn't wait to get seated.  The Draft House is a Green Bay Packers Bar.....so it was packed with Packer Fans on the bar side....not one available seat or table.  It was 3 pm and the Packers vs Vikings game wasn't for another 2 hrs, but it was packed to the hilt!  We got seated in the dining room area, our server wes named Apple, seriously.\u000a\u000aAfter browsing the menu for a few minutes, we asked Apple if there were any specials....she proceeded to tell us about a bunch of Appetizer Specials ($2 off) and $2 off for the War Dog during the NFL Games, so we took her up on it.  We ordered:\u000a\u000a- 1/2 Order of Nachos $7.50\u000a- Bratwurst $3.50\u000a- Jalapeno Stuffed Pretzels $5\u000a- NFL Hot Wings (10 Wings) w/Chipotle Sauce....their hottest Wing Sauce $6\u000a\u000aTo wash it down, we both ordered Water and I of course ordered a 24 oz War Dog!  ($7.50, $5.50 with the special) The War Dog was freakin' awesome.....not as Hoppy as I expected based on @Dan P's report, but it was very good.\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait, we got our food....Nachos first.  Mom and I attacked those Nachos.  They were pretty good....topped with Sour Cream, Cheese, Guacamole, Olives, Jalapenos, Salsa, and Onions.\u000a\u000aNext up was the NFL Wings.....I jumped on those next....damn, they were awesome!  Very Meaty Wings.....the Chipotle Sauce was just right....had that Smoky flavor and was just Spicy enough for me and Mom.  The Ranch given to us for dipping went well with the Wings.\u000a\u000aThey brought out my Bratwurst next.....I added some Mustard and Relish and went to town on it.  It came with grilled Onions topped on the Bratwurst.  It was pretty good....although the Bun wasn't all that.  I would have preferred a Roll or Italian Bread instead of a Hot Dog Bun.\u000a\u000aThe last item to come out was the Jalapeno Stuffed Pretzels.....they were piping hot and moist and doughy.....delish!  They came with a side of Nacho Cheese for dipping.\u000a\u000aIt was at this point that Mom and I figured out that we ordered too much food.  I wasn't going to let this place defeat me though, so I pressed on.  Mom said she'd finish the Nachos and I would handle whatever was left of the Wings & Pretzels.\u000a\u000aWe took our time watching the Seahawks vs Cardinals game and finished our food and Beer.\u000a\u000aWhen Apple delivered our check she said she made a mistake and gave us the food specials for Monday Night Football, not Sunday....but that the restaurant was going to honor the specials anyway because of the mistake....is that great service or what?\u000a\u000aOverall, great food & great service.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet!

VI haven't been to Fatburger in a while and this was my 1st time to visit this location.  I'm a fan of Fatburger, but not this location.  Here's why.\u000a\u000aFOOD - 4 Stars\u000aI was prepared to give this place a 4 Star rating.  I noticed a new menu since my last visit to a Fatburger and ordered a XXL with all of the toppings & added Bacon & Cheese.  For a side, I ordered the Skinny Fries.\u000a\u000aAfter a 15 minute wait, I received my food.  To my surprise, the Burger was HUGE!  I should have paid more attention to the menu because this monster was more than I expected.....I guess I should have ordered a XL.\u000a\u000aI attacked the Burger and the Fatburger taste that I grew up with was still there.  The sharp flavor from the Mustard Relish and the Onions generated an explosion on my taste buds.  The Bacon was a nice addition and the Cheese was gooey and made it just right.  The Skinny Fries were just ok.\u000a\u000aOverall, the meal was awesome.....now, this is where it went from 4 Stars to 1 Star.....I went to the restroom to wash up since the Burger was pretty messy.  When I got to the restroom I was appalled at how disgusting it was.  It was worse than a Gas Station Bathroom.  The kicker was when I saw that the paper towels to wipe your hands were on top of the toilet.....what's the point of washing your hands when you're about to wipe it on towels that are contaminated from the toilet?!!!  \u000a\u000aSee the pics I uploaded for details....you'll notice the brown paper towels sitting on top of the toilet tank and that the spot on the wall where the dispenser is suppose to be mounted has spots where plaster was used to cover up the holes...the hand towels are almost touching the toilet seat!!!  ....someone must have pulled it off the wall....but they're not going to replace it?  My issue with this is that is the same bathroom where the employees wash their hands.....gross.  To be fair, I've sent an email to their corporate office to make them aware of this situation....it can't be up to code...can it?  I hope not.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Not until they fix the issue with the hand towels.

VWe enjoy visiting the Santa Fe from time to time.  It's near our neighborhood so it's convenient for us when we want a night out.  Here's a highlight of some of our favorite places:\u000a\u000a- The Charcoal Room.  It's their high end dining option.  It's not really "high end", but it's their most expensive restaurant.  The food is very good and is not nearly as expensive as Strip high-end dining.\u000a\u000a- Cabo Mexican Restaurant.  Decent Mexican food.  Their Nachos are really good....the rest of the dishes are ok.\u000a\u000a- 4949 Lounge.  Love this lounge....it's in the middle of the casino.  Friendly bartenders and waitresses.  Great place to hangout with friends or have a business meeting.\u000a\u000aThe property is always clean and there's plenty of parking.....two big deals for me.  Overall, it's a fun locals casino....definitely worth checking out.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VI get my haircut here by Ramona.  My old stylist who worked here left 9 months ago and I was assigned Ramona.  She's a great stylist and cuts my hair the way I like it.  \u000a\u000aIt's very convenient for me as I workout at the 24 Hour Fitness next door and shop at the Von's in the same shopping center.\u000a\u000aI've been very pleased with the customer service here.  I don't have any opinions on the other services they provide because I don't use them.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Absolutely!

VLocated in the heart of the original part of Summerlin, this Starbucks is one of my favorite locations.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a- They have a large outdoor seating area.  With plenty of outdoor seats, this location is great to hang out during the Spring & Fall seasons when the weather is awesome in Vegas.\u000a\u000a- FREE WiFi.  I know it's FREE at all Starbucks, but it's worth mentioning it anyway.\u000a\u000a- Good service.  The employees here are always friendly and get my order right every time.\u000a\u000aOverall, I always have a good experience here.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet.

VI visit this Von's often because it's conveniently located next to my gym.  However, it's not my favorite place to shop.  I only come here in a pinch.  Here's why:\u000a\u000aPROS\u000aClean - This store is always very clean.\u000a\u000aFriendliness - The employees here are pleasant and always friendly and willing to help out.\u000a\u000aCONS\u000aSize & Variety - The rest of the store is a normal Von's, but it's much smaller than the Von's I normally shop at, which means the selection of items is reduced.  I like shopping at smaller stores like Trader Joe's or Whole Foods when it's specialty stuff I'm looking for....but when I'm looking for variety I like larger stores.  Bread selection and veggie selection is limited.\u000a\u000aWeird Design - The store has the Deli & food outlets in the center of the store....what?!  Yeah, it's fakakta.....most Von's are designed the same way so I know my way around, this one isn't....it's a jumbled mess.\u000a\u000aOverall, not one of my favorite places.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Only because it's convenient.  Like they say, it's all about location I guess.

VThis Golf Course is the most convenient one for me to get to a practice range, so I'm here frequently.  It's a small course tucked away in Sun City Summerlin.  Here's the breakdown of the track:\u000a\u000aPROS\u000a- Relatively cheap.  You can get on the course for $20-$25 during the Summer.\u000a\u000a- Nice practice facility.  It's small, but rarely gets crowded.  There's an option to hit off of mats or grass, which is nice.  There's a small practice green too.\u000a\u000a- It's a nice course for a mid to high level handicap player (15+)....because it's a short course (see CONS).\u000a\u000a- Decent condition.  This golf course is kept in nice shape throughout the year.\u000a\u000aCONS\u000a- It's a short course.  6,512 yds from the tips, 6,017 from the white, 5,579 from the gold....ladies tees are 5,099.\u000a\u000a- Limited food selection.  There's not much in terms of food....a small snack bar.\u000a\u000a- Limited pro-shop.  They have the basics, but nothing worth purchasing.  They don't have too many high end products here.\u000a\u000a- Sometimes there is no beer cart on the course.  This happens when the course is slow....they won't bother to send out a beer cart.  I don't drink while playing, but I like to have a few Gatorades & Water.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's not too bad.  Great course for beginners or if you want to sharpen up your short and mid-range irons.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Probably.

Because I workout at the gym next to it and I usually remember the day before the special occasion while I'm working out.....so, after a workout I'll go get the card....then I'm Mr. Hero for not forgetting....ha!\u000a\u000aThere's nothing special about this particular store, except it's location.\u000a\u000aWill I return?

VThe gym is huge and has plenty of equipment.  They keep the equipment in relatively good shape.  I say relatively because from time to time they will let an elliptical or two go and not take care of it right away.\u000a\u000aThere are racquetball courts, a basketball court, spin room, pilates/yoga room, pool, kids day-care, aerobics room, aerobics/cardio machine area, and free weights area.  There is also a juice bar and a small retail section.  From time to time the neighboring gas station will have someone in the gym selling car washes, which is convenient to get during your workout.\u000a\u000aI enjoy working out here....but only gave it 3 stars.  Here's the bad side of this gym:\u000a\u000a- There are way too many unsupervised teenagers in the gym during the weekday nights.....they clog up machines and weights and leave the gym a mess.\u000a\u000a- The staff doesn't keep the place clean on occasion.  Many times they are out of towels and the men's locker room can look disgusting.\u000a\u000a- You always have to ask the staff to change the channels on the TVs for major sporting events.....they should know that the World Series or NFL Playoffs are on.....and set those channels up.  Instead, you have to walk back downstairs and ask them to do it.....eventually, they will come up and do it.\u000a\u000aIf it wasn't for the size and selection of machines at this gym, I would have rated it 2 stars.\u000a\u000aWill I come back?  Of course, I have a membership here.....however, if there was a better option as conveniently located as this one is to my house, then I would change gyms.

VI don't know why I continue to come to this gym.....it has continued it's downhill spiral.  Since my last review, which was ONLY 7 months ago......\u000a\u000a- One of the water fountains in the main workout room broke down, was removed, and hasn't been replaced......it's been gone for weeks now.\u000a\u000a- The sinks are still filthy and moldy.\u000a\u000a- The Men's locker room is a disaster every day......dirty towels everywhere.  The dirty towel container is always full and overflowing.\u000a\u000a- The showers in the Men's locker room are always so disgusting that I've stopped taking showers there.....I go back home to clean up.\u000a\u000aSo why am I still a member there?  I have a really great monthly rate ($36) and I hate crowded gyms.....the other two gyms near my home, one a 24 Hr Fitness & the other a Las Vegas Athletic Club, are always crowded and my monthly membership costs would go up.......so those are the only 2 reasons why I'm still a member here.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I'm here 4 to 6 times per week.....highly probable.

VEven though I changed my membership so I can go to any other 24 Hr Fitness in the Valley, I still come here.....bad habits are hard to break I guess.  This morning was especially frustrating, here's why:\u000a\u000a- The gym is freakin' cold....I get that you need ventilation to cool off, but why does it have to be FREEZING in there?!  Doesn't make any sense at all....my muscles get stiff after a solid workout and it's just too damn uncomfortable.  Complaining to the staff doesn't do any good because they tell you it's controlled by the Corporate Office in California....yeah right.\u000a\u000a- The personal trainers today were really annoying.  One of them had one of their clients doing situps in the middle of the freakin' aisle where the front row of elliptical machines were.....seriously, there's a private room for the personal trainers that's empty 99% of the time....why they insist on being jerks to the rest of the members like this is beyond me.  Another one of them hung their sweatshirt on the bar of one of the bench presses while they had their client do a workout nearby......which tied up the bench press because people didn't know if someone was working out on the press and would be right back or what the deal was.....these personal trainers here have no sense of gym ettiquette.\u000a\u000aI'm not one to make New Year's resolutions, but I think my resolution will be to finally get away from this place and go to the Centennial 24 Hr Fitness location.  The problem is, it will probably have some of these problems too.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I hope not, but old habits are tough to break.

VI have to give them credit....over the past months there has been a noticeable improvement of many of the issues in my prior reviews:\u000a\u000a- Ellipticals received a lot of attention and maintenance.....they're in great shape now.\u000a\u000a- The gym is getting cleaner.  They've made a good attempt to clean it up.  Although, the members here are still pigs....at least the men's locker room is always a mess, but at least the gym is getting it clean, it's the members who trash it.  I can't believe how inconsiderate some people are!\u000a\u000a- The employees at the front desk are very friendly.\u000a\u000a- Most of the personal trainers have improved their etiquette and don't get in the way.....however, there are 2 that always tie up several pieces of equipment and have their clients workout on the floor next to the free weight benches and effectively prevent people from using that equipment.....why don't they use the private personal trainer room that's always empty?!\u000a\u000a- The water fountain in the weight room was repaired....finally.\u000a\u000aI hope they keep up the improvement and good work.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%.....I'm there 5-6 days a week and I can't break my habit of going to this one.

VTaco Bell.....my favorite place to grab a quick bite when I'm short on cash in the wallet.  My Son enjoys a bunch of menu items here, but I'm a simple guy.  90% of the time I get 2 Bean Burritos, sometimes I order a 7 Layer Burrito.  \u000a\u000aThis location always has fresh ingredients and always has quick, accurate service.  It's nestled between Sun City Summerlin (which is a retirement community) and the original Summerlin, which is a little over 20 yrs old.....so there's rarely a long line or wait here.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I'm sure I will.

VI've been going to Town Center Dental for 6 years now.  Dr. Devore is one of the best dentists I've had in Vegas.  When I first moved here in '93 I bounced around dentists because I couldn't find one.  I found one for a few years, but then he retired.\u000a\u000a6 yrs ago a colleague at work recommended Dr. Devore.  I tried him out and my family has been seeing him ever since.  He is a really nice guy who really cares about his patients.  I've recommended him to several people and they all love him.  A+++ in my book.

VLocated around the corner from Highland Falls Golf Course, I like to stop by this location to grab a quick bite before a round of golf.  I really like the Sausage Biscuit Sandwich here.  They always get my order right and are fast.  I don't ask for much from my fast food restaurants....ha!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  As long as I'm golfing, there's a good chance.

VI'm a huge fan of this place and here's why:\u000a\u000aPro's\u000a- Convenient....I work out at the 24 Hour Fitness next door.\u000a- They often offer to wash your car while you work out & have people working at the gym to take your car to get it washed.\u000a- The convenience store is clean and carries good products.\u000a- They have full service attendants to gas up your car at no additional cost....only tips if you choose.\u000a- Their oil change/smog check garage is quick and does a good job.\u000a\u000aCons\u000aI seriously can't think of any.\u000a\u000aWill I return? ...of course.

VI have a love/hate relationship with Burlington Coat Factory.  I love that I can find great clothes and items from time to time.....but I hate that it's so difficult to find those hidden gems.\u000a\u000aMy most recent visit this week was for a specific purpose....to purchase a warm overcoat for a trip to Beijing in November.  It was a Thursday morning and there wasn't very many people in the store....thank God! It can get pretty busy and messy.\u000a\u000aAfter searching the store for 15 minutes or so, I finally found the overcoats section I was looking for.  Of course the sizes were not where they should be, so I had to look through every hanger just to make sure.  I found three coats that I liked.  Now, I had to find The Better Half (TBH) so she could help me choose.\u000a\u000aWhile I was looking for TBH, I passed by the shoes section and found two pairs of shoes I wanted....dammit! Over budget already!\u000a\u000aI eventually found TBH and she helped me pick the coat, which I was able to pick up at a reasonable price.  I headed to the registers, which is always a disaster.  It took me 15 minutes to check out....that was with 1 person in front of me!  Oh well.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was an above average visit to this place.  I've come here many times over the years and it has improved.  They are renovating a part of the store and I hope they make it more intuitive to find stuff.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I'm sure I will.

VI love this Burlington Coat Factory location.  I didn't realize how much I did until I moved away to Phoenix and saw the tiny Burlington's there.  This Burlington location is easily 2x larger than the stores in Phoenix.  There's 3x the selection for suits, ties, and shirts....which is what I was shopping for.  There's also an extensive watch section which has some decent watches for sale.  The shoe selection here is massive as well.  What a great store all the way around!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VAnother one of my favorite charities, I was first introduced to them a few years ago at their annual 5k event.  I've always heard about the House, but didn't know what they did for the community until I took the tour of the facility.  When kids are seriously ill and need to travel to Las Vegas for healthcare, the House provides a place for them and their families to be together during the crisis.  There's so many things we take for granted when we have money and health insurance, that we don't realize just how lucky we are.  For complete details of what they do at the House, here's the link to their site:\u000ahttp://www.rmhlv.com/story.html\u000a\u000aI am impressed with the amount of effort and energy that the volunteers put into helping these needy families.  I met a few of the kids impacted by their efforts and to see the hope and happiness on their face was priceless.\u000a\u000aI try not to miss a 5k event.  It's for a great cause and I've met some wonderful people.  Return Factor - 100%

VMy Mom loves this place and comes here at least once a month.  I, on the other hand, think it's just A-OK.  There's a nice selection of food, but it seems lacking to me.  Here's my +/- breakdown:\u000a\u000a+ Large selection of food.  There's plenty of options.  They even have Pizza, although I don't recommend it....it's an Asian Buffet for Pete's sake!\u000a\u000a+ Decent service.  This place is always busy and they usually keep up with the pace.  Food is generally kept stocked on the food lines and the servers keep the glasses full.\u000a\u000a+ Food quality is OK for a buffet.  It's not great, but hell it's AYCE.....this isn't the Bellagio Buffet.\u000a\u000a+ Price.  The price use to be really good, but they've been steadily increasing prices over the past couple of years.....but still, $6.99 for a lunch buffet?!  That's pretty cheap in my book.\u000a\u000a- Parking.  Parking is a bitch when it's busy.....it's not the restaurant's fault though and my Star Rating doesn't reflect this....just saying, FYI.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's pretty good value.  If you don't like waiting, I suggest going in between meal periods when it's slower than peak times.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 75%

VAwesome place.  I ate there for lunch last year when our General Manager hosted a luncheon for management during Christmas week.  We were served family style with so many great dishes.  I stuffed myself beyond belief.  Some of my favorites.....\u000a\u000aEggplant Parmesan, Gnocchi, Lasagna......all very good.  The bread was excellent as well.  Since I didn't pay for it, I have no idea what the cost was, but it didn't seem like it was expensive.

VI've only eaten here once, which was 3 weeks ago.  I went there because i heard that they had great burgers.  I've been searching for a good burger place ever since Kilroy's stopped serving food.....(because of the smoking ban in restaurants).....but that's another story.\u000a\u000aI had one of their specialty burgers, a BBQ Hickory burger, which was delicious.  The fries were OK, nothing special there.  I don't have much more to say other than I will come back and try one of the other burgers.  The burger was good but not Awesome, that's why I only gave it 3 stars.  I'll try it again and see if one of the others changes my mind.

VFor the past two Sundays, I've come here to hang out for a couple of hours while my Son is at a Church function.  I enjoy watching the Sunday night football game here and enjoying a drink or two.  Last night I decided to grab a bite to eat.\u000a\u000aI was dining by myself and wanted some finger food.  After browsing the menu for a few minutes, I decided to go with the Nachos ($10.50).  To wash it down, I had an Iced Tea.\u000a\u000aI watched the Giants/Bears game while I waited for my grub......it didn't take too long before it came....the waitress delivered the Nachos and they were a friggin' mountain of Nachos!  (see pics) Seriously.....I'm not opposed to large portions, but damn this thing could easily feed 4 people!  I was a little pissed because I didn't want to eat that much and the waitress didn't say anything.....also the menu didn't mention the gargantuan size of the Nachos either.  I reacted by saying "Damn, that's a friggin' mountain of food!".....she replied "I know"......well if you knew, why didn't you say something when I ordered it?!\u000a\u000aThis is where I am torn....do I knock off a Star because of this?  or not?  I personally feel that it's the server's responsibility to inform customers of stuff like this....especially when they see someone is dining alone and portion size is not mentioned on the menu.\u000a\u000aBack to the food....the Nachos were topped with melted Cheddar Cheese, Jalapenos, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Onions, Olives, Tomatoes.  The thing was so massive that stuff was falling off the edges of plate....another faux pas from the server is that she didn't offer me a smaller plate to eat my Nachos.....she expected me to pull pieces off this mountain and have it fall all over the table like a pig.  I tried for a few minutes but felt like a slob so I asked her for a plate, which she brought over right away.\u000a\u000aThe Nachos flavor wasn't spectacular, it was bleh.  The Cheese wasn't gooey....it was melted, but seemed to be sitting a little while because it was already coagulating and it was difficult to eat the Nachos without using a fork.  Also, it was top heavy with the toppings....meaning after the 1st layer of Nachos, there was nothing but bare chips in the lower sections.  What's the point of this dish then?  I don't know.....I felt bad because I didn't even come close to finishing it and it wasn't worth taking home......what a waste of food.\u000a\u000aI took off 1 Star because of the bad service.....still a great place to catch a game.  I've eaten here many times in the past with great experiences, but was an inactive Yelper at the time so those experiences are outdated.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Because of my favorable history with Big Dog's, I will give them another chance.....next time I'm asking the server how large the portion is.

VA nice laid back type of radio station.  They play mainstream music, no rap or metal....kind of middle of the road stuff.  "Safe music" as I like to call it.  I don't listen to it very often, but when I do it's not bad and not great...kind of middle of the road.

VOn of my favorite golf courses to play.  It is reasonably priced throughout the year and is always kept in great condition.  They had a problem with the greens a few years ago, but it has been perfect the past 2 years.\u000a\u000aSome of my favorite holes:\u000a\u000a- #3 Par 3 is a long 227 from the tips, 189 Blue, 167 White....what makes this hole fun and challenging is the huge water hazard on the right side.  It plays mind games with you, especially if you're a right handed hitter and slice the ball.\u000a\u000a- #8 Par 4 tempts all golfers as it is a driveable 326 (Tips), 308 (Blue), 296 (White)....with a little luck, you can get on the green or close enough for a short chip.  The killer is the water hazard on the front right side of the green that makes it very tight on the left.  Could be disastrous for right handed slicers.\u000a\u000a- #16 Par 3 is a manageable 212 (Tips), 180 (Blue), 155 (White)....small water hazard and a lot of fun.  My friends and I have had several close calls on holes in one on this hole.\u000a\u000aOther positives about the course is the driving range and the restaurant.  The driving range is large enough to accommodate a lot of golfers and you don't feel cramped.  Also, there is a very good practice green which is kept in great shape as well.\u000a\u000aThe food in the clubhouse is decent bar food.  I've had the Chicken Sandwich, Burger, and Fries here....all good after a day in the sun.  Of course plenty of beer!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet I will!

VFor my 800th review I chose my alma mater, UNLV.  It's been a while since I've graduated from this University.  However, I've had many interns from the school work for me and have hired many graduates over the years.  I also attend a lot of events at the school and remain very close with Alumni.  Here's my breakdown of the school:\u000a\u000aPROS\u000a\u000a- It's very cheap.  Even though tuition is going up, it's still less than many other State schools.\u000a\u000a- Much of the campus has new buildings.  When I go on campus now, it feels like a strange place and I get lost all of the time because its 3x larger than it was when I attended.\u000a\u000a- Great professors.  I can only speak about the College of Hotel Administration and the Business School.....the professors were awesome.  I learned so much from them.  Learning is a 2 way street, it's up to you to get as much out of it as you can.  It's not on the professors to make the class how you like it, you have to adjust to their teaching style and learn as much as possible.  To this day I remain in contact with many former professors.\u000a\u000a- Nice campus.  By Vegas standards there's a lot of greenery around campus, which is a refreshing change of scenery.\u000a\u000a- Library.  One of the best libraries in town is located on the UNLV campus.\u000a\u000a- Basketball team.  The UNLV Runnin' Rebels have always been the favorite team in the city.  We've had some good years recently.  Hopefully we'll continue to build upon it and improve as time goes on.\u000a\u000aCONS\u000a\u000a- Minuscule Endowment Fund.  One of the main reasons UNLV is having a difficult time surviving in this economy is not only because of state cutbacks but also because the endowment is very tiny.  The school needs more support from the private sector.\u000a\u000a- Visitor parking.  Student parking has improved dramatically since the time I was a student.....however, visitor parking is a nightmare.  I dread parking every time I go on campus.\u000a\u000aOverall, I have fond memories of UNLV.  My experience here has helped me with my career and I've established many lifelong friendships over the years.  I would be proud to send my Son to this school.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VWas invited to an event here.  I'm impressed by the top notch service delivered by every employee.  From the valet team to the front desk, they were on top of our every need.\u000a\u000aThis review is not of the rooms since we didn't stay here.  However, the wait staff and other front of the house employee made our short visit memorable.  If I had to stay in downtown Phoenix, I'd consider staying here.....great service goes a long way with me.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VThere are many people in need of food.  Sometimes we take for granted how blessed we are to have what we need.  St Mary's helps those who aren't so fortunate.  Whenever there's a food drive, our family ensures that we donate several bags of food.  We make sure it's non-perishable and that the packaging is durable so that it can be easily stored, transported, and distributed.\u000a\u000aAs long as they continue to help feed the needy, we'll keep coming back to assist.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VThis review is for the football stadium located on campus.  They host high school football games on Friday nights.  The bleachers are about the same as a high school football field built in the 1990's.  The restrooms and concession stands are on par with a high school football field too.  However, this is a college, LOL.  You'd expect something a little more modern and better quality.\u000a\u000aThe only thing I liked about this place is the parking.  It was very easy to find parking and with a lot of cars, was easy to get in/out.  Other than that, it was sub-par.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 20%

VSome colleagues and I made the drive all the way to the other side of town for lunch one day to try their Dim Sum.  They were in an AZ Central article listing them as one of the best Dim Sum restaurants in the Valley.\u000a\u000aWe tried a variety of items and I'm not sure exactly what it was...we just ordered what looked good.  I tried a Pork Dumpling, a BBQ Pork stuffed puffy thing, Spicy Beef and Veggies, and a puffy thing stuffed with I think Beans.\u000a\u000aThe food was OK, not as great as the AZ Central article.  I was expecting food as good as Ping Pang Pong in Vegas when I read the accolades.  I think I over-hyped it in my mind before our visit.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant is located in a sketchy neighborhood.  I wouldn't come back at night, that's for sure.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 20%

VI was hungry and in the area during lunchtime.  After a quick search on the Yelp app, I found this place.  It's a dive Mexican joint offering street Tacos and Burritos.  The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the Prize Claw machine....these things are everywhere now, what's the deal with that?  Anyway, back to the food....since I'm rarely in this area I decided to try a couple of items:\u000a\u000aBean & Cheese Burrito, $3.75\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix-2?select=RRp-4xY9uBuTEliMx6JUVA#RRp-4xY9uBuTEliMx6JUVA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix-2?select=AowjfEJkRsLVmQqrZW4R9A#AowjfEJkRsLVmQqrZW4R9A\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix-2?select=Vv_y6-9lSKlBwAwULmgK0Q#Vv_y6-9lSKlBwAwULmgK0Q\u000a\u000aCarne Asada Taco, $1.35\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix-2?select=Al2QHYAViDvTXh_hkFizQg#Al2QHYAViDvTXh_hkFizQg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix-2?select=lBu9D7gzrZfL8zLIwC-Ynw#lBu9D7gzrZfL8zLIwC-Ynw\u000a\u000aThe Bean & Cheese Burrito was very good.  The Tortilla & Beans tasted fresh and was not greasy.  The Tacos were simple street Tacos....Carne Asada Steak, Cilantro, Onions, Corn Tortillas....these were very good as well.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a pretty good Mexican food joint....wish it was closer to my neighborhood.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 87%

VIt's been a while since we've dined at a Claim Jumper restaurant.  We picked this place because it was half way between us and where a friend was visiting and it's just off the 101.  We were disappointed to learn that some of our favorite dishes are no longer on the menu.  We loved the Crispy Asian Chicken Salad....gone.  What about the Salad Bar?  Gone.  Dammit.  Instead we settled on the following items:\u000a\u000aSliders, $10.99\u000aPotato Skins, $9.99\u000aBaby Back Ribs, $23.99\u000a\u000aThe Potato Skins were very good and so were the Sliders.  However, the Baby Back Ribs were terrible.  They were too dry and didn't "slide" off the bone like you'd expect them to.  Next time, we'll pass on those.\u000a\u000aOur server was very friendly and entertaining.  She also never rushed us.  Since we were meeting friends on this visit, we had a long dinner and stayed for drinks and Dessert much later than most diners.  She was super cool about it and stopped by to check in on us from time to time.\u000a\u000aToo bad about our deleted favorite menu items.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

It's a really big place full of hidden treasures.\u000a\u000aI enjoy browsing the glass showcases, which encompass nearly 1/2 of the place.  There are tons of sports collectibles and every once in a while a Star Wars or Star Trek collectible worth buying....either way, it's fun to browse the goods.\u000a\u000aThe most recent visit, we spent a few hours in this place.

VLocated in our neighborhood, this place was hidden in plain sight....I've passed it at least 100x and for some reason, never noticed it.  Then, one day a colleague who lived in the neighborhood told me about a good Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood and I was like "what? where?".

VDropped by this location for lunch one day.  At first glance at the sign, I thought it was an "ertos" restaurant...so I was hoping to add to my list, but alas I was wrong.  Anyway, back to the food...I ordered:\u000a\u000aBeans Rice Cheese Burrito, $3.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=h7C-FELeuWn6jQmMYTNCpQ#h7C-FELeuWn6jQmMYTNCpQ\u000a\u000aCarne Asada Taco, $2.70\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=G3gvbjKUYUrbUdw-HTAe3g#G3gvbjKUYUrbUdw-HTAe3g\u000a\u000aCarnitas Taco, $2.70\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=JZZ49x4O5tCsDBnZ-o469w#JZZ49x4O5tCsDBnZ-o469w\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=71Hp0jEjm3UHZBKwYEcbpQ#71Hp0jEjm3UHZBKwYEcbpQ\u000a\u000aMed Diet Coke, $1.55\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=pU-8Lht5NSkG0460_w6mEA#pU-8Lht5NSkG0460_w6mEA\u000a\u000aWhile I was waiting for my order, I went to the Salsa Bar to load up.  I saw that they had the typical Green & Red runny, mild Salsa and some Chunky Spicy Salsa...yes!  I like spicy, so I grabbed a few cups and filled them up.  Slight problem though...the cups for the Salsa were the soft, paper like cups typically used for Ketchup & Mustard.  You're probably wondering why that's a problem?  Well, it's because when you fill it up with Salsa, it becomes wet and soft and very difficult to carry in your hand because it spills all over the place....yep, it was very messy.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=g1dj4KmtgcSb0p46KFcaHA#g1dj4KmtgcSb0p46KFcaHA\u000a\u000aThe food came out a short while later and I started with the Carne Asada Taco....it is a pretty big portion for Street Tacos.  The portion size was the only positive though....the meat was bland....and the Guacamole and Pico de Gallo that was on the Taco didn't help much.\u000a\u000aNext was the Carnitas Taco.  This one had slight more flavor and was a little better than the Carne Asada....however, it was average at best.\u000a\u000aLast but not least was the Beans/Rice/Cheese Burrito.  This was very good.  Some Mexican Joints like these have oily BRC Burritos...but not here.  There was no oil and the ingredients tasted fresh.  The Tortilla was very good as well.\u000a\u000aOverall, my experience here was average...3 Stars.  If I do come back, it would be strictly for the BRC Burrito.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VWow, this is a big Antique store.  I don't know what took us so long to drive out to Chandler to check it out, but we were happy that we did.  We spent over 3 hrs in this place looking at all of the booths and items.  It's a well organized store with plenty of room to see all of the booths and great lighting so you can see what you're looking at.\u000a\u000aThere's a section where the small collectibles and jewelry are located.  The Better Half found a Silver bracelet and ring.  I spent most of the time looking at all of the collectible stuff.\u000a\u000aIf you're hungry, there's a Hot Dog restaurant inside the store, so you can have a quick bite.  Next time, I will give it a try.\u000a\u000aFor those of you who have to wait around for a spouse to do some shopping...there's plenty of comfortable chairs and sofas where you can wait.\u000a\u000aThey also have large, flat-bed carts for taking big items out to your car...very convenient.\u000a\u000aOverall, we were very impressed with this store.  We'll be back soon.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 98%

VI've heard so much about this place, I had to make the drive out to Maricopa to check it out.  It was a long drive from Scottsdale....it took me about 1 hour.  When I arrived, I was surprised at how busy it was.....this place is in the middle of nowhere, but somehow they attract a ton of people!\u000a\u000aThe slots and tables were pretty busy.  Everyone was having a good time.  The employees were very friendly and welcoming.  It seemed like everywhere I went people were asking me if I needed help with finding something.....very cool.\u000a\u000aThe only downside is that it's a Harrah's....which means it's not much different than the other Harrah's throughout the country....same decor, same food options, etc.  That's kind of boring to me.  Oh well, I'm glad I got to see this place.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 10%

VWas finally able to catch a few Giants games this past Spring Training season.  I had high hopes for this stadium, but it disappointed me.  The main reason is that parking is not only awful, it's confusing, dangerous and expensive....why?  Because there is no parking near the stadium.  You have to drive all over Old Town Scottsdale to try and find parking.  All of the parking close to the Stadium is reserved for special ticket holders and parking passes.  A cop told me to drive around and find a spot that there was plenty of "free" parking.  The problem with that is that many of the parking spots in Old Town have a 3 hr limit on them.....if you get to the stadium 1 hr early to eat, get pics, shop, and get autographs/meet players, that only leaves 2 hrs for the game....has anyone watched baseball in the last 100 yrs?!  There's no such thing as a 2 hour baseball game!  So, you'll get a ticket?  So what are the alternatives?  \u000a\u000aWell, you can park in one of a couple of parking garages nearby, but they're not really nearby, they're kind of far from the stadium and already packed with cars from people who work in the area, so to find a spot is damn near impossible....plus to get to the stadium, you can either walk the long distance or tip one of dozens of golf carts that are working the parking lots to transport people to/from the stadium, a $5 tip each way and you're out $10....why don't they just build a Freakin' parking garage next to the stadium and charge $10 to park there?!  It's more convenient and less of a hassle.  \u000a\u000aAnother alternative is to park in a nearby business parking lot that sells spots for $5 to $10....again, another argument to build a parking garage next to the stadium and charge.\u000a\u000aSorry for the long rant on parking, but it's really that bad.\u000a\u000aOnce I got inside, it was a pretty cool experience, just like most Spring Training ballparks.  To eat, I had:\u000a\u000aCheese Pizza Slice, $6.50\u000aSmall Drink, $4.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scottsdale-stadium-scottsdale?select=p35PrY5ndBEHAfhRfL-ORg#p35PrY5ndBEHAfhRfL-ORg\u000a\u000aOur seats were awesome.  One day it rained cats & dogs.  Another day, it was perfect.\u000a\u000aOverall, great baseball experience.....awful arrival/departure experience.  I'm glad I got to check this stadium off my bucket list.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

VImagine a dozen of large tents full of hundreds of antique, classic, and modern cars.  Now imagine all of those cars getting sold in a nonstop auction for 6 days.  This is a car enthusiast's dream.  Staged at Westworld in North Scottsdale you'll see everything from classic muscle cars to one-off collector cars.  \u000a\u000aThis year was my 2nd year at the Scottsdale auction, which is their grand daddy.  I've been to the Vegas auction, but it doesn't compare to this.  There's so many cars that it will take you 2 to 3 days to see them all.\u000a\u000aBidder's paddles are $500 and you have to pay 10% on top of the final hammer price.  If you find a car or cars you want, it's worth it.  It's also fun to just sit back and watch the action.  The best days to go are Thu/Fri/Sat.  Sat can be nuts, so plan accordingly.\u000a\u000aTip - Driving to/from can be challenging because of the sheer volume of people.  Parking is also a challenge.  So, for convenience sake consider paying $20 for valet ($30 on Sat) and you'll be at the front door.  Or, find a hotel shuttle and take it to the event.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VLocated in the food court of the Fashion Square Mall, I don't come to this Johnny Rockets location too often.  However, when I do, I like to indulge in a Single w/Cheese, $5.49.  Designed like an old school, diner, it brings back fond memories of my first experience with Johnny Rockets in Westwood, CA near UCLA.\u000a\u000aThey make their Burgers fresh here, so it takes a while for your order to come out....but it's worth it!  Because of it's location, this place is always busy when I pass by, otherwise I'd dine here more often.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a great Burger and good vibe.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VAnother find via Groupon, we visited this place a handful of times.  Located in Old Town Scottsdale, just off Scottsdale Rd, we tried a variety of menu items here:\u000a\u000aHummus, $5.99\u000aGyro Classic Plate, $12.99\u000a\u000aVegetarian Combo (Falafel, Hummus, Tabbouleh, Babaghanouj, Grape Leaves, Tomatoes, Pickles, Olive Oil), $9.99\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pita-house-scottsdale?select=g-Fgs-_PKrXi8J6gg3Umng#g-Fgs-_PKrXi8J6gg3Umng\u000a\u000aGyro Classic Pita Sandwich, $7.99\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pita-house-scottsdale?select=TqZir7v84Zns_aApeOhXxw#TqZir7v84Zns_aApeOhXxw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pita-house-scottsdale?select=tkKfkXsMaPJsb1Dn77sZ1g#tkKfkXsMaPJsb1Dn77sZ1g\u000a\u000aThe first time we visited, I got the Gyro Classic Plate, which is basically all of the ingredients in a Gyro Sandwich, but on a plate which makes it a larger portion.  It was a bit too much for me, so on subsequent visits, I ordered the Gyro Classic Sandwich.  The Gyros are ok, not great.\u000a\u000aMy favorite menu item here is the Vegetarian Combo.  It has all of my favorites on it.....Falafel, Hummus, Tabbouleh, yum!  However, I've had better in my life, which is why I'm only giving this joint 3 stars.\u000a\u000aThe service is so/so here.  One evening, we had awesome service....on a couple other visits, it wasn't very good.

VThanks to Groupon, we were able to find this place.  Located in Old Town just West of the Arts District, this Pizza joint is tucked away and kind of hard to find if you're not familiar with the area.  The signage is small and hard to read from the street.  Also, the parking here is atrocious....very few spots on the street and a tiny parking lot adjacent to the restaurant.  There's also a few lots across the street, but they belong to other businesses and you might get ticketed there....we took a chance and parked behind Prestige Cleaners across the street....there were no other spots avail, we had no choice.\u000a\u000aTo enter, you have to walk through a small section of their patio seating.  The indoor dining room is pretty small and tables are tight....I don't recommend for groups larger than 6 people...outside seating is better for that.  Since it was still blazing hot outside, we sat inside.\u000a\u000aAfter browsing the menu, we decided to order:\u000a\u000aAmericana Pizza (Pepperoni, Cheese), $15\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grazie-pizzeria-and-wine-bar-scottsdale?select=-DWyi7nRMAp5fjmTFIgJXw#-DWyi7nRMAp5fjmTFIgJXw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grazie-pizzeria-and-wine-bar-scottsdale?select=UfuwVsHtCTo_QLyHsPVbNQ#UfuwVsHtCTo_QLyHsPVbNQ\u000a\u000aComplimenti Alla Mamma Pizza (Ham, Salame, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Mozzarella), $16\u000a\u000aCaprese, $9\u000a\u000aRed Sangria\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grazie-pizzeria-and-wine-bar-scottsdale?select=LsEh4oNsfJCSplVJTsfriA#LsEh4oNsfJCSplVJTsfriA\u000a\u000aThe Caprese came out first and was very good.  The portion size can easily feed 2 people as an appetizer.\u000a\u000aBoth of the Pizzas we had were very good.  I thought the Alla Mamma Pizza was better than the Americana Pizza...but they were both excellent.  The Americana was a bit soggy for our tastes (too much Sauce)...but it was full of flavor.\u000a\u000aThe Sangria helped us wash it all down....it comes in a nice sized carafe....can easily satisfy 2 or 3 people.\u000a\u000aService here was pretty good too.  Overall, a nice time out.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 77%

VMy Son needed a graphing calculator for his Algebra class, so I stopped by this location to look for one.  It was 3 pm on a Wed and the place wasn't busy at all.  I waited for 5 minutes or so for a person in Electronics to help me out.  He showed me where the calculators were located and he unlocked the display so I could purchase the one I needed....it was $106!  WTF?!  Who knew these damn things were so expensive!  My HP 12C Financial Calculator only cost $80 or so.....but that was back in 1997.....now I feel old.\u000a\u000aThe store was well organized and clean.  More importantly, the parking lot was easy to navigate and get in/out of conveniently....sometimes that's not the case when dealing with Wally World.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VTime for a review update.  This Walmart has a nice selection of guns and ammo.  I recently stopped by to look at their AR-15's so I could get some comparative prices before this weekend's gun show.  The guy working the gun section was very friendly and allowed us to check out each gun in the case we were interested in.  Will definitely come back for the ammo, which is hard to find nowadays.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VAttended a private event here.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a very large venue in Old Town Scottsdale that felt like a nice concert hall.  I can't believe this isn't used more frequently.  It's located in a part of Old Town that doesn't get much foot traffic at night and the parking is scattered around small lots surrounding the building plus side streets, so it's not a convenient place to visit.  However, the interior is perfect for small to mid size (1000) events.\u000a\u000aThere's a stage, lighting, and sound already built in as well as large bars and booths, tables, and chairs.  A large dance floor or main room that allows for a variety of design concepts is in the center of the building.\u000a\u000aThe event I attended used one of the bars and about 3/4 of the room.  It went off without any issues.  I'm seriously considering renting this place for several events I have coming up.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VBased on the recommendations from a few local Yelpers, I decided to stop by this joint to have a few drinks.  The entrance to this bar/lounge is in the rear of the building....that was hilarious because I walked by at least 2 or 3 times hearing music and trying to figure out how the hell to get in, until I saw the sign that read "Like All Good Speakeasys The Entrance Is Hidden In The Rear"....ha!\u000a\u000aUpon entering the bar/lounge, I knew I would love this place....why?\u000a\u000a- It's dark....I love dark bars, hate it when there's too much light....that's the Vampire side of me coming out.\u000a\u000a- The bartender was very cool & knowledgable....when I asked him if he had an IPA on tap, he suggested the Bells Two Hearted Ale IPA and proceeded to tell me about the different flavors I could expect.  Then he stopped by to check and see if he was right and if not, I could get something else.....awesome.\u000a\u000a- They had a band playing, but I arrived after they just finished their set...so I don't know what they were playing.....but I love small live music joints.\u000a\u000a- The lounge area has plush sofas and chairs to hang out with your friends.  I wish I wasn't solo....it would have been nice to sit there with The Better Half and a few friends.\u000a\u000aWhat a great recommendation by fellow Yelpers from Scottsdale/Phoenix....thanks!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet!

VI've dined here twice and have been blown away each time.  The first visit was with a colleague at work.  He suggested that we drop by here for some Happy Hour drinks and some grub.  The 2nd time was with a large group of 20 people.  During both visits I had:\u000a\u000aQueso con Puerco, $9\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roaring-fork-scottsdale?select=bKnbIsW4l8RTkaS9V6WMdQ#bKnbIsW4l8RTkaS9V6WMdQ\u000a\u000aFresh Guacamole, $9\u000a\u000aKettle of Green Chile Pork, $10\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roaring-fork-scottsdale?select=4BV1eQ1pIjNl_31O18pXnw#4BV1eQ1pIjNl_31O18pXnw\u000a\u000aPork Wings (Dr. Pepper BBQ Sauce, Hominy, Pickled Vegetables, & Cotija Cheese), $12\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roaring-fork-scottsdale?select=7oUjMc9Y-to7ukr8hZF66A#7oUjMc9Y-to7ukr8hZF66A\u000a\u000aBig Ass Burger (Poblano Pepper, Cheddar, Smoked Pepper Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, Pickles, & French Fries), $14\u000a\u000aFilet Steak\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roaring-fork-scottsdale?select=SlhE1_wI2NJjRWSzL4CUtA#SlhE1_wI2NJjRWSzL4CUtA\u000a\u000aThe Queso con Puerco is melted Cheese with a green Chile Pork added to it.  It's ridiculously good.....and addicting!  Trust me, you won't stop eating it once you have a bite.\u000a\u000aThe Guacamole is awesome too.  However, I suggest that you give this a try before the Queso con Puerco so that you can taste the full flavor of the Guac.  If you eat the Queso first, the sharp flavors will override the creamy, smooth, subtle flavors of the Guac.  The Guac is outstanding and definitely a must have.\u000a\u000aThe Kettle of Green Chile Pork is pretty good.  It has similar flavors to the Queso, but without the Cheese.  It comes with Tortillas for dipping, wrapping, stuffing, etc.  \u000a\u000aThe Pork Wings were awesome and very interesting.  They look like a Chicken Wing at first glance, but then you realize it's a Pork Rib cooked/cut to look like a Wing, but much larger.  These are full of flavor and a must have.\u000a\u000aThe Big Ass Burger is big and sloppy.  The Poblano Pepper and Smoked Pepper Bacon flavors are prominent and offer a unique taste....which is very good.  Very difficult to take a bite of all layers at once...ha!\u000a\u000aThe Filet has a smokey flavor to it.  It was cooked perfectly and very satisfying.  \u000a\u000aThe service here is outstanding.  Despite being very busy during both visits, we had impeccable service.  Hats off to management and the staff.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VI eat on the run a lot, so I depend on joints like Taco Bell to keep my hunger on standby.  I've been to this one a few times.  They're fast, accurate, and put a little extra ingredients in the Burritos.

VIt's been a while since I've been to this Taco Bell.  I dropped in for lunch yesterday and had great service from the cashier Juan.  He was friendly, patient, and made sure the order was correct.  He also made recommendations to customers on the combo menu if it saved them money or if there was a similar items that they might be interested in.  He should be recognized for his effort as most fast food employees don't give a **** about their job or customers.\u000a\u000aMy food came out fast and accurate.  I ordered a 7 Layer Burrito and 2 Bean Burritos.  The only knock on it was that the Bean Burritos were messy.  When they wrapped them, they got red Sauce all over the outside of it...so the Sauce got on my hands.  Oh well, that happens sometimes during the busy lunch rush.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

They had a nice flavor to them and weren't greasy at all.  However, the Tomato Basil Pizza was not good....2 Stars at best.  The Tomatoes didn't have much flavor and tasted a little "off".....was not happy with that choice.\u000a\u000aTotal damage was around $8 and it included a bottle of Water.  Not bad for 3 Slices.  Next time, I order just Cheese slices.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

VWe stumbled across this joint recently while walking around Old Town Scottsdale.  The Better Half had a craving for Thai Coffee and I used the handy dandy Yelp App to find the nearest Thai restaurant....this was only 1 block away!  I called them and asked if they served Thai Coffee to go.  Once they confirmed that they did, we were on our way.\u000a\u000aThe Thai Coffee was OK, not the best we've ever had, but average.  It looks like a cool place to have a meal, so we'll be back another time to give it a try.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

VOllie the Trolley is a cool way to get around Scottsdale and the surrounding area.  Especially during Spring Training when they add several more trollies and you can get around to the two stadiums in Scottsdale without having to find a parking space.\u000a\u000aBefore we moved here we visited a few friends who took us on the trolley and since then it's been one of those signature Scottsdale images that I have in my mind.

VRead the reviews on Yelp and decided to give this bar a try one night in Scottsdale.  It was one of a few that were open late on a mid-week night and looked appealing.  The restaurant/bar looks like it can be hopping on busy nights, but on this particular night (Wed), it was slow.\u000a\u000aI saddled up to the bar and asked for a menu.  I asked the bartender if they had any IPA's and he suggested the Odell brewing company IPA.  I went for it and asked him what he would recommend I try.  Since  it was considered 'late night', there was a special menu and he suggested the Pork Loin Sliders (3 Sliders with Pepper Jack, Poblano Serrano Mayonnaise, and Tortilla Encrusted Onion Rings).  It sounded awesome, so I went with it.\u000a\u000aThe IPA was really tasty and hit the spot.  After a few minutes, the Pork Loin Sliders came out.  I spread the Poblano Serrano Mayo on them and then for fun added some Fries on the Sliders.  I took a small bite out of the first Slider and it was awesome!  The Pork Loin was moist & juicy and the Poblano Serrano Mayo was the perfect compliment....adding a nice bite to the flavor.  I devoured the Sliders within a few minutes and then sat back and enjoyed the rest of my IPA.\u000a\u000aI really enjoyed this place and would like to return on my next trip to Scottsdale.

VWe were introduced to this place when they offered a Groupon last year.  Friends had talked it up and we couldn't pass it up.  Since then, we have come back several times.    We've dined in the restaurant area and the bar area.  If we want the full service treatment, we'll go in the restaurant....for quick eats, we go into the bar.  You can get the same menu at the bar as the restaurant, but not vice versa.\u000a\u000aWe've ordered the following:\u000a\u000aChopped Liver Platter (Sweet Bell Pepper Strips, Carrot Slaw, Onions, Chopped Egg, 4.95\u000a\u000aSpinach & Artichoke Dip, 9.95\u000a\u000aCheeseburger, $10.95\u000a\u000a12 oz Filet, $37.95\u000a\u000a1/2 & 1/2 Cole Slaw, $2.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/don-and-charlies-scottsdale?select=1Ci3JFh8BI-pWVnAOzTxxw#1Ci3JFh8BI-pWVnAOzTxxw\u000a\u000aOnion Strings, $4.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/don-and-charlies-scottsdale?select=abvoE3gWzuqV72x055JNug#abvoE3gWzuqV72x055JNug\u000a\u000aThe Filet & Cheeseburger are amazing and are my favorite.  I order one of these every visit.  The Better Half loves the Chopped Liver Platter....it's not for me though.  The Onion Strings are addictive...you've been warned.  I love how they offer a Cole Slaw side dish that's 1/2 Creamy and 1/2 Deli style....they're both good, but I give the nod to the Deli style if I had to choose only 1.\u000a\u000aThe service here is pretty good.  The only complaint that I have is that they never have any Ribs when we're here.  Our 1st trip, we came at 8:30 pm and the server told us that they were out of Ribs and that if we ever wanted to have them we'd have to come early like around 5:30 pm because they only order/prepare a limited amount....OK....so we came one day at 5:30 specifically to try the Ribs, guess what?  They were out already....WTF?!  Come on Don & Charlie....order enough to at least give us the opportunity to try this....I'm not going to play the game of come earlier next time.  That's the only bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended) about this joint.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VAfter a nice dinner at Carlsbad Tavern, I was in the mood to shoot pool....since they didn't have a pool table at Carlsbad Cavern, they suggested I drive down the street to Prankster's Too.\u000a\u000aI made the short trip and was pleased to find what I would describe as a Sports Bar style joint.  There were 2 pool tables and a full sized shuffleboard as well as some random video games and plenty of plasma TVs.  I was disappointed though to find nobody playing pool.\u000a\u000aSo, I saddled up to the bar and ordered a Beer and decided to wait and see if a game would start up.  After 20 minutes or so a few guys went over and started playing pool.  I went to the table next to them and was about to rack it up when a couple of guys stopped by and asked if I wanted to play a game of cutthroat.  I actually hate playing that game, but wanted to play and agreed.\u000a\u000aAfter a few minutes I realized that I was getting Hustled.....one guy was acting like the sucker and the other was the ringer.....this wasn't my 1st Rodeo and knew I was getting played....so I decided to play along and pull the rug out from under them.  \u000a\u000aAfter letting me win the 1st 2 games, I could sense that they were about to pounce and start making wagers on the games....I laughed and told them I was going home.  They were pissed and wanted to know why I was taking off....I told them that I don't play games for money with Hustlers and they laughed.  I told them I knew what was going on and pointed out what they were doing.  They both laughed and said "Alright, you got us....", then said....if you were that smart, then I was probably good enough to beat them straight up.  I told them....they will never know.  Then I left....ha!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Hell yeah....next time with my sticks and will find those 2 for a real match.

VFound this place via Living Social and have been here several times since.  It's a classic Spanish Tapas joint.  It gets busy on the weekends when they have live entertainment and Flamenco dancers on the stage.  When that happens, it can get loud and crowded in the lower seating area next to the stage.  We sat there once and didn't like it....it was uncomfortable and The Better Half and I couldn't have a conversation because it was too loud.  It's worth checking out at least once though.\u000a\u000aOver our visits, we've tried the following menu items:\u000a\u000aPan con Tomate, $9\u000a\u000aEmpanada Gallega, $9\u000a\u000aCroquetas, $11\u000a\u000aSpanish Sausage, $9\u000a\u000aPeppers & Goat Cheese, $12\u000a\u000aSpanish Fritatta, $8\u000a\u000aOut of the bunch, my favorites are the Peppers and Goat Cheese, Empanada, and the Spanish Sausage.  The others are just OK.\u000a\u000aThe service here is hit/miss and the Wine selection is not very good.  There are a lot of Spanish Wines on the menu, but they didn't taste good...I've sampled many of them and ended up disappointed every time.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's just an OK joint.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VI'm a huge fan of Grimaldi's Pizza.  The Better Half and I stopped in here for dinner and we had a huge appetite.....which is dangerous in a Pizza joint for me.\u000a\u000aI ordered:\u000aCaprese Salad - $7\u000aPersonal Sized Pizza ($9) with:\u000aSundried Tomatoes - $4\u000aRed Peppers - $4\u000aRicotta Cheese - $2\u000aMushrooms - $2\u000aJalapenos - $2\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mz48xdVWcCu463U3Lm7lhA?select=DZ7xu0LF2IIg2_dI1c_CrA\u000a\u000aThe Better Half ordered a personal sized Pizza ($9) with:\u000aPepperoni - $2\u000aMushrooms - $2\u000aFeta Cheese - $2\u000aBasil - $2\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mz48xdVWcCu463U3Lm7lhA?select=1PaOTe8Ys9uJUP3u4DjHiQ\u000a\u000aYeah, all toppings are al la carte here....so it's not cheap.  The Pizza was awesome!  I enjoyed every bite.  The combination of the sweet taste of Sun Dried Tomatoes combined with the spicy kick of Jalapenos mixed in with Ricotta, Mushrooms, and Red Peppers hit the spot!\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mz48xdVWcCu463U3Lm7lhA?select=l4mZAt7mXpslp4LqexFy5g\u000a\u000aThe Better Half enjoyed her Pizza too.  Since I'm on my no Meat diet, I took her word for it....as much as I was tempted to give it a try, I resisted....maybe next time.\u000a\u000aTo wash it down, she had 2 glasses of Brazin Zinfandel $8 ea, I had 2 O'douls $4 ea.  All in, the dinner was $72 before tip.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a nice dinner.  I finished my food, she took home 1/2 of her Pizza.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VOne of my favorite towns in the Valley.  We have a few friends who live here and frequently visit the resorts and restaurants.\u000a\u000aThings I like:\u000a+ Camelback Mountain\u000a+ All homes must be on an acre or more of land.\u000a+ High standard of living required for all residents.\u000a+ Residents stand by their convictions and don't waver.\u000a+ Awesome resorts and restaurants.  The Sanctuary Resort and El Chorro Lodge are 2 of my favs in PV.\u000a\u000aThings I don't like:\u000a- 40 mph speed limit on major streets cutting through.\u000a- Traffic cameras are everywhere, boo!\u000a- Very few street lights.  It's extremely dark driving around Paradise Valley.  You could miss a street or destination if you're unfamiliar with the area.\u000a- All of the hikers who invade the town to hike Camelback and ignore the local laws and rules.  Then act disrespectful when they are cited.\u000a\u000aOverall, I'd love to live here someday.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VMom bought us gift cards to CPK for Christmas, so we were able to visit this location a few times over the past couple of months.  It's been a while since I've had CPK and they had some new appetizers on the menu.  We decided to give them a try in addition to our fav Pizzas.  Here's what we ordered during our visits:\u000a\u000aWhite Corn Guacamole & Chips (Diced Avocado, Wweet White Corn, Black Beans, Jicama, Bell Pepper, Cilantro and Serrano Peppers), $3.75\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/california-pizza-kitchen-scottsdale?select=uaZq2-wfxVpWYYYxSpYyrw#uaZq2-wfxVpWYYYxSpYyrw\u000a\u000aCrispy Fried Mac n Cheese, $3.75\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/california-pizza-kitchen-scottsdale?select=8vYGRcOLbmb0rlc3KTAXLg#8vYGRcOLbmb0rlc3KTAXLg\u000a\u000aMediterranean Foccacia, $2.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/california-pizza-kitchen-scottsdale?select=yPVdSM2i2ufWRXYnqtMSeg#yPVdSM2i2ufWRXYnqtMSeg\u000a\u000aTuscan Hummus, $6.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/california-pizza-kitchen-scottsdale?select=7wO3BUGMn4G0uTk4FTi3vA#7wO3BUGMn4G0uTk4FTi3vA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/california-pizza-kitchen-scottsdale?select=b6QMjp2Cpd55zXxBG9aX3w#b6QMjp2Cpd55zXxBG9aX3w\u000a\u000aSicilian Pizza (Spicy Marinara, Italian Sausage, spicy Capicola Ham, Salami, Mozzarella, Parmesan, Basil, Oregano), $14.00\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/california-pizza-kitchen-scottsdale?select=vvlzjZxmEtRrp8F9s9ka2Q#vvlzjZxmEtRrp8F9s9ka2Q\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/california-pizza-kitchen-scottsdale?select=twf_t7eT2M27F4AlmdRjFw#twf_t7eT2M27F4AlmdRjFw\u000a\u000aPepperoni Pizza, $12.00\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/california-pizza-kitchen-scottsdale?select=c3-mBgqhLnxdxduZGqofuA#c3-mBgqhLnxdxduZGqofuA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/california-pizza-kitchen-scottsdale?select=czBVNmIlMXG9LpovW938kA#czBVNmIlMXG9LpovW938kA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/california-pizza-kitchen-scottsdale?select=EUOloEMqRQzi6d0Jfnqy3Q#EUOloEMqRQzi6d0Jfnqy3Q\u000a\u000aBelgian Chocolate Souffl Cake\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/california-pizza-kitchen-scottsdale?select=GfuIclDJ-EQKeHHS67gu0A#GfuIclDJ-EQKeHHS67gu0A\u000a\u000aThe White Corn Guacamole tastes awesome, but the Chips suck.  The Chips tasted stale.  However, kudos to the CPK team on creating a yummy variation of Guacamole.  The Fried Mac n Cheese was awesome too.  The Mediterranean Foccacia was too hard for our tastes....we won't order it again.\u000a\u000aThe Sicilian Pizza is my fav...I always get it.  This location does a good job at delivering a tasty old favorite.  Of course, the Pepperoni is a classic and they do it well.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, the Belgian Chocolate Souffle is awesome...very rich.  I split it with The Better Half.\u000a\u000aService here is so/so....they have some young kids who you can tell it's their first serving job.  They're nice though, but need to learn the more refined aspects of customer service.....like making sure your Wine glass is never empty and offering dessert....we had to ask.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VIt has been a while since we've dined at Elements, so we decided to drop in for dinner last week.  It was 6:30 pm on a Thursday and we were able to get seated immediately with no reservation.  After browsing the menu, we decided to order:\u000a\u000aBottle of 2011 Edge Cabernet, $50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=H0EVCkIUGi99mUMFWJhn-g#H0EVCkIUGi99mUMFWJhn-g\u000a\u000aIced Shellfish Platter, $36\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=hNpp4h_HpdQQeEItypxVsw#hNpp4h_HpdQQeEItypxVsw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=7A1cAyB1n_CGFibC94nO5Q#7A1cAyB1n_CGFibC94nO5Q\u000a\u000aWedge Salad, $14\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=ZLZ80iAimkaw6DvsKzP-3g#ZLZ80iAimkaw6DvsKzP-3g\u000a\u000aPepper Encrusted Filet, $44\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=gyhoMxTOhxyW0rpzv4tlAg#gyhoMxTOhxyW0rpzv4tlAg\u000a\u000aHudson Valley Foie Gras, $24\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=VBVpkMDbAofUXa9PBU5Cfw#VBVpkMDbAofUXa9PBU5Cfw\u000a\u000aIrish car bomb, $11\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=BTMQF5GK_IDSaphESOST8Q#BTMQF5GK_IDSaphESOST8Q\u000a\u000aS'mores $11\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=BIkjxuFzsIJUT4_TMQikkw#BIkjxuFzsIJUT4_TMQikkw\u000a\u000aLadgate 20 yr Tawny Port, $14\u000a\u000aFor starters, the Better Half had the Shellfish Platter and was very pleased with it.  It's not as large of a portion as it sounds, but it can be shared between 2 or 3 people.  I had the Wedge Salad, which was too sweet and "soggy" for my tastes.  As you can see in my photo, the Salad had dressing on the bottom of the Salad and was also topped with Pickled Onion, Tomato, and Avocado....it was missing that "crisp crunch" that I love about Wedges.  I won't order it again.\u000a\u000aFor the main course, TBH had the Foie Gras, which she devoured....she loved it.  I had the Pepper Encrusted Filet which was also awesome and cooked perfectly just a shade above Medium.  The Filet was full of flavor and the portion was just right.  To compliment our entree's we had a bottle of 2011 Edge Cabernet, which hit the spot.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, we had the Irish Car Bomb and the S'mores....the Irish Car Bomb was awesome.  The S'mores was good too, but very rich and we couldn't finish it.  They have a nice selection of after dinner drinks, so I had a glass of Ladgate 20 yr Tawny Port to go with dessert.\u000a\u000aThe wait staff is very attentive here and gave us impeccable service throughout dinner.  That's one of the reasons why we love this place.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VThanks to Groupon we gave this location a try.  It's a little farther from our neighborhood than our regular NYPD Pizza location....but for a 50% off deal, we'll make the extra drive.  I'm happy to report that this location is as good as the our favorite on Raintree.\u000a\u000aWe dined in and were seated upstairs near the bar.  It's pretty dark up there and it's more quiet than downstairs, which was jam packed with people dining in, plus all of the people picking up orders.  If you want more privacy, upstairs is the way to go.\u000a\u000aWe ordered the Garlic Cheese Knots as an appetizer and the Brooklyn Family Pizza (Sausage, Pepperoni) and added Salami to it.  We like our Pizza well done and they know how to do that here...it came out perfectly.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-3?select=CbOVy7I3aQgoyWfMOB-MeA#CbOVy7I3aQgoyWfMOB-MeA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-3?select=s57CGAyhkoHxP4HNCkV31w#s57CGAyhkoHxP4HNCkV31w\u000a\u000aThe Garlic Cheese Knots are awesome too...and they're huge!

Located in an older shopping center on Shea & Scottsdale Rd, I recommend that you make advanced reservations and that you request a table away from the windows if it's during the hot months.  The reason is because the tables near the windows are very hot and the AC here is inadequate because it's an older building with inefficient insulation.\u000a\u000aNow, on to the food and drink....during our 2 visits, we ordered:\u000a\u000aParmesan Encrusted Pork Tenderloin, $25.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=_JHsWz6QExzzb0AA1EnFVA#_JHsWz6QExzzb0AA1EnFVA\u000a\u000aPeppered New York Strip, $32.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=oBcMb5p-hvyYty1cnUMV1A#oBcMb5p-hvyYty1cnUMV1A\u000a\u000aMixed Greens Salad, $10.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=dC5ZAKSQQZ9Elhvngs2iLg#dC5ZAKSQQZ9Elhvngs2iLg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=rPW_HwkpUZ5Bu4fRW6KLig#rPW_HwkpUZ5Bu4fRW6KLig\u000a\u000aPietra Santa Merlot, $48\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=hls4h8s8ve_f0F-V8ksaQA#hls4h8s8ve_f0F-V8ksaQA\u000a\u000aHahn Meritage, $60\u000a\u000aCrespelles, $14.95\u000a\u000aGrilled Rack of Lamb Chops, $38.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=W1f-8cJo9etFxHqTCa_9Pw#W1f-8cJo9etFxHqTCa_9Pw\u000a\u000aPan Roasted Duck Breast, $26.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=1HJTB9Obc8QtMtNrZwfz3A#1HJTB9Obc8QtMtNrZwfz3A\u000a\u000aPraline Hazelnut Torte, $8\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=6oN1CA-kP7F01Tl304S9ZQ#6oN1CA-kP7F01Tl304S9ZQ\u000a\u000aTriple Chocolate Torte. $8\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=72impFT4NM8YAheeriXDlA#72impFT4NM8YAheeriXDlA\u000a\u000aWhere do I begin?  Hmmm...well, the Mixed Green Salad is awesome. They have a house dressing that's to die for and goes well with the fresh vegetables.  A perfect way to start a meal.  I ordered on both visits, it's that good.\u000a\u000aThe Peppered NY Strip Steak was nothing to write home about....very average.  However, the Parmesan Encrusted Pork Tenderloin is A-W-E-S-O-M-E!  It has a perfect combination of sweet and meaty flavor to it....well done Razz, well done!  The Pan Roasted Duck Breast and Grilled Rack of Lamb Chops are also fantastic!  We enjoyed 3 out of the 4 entrees we had over the 2 dinners....great job team Razz!\u000a\u000aFor Dessert we had the Praline Hazelnut Torte and the Triple Chocolate Torte.  Both were very good.\u000a\u000aThe Wine we had on both nights was spectacular and went well with our dinner.  They offer a decent selection of Wine.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant also doubles as an art gallery, so you can find paintings on the walls for sale....if that's your gig.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=WoHdKk0R4Mip-GdlUe_Z2g#WoHdKk0R4Mip-GdlUe_Z2g\u000a\u000aWe didn't realize that the kitchen was actually right in front of the bar seats, so the bar seats are premium seats because you can watch Razz and the team cook...Razz will also come up and greet you if you're sitting at the bar.  However, since we didn't book reservations in advance, those seats were taken on both nights we visited.  If we come back, we'll try to book a couple of seats at the bar.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VTucked away in Paradise Valley, this boutique hotel is truly amazing.  I came here to visit friends and have dinner @ Elements.  The view of Paradise Valley is awesome.  It's so quiet here at night that you forget that you're in the Phoenix Metro area.....it truly lives up to it's name.\u000a\u000aThe rooms are awesome and have patios that open up and face the pool area.  We hung out there for hours relaxing and enjoying the atmosphere.   Sometimes just doing nothing in peace & quiet is enough to recharge your batteries.\u000a\u000aI will definitely come back.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VWe discovered this place thanks to Groupon.  I bought 3 Groupons and then I kept seeing this pop up and I kept buying more....so, we've been here quite a bit over the past year.  We love this place because the food is good, servers are friendly, and when the weather is nice the outdoor patio is a perfect place to enjoy a meal.  Here are some highlights of what we've tried:\u000a\u000aCaprese Salad, $8.99\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cove-trattoria-paradise-valley?select=7x7HxjlQu8xUYeQpzU4ghg#7x7HxjlQu8xUYeQpzU4ghg\u000a\u000aBruschetta, $9.99\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cove-trattoria-paradise-valley?select=28td0bOsUi3rhWZMlG9V2A#28td0bOsUi3rhWZMlG9V2A\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cove-trattoria-paradise-valley?select=90SEp0sxi4_0q7shGSJCzQ#90SEp0sxi4_0q7shGSJCzQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cove-trattoria-paradise-valley?select=s6CULpDIzFnW5gbx9cRWJg#s6CULpDIzFnW5gbx9cRWJg\u000a\u000aGrilled Halibut, $21.99\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cove-trattoria-paradise-valley?select=75em7pLz3PEjl9p2i-GNAA#75em7pLz3PEjl9p2i-GNAA\u000a\u000aCalzone, $13.99\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cove-trattoria-paradise-valley?select=iMK_A-UwHCEfGt6R5d04OA#iMK_A-UwHCEfGt6R5d04OA\u000a\u000aMargherita Pizza, $12.99\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cove-trattoria-paradise-valley?select=23-YnOwSWS_1irlHG-GcFQ#23-YnOwSWS_1irlHG-GcFQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cove-trattoria-paradise-valley?select=qnjujUXuNRAToowV9hYuoA#qnjujUXuNRAToowV9hYuoA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cove-trattoria-paradise-valley?select=RR8oSukgiUH5kKpPQtOGOA#RR8oSukgiUH5kKpPQtOGOA\u000a\u000aPiccante Pizza, $13.99\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cove-trattoria-paradise-valley?select=MzA3u7wfdOhA8BZYfAKnHA#MzA3u7wfdOhA8BZYfAKnHA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cove-trattoria-paradise-valley?select=0-O-_Nrm67JrwOYTQazhyg#0-O-_Nrm67JrwOYTQazhyg\u000a\u000aNutella Pizza\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cove-trattoria-paradise-valley?select=Ld4wGjbUrk6niYGON6XJvw#Ld4wGjbUrk6niYGON6XJvw\u000a\u000aPanna Cotta w/Caramel\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cove-trattoria-paradise-valley?select=UmvP1e9r-OuNmyceKXEpBw#UmvP1e9r-OuNmyceKXEpBw\u000a\u000aBy far, our favorite menu items are the Bruschetta and the Pizza.  What makes their Bruschetta unique is the tiny slivers of Proscuitto they mix in with the Capers, Onions, Garlic, Tomatoes, and Basi.  It gives it a slightly salty flavor that goes well with the sweet Tomatoes.  The Pizza dough they use is really soft/fluffy and in my opinion is very addictive.  The portion size of the Pizza is just right for one person with a big appetite, which is me.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a nice place to have dinner.  We'll definitely be back.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

VTucked away in the back of an old, outdoor shopping mall on the SE corner of  Shea & Scottsdale Rd, this gun shop is pretty cool.  We dropped in here to see what they had.  To my surprise, they're very competitively priced.  I saw an AK-style rifle for $559 and a Glock 19 for $499.   Exactly what I was looking for!\u000a\u000aThe place was busy on the day we went, but the guys working there were very friendly and assisted us with our purchase.\u000a\u000aIn addition to a nice selection of guns, they sell a large variety of accessories and ammo.   It's definitely worth dropping by if you're in the area and looking for guns or accessories.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VA good friend of mine recommended this place.

I'm glad we did...\u000a\u000aIt was mid-week and when we arrived, it was very slow.  We were seated in the dining room and there were only 2 other tables there.  We were beginning to wonder if we had the right place.\u000a\u000aAfter browsing the menu, we decided to order:\u000a\u000aCaprese (Fresh Tomato & Mozzarella Appetizer) $10.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A?select=hD15mxhKV-yWyU9iyYSFjg\u000a\u000aCarpaccio di Manzo (Arugula, Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano, Balsamic Vingarette) $11.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A?select=BOaF8AVIQFJzYGdNXfqaVw\u000a\u000aGnocchi Ponte Vecchio (Potato Dumplings, Roasted Red Pepper Cream Sauce) $15.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A?select=A0_HsEQNDFSbZinp4yoqkQ\u000a\u000aRavioli di Zucca (Butternut Squash Ravioli, Walnut Gorgonzola Cream Sauce) $17.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A?select=3OI-0dzP0xwu1KNDKg7uEg\u000a\u000aAnd for dessert....\u000a\u000aTiramisu\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A?select=AaXI7XufOAU0KVaXVoR7_g\u000a\u000aThe Gnocchi was amazing and the Carpaccio was awesome.

VWe played the Talon Course a few weeks ago.  I was super excited to finally play Grayhawk...it's on my list of AZ courses and I could check it off.  However, my excitement turned into disappointment by the end of the day.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a- No GPS.  What's with the courses out here in AZ???  Very few have GPS yardage markers on their carts.  \u000a\u000a- Crappy yardage markers.  Ok, so you don't have GPS, at least have decent yardage markers on the course....nope.  We had a difficult time gauging our distance during the round.  Yes, we ended up downloading an app to help out with that, but those things are not very reliable....we were 10-15 yds off all day.  Very frustrating.\u000a\u000a- Only 1 drink cart for 2 courses?!  Yes, it was blazing hot....100+ degrees and in 1 round only saw the drink cart twice!  Why?  She explained that she was the only drink cart serving both courses.....come on you cheapos, it's not that expensive to hire drink cart girls....it's very low cost labor and very noticeable to your customers....big disappointment.\u000a\u000a- The course itself was average, the greens average.  Everything was average.\u000a\u000aWith all of the problems above and an average course....it's a legit 2 Stars in my book.\u000a\u000aI hope they get their stuff together.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 20%

VI needed to fax a few documents and send out a FedEx package.  This location is closest to my house and is open pretty late.  I popped in here and was able to get both things done very fast.  The 2 pages I faxed cost $1.49 ea.  The FedEx package was prepaid by the company I was sending it to, so it was an easy dropoff situation.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VEnjoyed a nice dinner here with friends recently.  We sat in a booth and enjoyed a couple of glasses of Wine before dinner.  After browsing the menu, I decided to go with:\u000a\u000aSpinach & Artichoke Dip, $10\u000aBBQ Baby Back Ribs (w/Fries & Beans), $22\u000a\u000aThe Spinach & Artichoke Dip was pretty good.  We shared the dish between 4 people and it was enough for all of us.\u000a\u000aThe Baby Back Ribs were pretty good.  They fell right off the bone, just how I like them.  I wouldn't say they were the best I've ever had, but they were pretty good.\u000a\u000aThe service was very good as well.  The server realized that we were there to enjoy each other's company, so she didn't rush us.  She also made sure our glasses of Wine were never empty....a good way to stay on my good side!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 85%

VIt's been a while since I've eaten at a Sonic.  What drew me in was a coupon in the mail for 2 for 1 premium Hot Dogs.  They have a new menu of premium Hot Dogs and they looked very tempting, so I grabbed my coupon and headed for this location.\u000a\u000aI decided to order:\u000a\u000aChicago Hot Dog\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Crz3YPKbXdRzftigOr62_w?select=aQgi3VN_Cj_GKf6BsuD8CA\u000aNew York Hot Dog\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Crz3YPKbXdRzftigOr62_w?select=3vkk0sdl_Fv-soALmxy0lg\u000aCheeseburger\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Crz3YPKbXdRzftigOr62_w?select=xefpZG1PaZqwR9msB56xiw\u000a\u000aSince I'm a big fan of Chicago Dogs, I went for the Chicago Hot Dog first.  Based on it's appearance, it looked promising.....except the Relish wasn't colored Car Coolant Green like the real Dogs in Chicago.  I took a bite and was pleased.....it was "close", very close to a real Chicago Dog.\u000a\u000aNext up was the New York Dog.  It was OK, not as good as the Chicago Dog.\u000a\u000aThe Burger was OK too......better than most fast food joints.\u000a\u000aThe one weird thing about this restaurant location is that if you decide to dine inside, you order through a phone and someone from the back brings it out to you.....strange, very strange.\u000a\u000aOverall, not a bad fast food option.  Will come back for the Dogs again.  Gave it 4 Stars.....was really rounding up from 3.5.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 77%

VI've driven past this place several times and finally decided to drop in and give it a try.  After browsing their menu, I decided to order:\u000a\u000aCarne Asada Burrito, $4.75\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-burrito-scottsdale?select=eR3xIlBl1b5Cg2yTXHbGJw#eR3xIlBl1b5Cg2yTXHbGJw\u000a\u000aBeans/Rice/Cheese Burrito, $4.00\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-burrito-scottsdale?select=WOj1IM7axTeRw4yk49maVQ#WOj1IM7axTeRw4yk49maVQ\u000a\u000aWhile I waited for my food, I went to load up on Salsa.  They have a typical Salsa Bar that you find out here in the Phoenix area Taco shops.  I tried the spicy Salsa and the roasted Peppers Salsa.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-burrito-scottsdale?select=qPz2yJ8gswOPHTYerncIlA#qPz2yJ8gswOPHTYerncIlA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-burrito-scottsdale?select=AvDrycOxAXhouTAGL4COQg#AvDrycOxAXhouTAGL4COQg\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait my food was ready.  The Burritos are pretty large and come with Chips...that was an unexpected bonus.  Before I jumped into the Burritos, I tried the Chips...they were stale, yuck.\u000a\u000aI then went for the Carne Asada Burrito....took one bite and was underwhelmed.  There was very little flavor to it.  Ok, another bite....and then another.  Wow, this was the blandest Carne Asada Burrito I've ever had.  Another unique thing was that the Burrito had grilled Onions and Salsa in it....very runny for a Burrito like this.  However, that didn't help with the flavor at all.  As a matter of fact, I only ate 1/2 of it.\u000a\u000aNext, I tried the Beans/Rice/Cheese Burrito....again, it was underwhelming and bland.  I poured the spicy Salsa and Roasted Peppers Salsa on it to give it some flavor....that was it's only saving grace.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a very disappointing dining experience.  Oh well, it happens sometimes.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 2%

VI stumbled across this joint on the Yelp app when I was looking for a new place to try for lunch.  I must've driven by this place 1000 times and I've never noticed it....I'm glad Yelp guided me here.  It was a Saturday and the place was kind of busy.  After browsing the extensive menu on the wall, I decided to order:\u000a\u000aCarne Asada Burrito, $4.15\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fiesta-burrito-scottsdale?select=EwvshZHDNmhTyCwYd2NMGA#EwvshZHDNmhTyCwYd2NMGA\u000a\u000aBean and Cheese Burrito, $2.75\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fiesta-burrito-scottsdale?select=tKBbSicI8f2ZuXeBOTzN_w#tKBbSicI8f2ZuXeBOTzN_w\u000a\u000aWhile I was waiting for my food, I mozied over to the Salsa Bar to grab a few cups of Salsa.  I give their Salsa Bar 2 Stars...because they only have the runny Green & Red Sauces, Pickled Veggies, and Pico de Gallo.  There's no chunky Salsa or really hot Salsa available.....the runny Green and Red options are very mild.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fiesta-burrito-scottsdale?select=rlP4WQj7r8ZXiB0bz7zRSw#rlP4WQj7r8ZXiB0bz7zRSw\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait, my Burritos were ready.  I went for the Carne Asada first.  I took one bite and fell in love with it...it's a little different than most places like this in that they have Potatoes in the Burrito.  The Potatoes and Carne Asada create a unique flavor that tastes very good....kudos to them for putting this together!\u000a\u000aNext was the Bean & Cheese Burrito....that too was very good.\u000a\u000aOverall, the food here is 4 Stars...it's that good.  The lack of a hot Salsa option drops it down to 3.5 Stars, but I'm rounding up because I think they deserve it.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

I happened to be in the area, so I dropped by here to take a peek and see if there was anything worth picking up.\u000a\u000aThe store is mid-sized and very clean and organized.  They had some great deals on Sodas & Candy, so I picked up a 24 Pack of Coke Zero, a box of Mr Goodbars, and a box of Trident Gum.\u000a\u000aThere was hardly anyone in the store, so the checkout was fast and easy.  Friendly employees here too...a few asked if I needed any assistance.  I told them I was browsing and they pretty much left me alone after that.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 75%

A friend of mine invited me to have a few drinks and some dinner and I was intrigued, so I decided to go for it.\u000a\u000aWe sat at the bar and ordered glasses of Wine and some Oysters.  The bar was packed, but we were able to comfortably enjoy our food and have a conversation.  The food was OK.  The Wine was the house Zinfandel, which was *eh*....but I didn't like the call options, so whatever.....now I know not to order Wine here.\u000a\u000aOverall, it wasn't too bad of an experience.  Next time, I'll go with a Beer instead of Wine and try sitting in the dining room.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VWe've been to Antique Trove in the past and loved it.  This last visit was just as good.  The Better Half and my friend's wife methodically goes down every aisle.....while we (the guys) just wander aimlessly through the store driven by the dealers who sell the sports memorabilia.  \u000a\u000aThere's a dealer that has a few showcases on the center aisle that has a ton of autographed baseballs, baseball cards, photos, and stuff from the 1950's to now.....we can easily spend an hour looking at all of the stuff.  There are a couple of other dealers that have sports related items as well.\u000a\u000aAnother fun dealer is the one who has the vintage National Geographics and the dealer who has the vintage, used postcards.  We love to sift through those to see if we can find something interesting.  A few visits back our Son found a few National Geographics that was interested in....we struck out this time.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a fun hour or so that we spent in the Trove.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

There are aisles with individual dealer showcases and displays.\u000a\u000aYou can find furniture, jewelry, collectibles, and tons of vintage items.  Every once in a while, you might find a treasure or two.  Since we moved here a few years ago, we stop by frequently to see what they have here and have found great pieces of jewelry here.\u000a\u000aIt's a lot of fun to browse around.  For the guys who might get bored, there are a few showcases with sports memorabilia that might keep you interested.

So, I was pleasantly surprised to find this place when some friends invited me to a birthday party here.\u000a\u000aHere's why I like it:\u000a+ The bar is a small circle bar in the center of the joint.  \u000a+ It has 2 pool tables (space is kind of tight though).\u000a+ It has character.  The regulars in there look like they've been coming into the joint every day for decades.  The bartenders have a little attitude.\u000a+ I love the name...it just sounds cool.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a fun night.  Can't wait to go back.

VAn Italian grocery store & deli?!

There's not too many tables/seats inside and while there are a few located on the patio outside, it can get real hot there during the Summer months.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a great Sammie and I always look forward to dining here.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 87%

The drive thru lane can get slow and jammed up....there's not much room for more than 2 or 3 cars to be in line at the ordering speaker before it starts getting messy.\u000a\u000aOne convenient aspect of this location is that there's a gas station attached to it.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VThe Fiesta Bowl is one of the greatest college football events I've ever been to.  Everything from the organization of the pre-game tailgate parties, to the execution of the parking before/after the game is well done.  Not to mention that the football is great too.\u000a\u000aThere are 2 large tailgate party areas that are part of the event.  The "College Football's Largest Tailgate" is the area most people go to and costs $30 to get in.  Food and Beverage is not included with the ticket price.  You have to purchase that with cash at bars and food stations once you get in.  It's on a concrete lot and there's plenty of tables and seating areas.  There are several areas where corporate sponsors host games and interactive booths.  There's also a band the plays on a small stage.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fiesta-bowl-tempe?select=hO9o7TcYg4XQflLeuc_dYg#hO9o7TcYg4XQflLeuc_dYg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fiesta-bowl-tempe?select=MKwYQ045WDgxhWoMqtYcZA#MKwYQ045WDgxhWoMqtYcZA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fiesta-bowl-tempe?select=TWRPE0C9If_iCsNYERZA1g#TWRPE0C9If_iCsNYERZA1g\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fiesta-bowl-tempe?select=v8Cw9UcfpebM9NwXI8bt5Q#v8Cw9UcfpebM9NwXI8bt5Q\u000a\u000aAdjacent to that tailgate is the VIP tailgate party called "The Stadium Club".  Tickets are $100 to get in to this party.  With your ticket, you get up to 7 alcoholic beverages and a meal.  It's on a grass area and there are also plenty of seats and tables.  There's a band here as well and a few games.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fiesta-bowl-tempe?select=l34vuy13z-SJJELSHQOjqA#l34vuy13z-SJJELSHQOjqA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fiesta-bowl-tempe?select=TXdPPSZq_KP5F0GH4X8gmg#TXdPPSZq_KP5F0GH4X8gmg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fiesta-bowl-tempe?select=A5MDjP1M99JBsaolvO0IQg#A5MDjP1M99JBsaolvO0IQg\u000a\u000aBoth teams who participate in the Fiesta Bowl will send their marching band & cheer squad to both areas so it's kind of cool to watch the pre-game excitement of it all.\u000a\u000aThe game speaks for itself.  Over the past 2 years I've seen 2 great games with Oklahoma State beating Stanford in OT in 2012 and Kansas State getting embarrassed by Oregon in 2013.  Both were awesome to watch.  We watched both from a suite on the 200 level, which were perfect for viewing.  In this year's Fiesta Bowl, there were plenty of empty suites, so I suggest inquiring about getting one if you ever plan to come out and watch your favorite team.  It's a very comfortable way to watch the game.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fiesta-bowl-tempe?select=ZlYONOPMtztZuDjOM8aTFg#ZlYONOPMtztZuDjOM8aTFg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fiesta-bowl-tempe?select=LNYVD2LsUbxT-ki-5dCsfw#LNYVD2LsUbxT-ki-5dCsfw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fiesta-bowl-tempe?select=ipTGztxHSYYEeBCViso2_Q#ipTGztxHSYYEeBCViso2_Q\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 99%

VI came here for the first time to meet a client for lunch.  He selected this place because it was convenient for him and his office location.  Since I don't come down to Tempe very often, I didn't realize that there's free parking for this place if you dine here...so instead, I paid for metered parking down the street because it's hard to find parking in this part of Tempe during lunch.\u000a\u000aAfter reviewing the menu, we decided to split Chips & Salsa, $5 for an appetizer and I ordered a Hickory Burger, $10.75.  The Chips & Salsa was pretty good but the Burger was excellent!  Not only is it full of flavor, but it's huge and juicy....great tasting, but I shouldn't have had it for a business lunch....it could've been a disaster because it's pretty messy.  I lucked out and didn't get it on my clothes.  Next time, I will order it for dinner.\u000a\u000aService was good and the lunch was successful.  Looks like this place would be fun for happy hour...will have to give that a try sometime.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VA friend of mine visiting from California stayed here one weekend.  I went to pick him up at his hotel room.  It was the first time I've been to a Red Roof Inn and I wasn't impressed.  The room was large, but it wasn't well appointed and very bland.   The elevator didn't work very well, it "stuttered" and gave me a sense that you could get stuck between floors....not saying that it would do that, but it gave me that uneasy feeling.\u000a\u000aI asked him why he selected this place and he said it was because it was cheap.  He didn't like the beds and didn't sleep well.  For the traveler on a budget, it would probably work fine.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 30%

VLocated in Tempe on Mill Ave next to ASU, I would never have found this location.  However, a Groupon brought me here.  Since I love Fatburger, I couldn't resist.  I ordered a Dbacks Double Cheeseburger combo meal which included Skinny Fries and a Med Drink for $10.29.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fatburger-tempe-2?select=vL82qa-aXQzv-vRpL31tLw#vL82qa-aXQzv-vRpL31tLw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fatburger-tempe-2?select=vSRn9_Ir5QPyjtC02et9sQ#vSRn9_Ir5QPyjtC02et9sQ\u000a\u000aIf you've never been to a Fatburger before, it takes a while for them to prepare the Burger because they make it fresh.  The food is awesome.  The Burger is huge and juicy....full of flavor.  I left stuffed and satisfied.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VSome colleagues and I stopped by here for lunch recently.  After browsing the menu, I decided on the Kobe Sliders, $10.95 that came with a side of Onion Strings.  The food came out pretty fast.  The Sliders were very good....and the Onion Strings were delish!\u000a\u000aOur server was very friendly and attentive to our table.  Our Iced Teas and Water glasses were never empty.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a great lunch.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 85%

VI've never stayed in the rooms, this review is of their conference center.\u000a\u000aI've attended several ASU Football events here.  When they stage the events, they setup a special valet parking setup on the right side of the hotel so you can drop your car off at the entrance of one of the ballrooms.  It's very convenient to get in/out this way.  The banquet food is pretty good and the servers are always courteous.  They go out of their way to make sure you're having a good time.\u000a\u000aHowever, the hallway space in front of the ballroom is too small.  When they setup a registration desk, bar, and merchandise sales areas it gets very crowded with people.\u000a\u000aTheir location in the heart of campus is their strongest characteristic.  Next football season I plan to get a room during one of the home games so I can easily walk to/from the stadium.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VI will feature the State I've called home for the past few years for my 1900th review.  Here's a breakdown of this State:\u000a\u000aPro's\u000a+ Warm weather.  The Southern part of the State is warm for the majority of the year...sure beats shoveling snow and wearing layers of clothing.\u000a\u000a+ Sports.  There are a ton of sports in this State.....college, pro's (NFL, MLB, NBA, WNBA, NHL, Arena Football), Fiesta Bowl, Phoenix Open (golf), Spring Training Cactus League.\u000a\u000a+ Scottsdale.  I love living in this city.  It's safe and fun.  A great place to raise a family.\u000a\u000a+ They have frequent gun shows.  It seems like there's one every month.  The gun laws here are not very strict and gun enthusiasts are everywhere.  I've come to appreciate guns a lot since I've moved here.\u000a\u000a+ Hiking options.  There are a lot of hiking trails in the State with a nice variety of landscape.  From mountains and pine trees to dry Sonoran Desert dirt and Saguaro cacti, there's something for everyone here.\u000a\u000a+ Western lifestyle.  There are some places in Arizona where you feel like you're in the Wild West.\u000a\u000a\u000aCon's\u000a- State Income Tax.  Coming from a state that had no state income tax, it's hard to swallow the fact that we have to pay a % of our income to the State.\u000a\u000a- Politics.  There's so much politics here and it carries over into everyday life.\u000a\u000a- Drivers.  The drivers here in Arizona are baffling.  They slow down BELOW the speed limit for no reason on the highways.  People rubberneck over the dumbest things.....cars pulled over on the shoulder, cops on the side of the road, curves in the freeway.\u000a\u000a- Slow life.  Stores, restaurants, bars close early here.....yawn.  I get bored very easily out here.\u000a\u000a- Lack of good Asian food.  Can't find very many good Pho or Ramen places.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's not too bad a place to live.  I've lived in more exciting places, but it could be worse.  It's definitely worth visiting if you've never been here before.

VI won a bid at silent auction for a $150 gift certificate to this place.  Located in Tempe and buried on the ASU Campus, this was not a restaurant that we'd normally stumble upon.  However, I am very happy that I bid on this even though I knew nothing about it...why?  Because the food here is fantastic!  Here's what we ordered:\u000a\u000aKorean Style Baby Back Ribs, $14\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=WDPYIOgCMIM-dJnKrKaMZA#WDPYIOgCMIM-dJnKrKaMZA\u000a\u000aYukon Gold Potato Gnocchi, King Mushroom, $23\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=2MsbjsZvu2hO1yeon7slaQ#2MsbjsZvu2hO1yeon7slaQ\u000a\u000aGrilled Filet w/Smoked Cheddar Bits, Asparagus, Cabernet Sauce, Crispy Onions, $36\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=LoIz5HIBcKYZcdOsoL2CAQ#LoIz5HIBcKYZcdOsoL2CAQ\u000a\u000aGrand Marnier Creme Brulee, $6.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=exAY1Qtwhzc2LmQNZZxjFQ#exAY1Qtwhzc2LmQNZZxjFQ\u000a\u000aDouble Chocolate Bacon Cake w/White Chocolate Butter Cream & Candied Bacon, $6.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=DquWbL5b-Xb625mfyM95SA#DquWbL5b-Xb625mfyM95SA\u000a\u000aThe Korean Style Baby Back Ribs were simply amazing!  The BBQ Sauce was sweet & tangy with just the right amount of Ginger.  Yum!\u000a\u000aAs everyone who knows me knows that I love Gnocchi....the Gnocchi here is delish.  The Grilled Filet was very good as well.  But the best part of dinner was the Dessert....\u000a\u000aThe Better Half had the Grand Marnier Creme Brulee, which I sampled and was very good.  However, the best of the best was the Double Chocolate Bacon Cake w/White Chocolate Butter Cream & Candied Bacon....yes, that's right Bacon lovers!  This Dessert delivers the goods on all levels.....it's Chocolatey, Sweet, and the Bacon adds a little salty/meaty goodness that causes your palette to jump for joy....my mouth is watering right now.\u000a\u000aThere were 3 things that kept me from giving this place 5 Stars:\u000a\u000a1 - Parking.  It sucks.  Jockeying for position against ASU student parking plus the customers for this place and area businesses is not fun.  They should offer a valet service up front just for customers....I'd pay $5-$10 just to avoid the nonsense.\u000a\u000a2 - Seating.  We were seated outside....not our preference, but the size of the interior of the restaurant is tiny and we were told the wait was long to sit inside.  They have a huge outdoor seating area with giant trees.  We were sat at a table for 2, the table was very small and the servers had trouble with space when we had a bottle of Wine, Appetizers, and Bread.  When then entrees came out, it was a circle jerk to rotate old plate off, etc.  The furniture is patio furniture and the pads of the seats are left out overnight, dusty.  There was a lot of bird shit on the wall next to where we were seated and fallen leaves all around us.....I was constantly worried about something dropping onto my food.  It was our decision to accept sitting outside, so it's on me.  If I come back, will definitely not sit outside, don't care how nice the weather is.  \u000a\u000a3 - Service.  It was so/so.  We had to flag our waiter down when we were ready to order Wine....a huge pet peeve of mine.  Also, had to flag him down to order our food and refill Wine and Water glasses.  I think the majority of the wait staff here are ASU students.....they look young and don't know how to provide proper service.  When we walked up, we didn't know where to go because the hostess stand is outside and isn't obvious....2 hostesses looked at us and didn't say "Hi, how can we help you" or anything at all.  It was only when we started to wander around the patio area that they said "are you looking for someone?"....LMAO, yes I'm trying to get seated in your restaurant!  Too bad because the food is outstanding.\u000a\u000aI will give it another try and see how it goes now that I know about the things to avoid.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 75%

VAwesome place to watch a hockey game or concert.  It's a modern facility that accommodates large crowds very well.  The food options and flow of foot traffic makes it very convenient.  \u000a\u000aHowever, the one complaint I have is parking.  There's no logical place to park.  You have to park somewhere in the adjacent shopping center, but they protect some of those spaces for shoppers, so you have to find these lots that are surrounding the area and none of the parking is relatively close to the Arena.  I pay the $20 to $30 to valet park my car so I don't have to deal with the nonsense.  However, I wish there was a better way.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VFun golf course tucked away in Cave Creek.  It's in BFE and a super far drive away from civilization.  However, it's worth the drive.  It's a little cooler here during the summer time than the rest of the Valley.\u000a\u000aThere are some great views of the area with some of the holes you're teeing off an elevated tee.

It's pretty large and is a great place for a group to meetup after a golf tournament or hike.\u000a\u000aWe've never eaten here, just dropped in to imbibe.  The servers here are cute and friendly.  You'll frequently see a lot of bikers here, especially on the weekends.  We like to bring friends here to give them a feel for Arizona country drinking.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VThanks to Living Social we found this place....all the way up at the top of Cave Creek, you have to drive through a neighborhood and then a dirt road.  This wasn't very clearly marked and the road on the Google Maps app on my phone looked like it ended in the mountains....thought we were lost at one point.  We stopped by a stable looking place, but there was a lady tending the horses and she said it was a little further down...LOL, where were we?\u000a\u000aAnyway, we found the stable and checked in with the guide.  They ask if you'd like a safety helmet.  If you decline, you have to sign a waiver.  We signed the waivers and waited with everyone else for our horse assignment.  After a few minutes a guide came out and told us to head to the stable to get a horse....we were on an elevated walkway so we could easily get on the horse.\u000a\u000aOnce we were all on, we went on a 90 min ride through the hills in the area.  The weather wasn't too hot yet and it was in the morning, so it was relatively comfortable during the ride.  It's the Sonoran Desert, so there's not much to look at besides Saguaro cactus, tumbleweeds, and other desert plants.  Besides the occasional bird or ground squirrel, there wasn't much wildlife on the ride.\u000a\u000aThe guide was pretty cool and informed us of the plants in the area.  The people we were with were alright and the horses behaved themselves.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a fun day out horseback riding.  It's great for beginners and intermediate riders.  Probably too boring for a more experienced rider.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

Here's what I think about the airport:\u000a\u000aPros\u000a- FREE WiFi\u000a- Good selection of restaurants\u000a- Easy to get in/out\u000a- Easy to get a cab, limo, or bus\u000a- Logical layout\u000a- Security lines move quickly despite being very long\u000a- You can gamble while you wait for your flight\u000a- International gates are very convenient to get in/out\u000a\u000aCons\u000a- Shopping is sub-par compared to other airports\u000a- International flights are in a separate area\u000a\u000aI love our airport, can you tell?

VI travel on Southwest Airlines on 2 or 3 round trips per month.  For the money, they are a great airline.  Since I use them mostly for shorter trips, I don't have any issues with no assigned seats or full service amenities.\u000a\u000aI've never lost a bag with them....(knock on wood)....and like how I can check more than 1 bag with no additional fees.  The only complaint regarding bags is that if I'm a 1/2 lb over the 50 lb limit, they sometimes make me take out stuff to make it 50 lbs.....seriously?  I hate when it happens.\u000a\u000aOverall I enjoy flying with them.

VOn a recent trip to Orange County I had an issue with my checked baggage.  I flew during the December rain storms and when I picked up my bag at baggage claim, it was soaking wet.  I realize that bags are outside for a period of time during transport, so I didn't think much of it, until.....\u000a\u000aI got home and discovered that the inside of my bag was soaking wet too!  All of my clothes were soaked or damp.  I was trying to figure out what happened when I realized that my flight was delayed 2 hrs in Orange County and it was pouring rain....the bags must have been sitting on the runway exposed to the rain.  I didn't mind the clothes getting soaked, but I had 2 textbooks that got damaged.\u000a\u000aI promptly called Southwest Airlines and they asked how much they were worth.  I told them I checked on Amazon.com and that the replacement cost was $117 for both books.  They checked on their computer to verify it....once they did, they said "come on down and we'll write a check for $117".\u000a\u000aThe next day I brought my damaged textbooks to the baggage claim office at the airport and they promptly wrote me a check for $117 after verifying the damaged books.  Awesome!\u000a\u000aOne quick tip:  If you fly Southwest and have any issues with your bags, you have 4 hours from the time your flight arrives to report the issue, otherwise you can't file a claim with them.  I was lucky that I noticed right away and called them in just under 2 hours.\u000a\u000aKudos to Southwest!

VYes, I got another ticket.  So, I came down to CPK & Associates to take care of it.  For $50, they will handle everything for you, except paying the fine.  \u000a\u000aThey informed me that Las Vegas Municipal Court is no longer negotiating the fines, so the fine is the same whether I use them or not.....they gave me an opportunity to handle it myself.  I chose to have them take care of it.  $50 is worth the time it would take for me to call/show up to handle it on my own.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a nice service to have when you get a ticket.  I'm walking away with no points on my driving record and no traffic school....~whew~\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - I hope 0%, in reality 70%.

VMy family from Hawaii always stay at the California Hotel when they come out to Vegas 2 or 3 times a year.  Although they are here frequently, it has been a couple of years since we've eaten at this restaurant.  I was in the mood for some Saimin so we headed down to meet them here for lunch.\u000a\u000aI ordered a small bowl of Saimin ($5.99) and a Teri-Burger ($6.99).  Their definition of "small" is Hawaiian Small.....which means H-U-G-E!  The bowl of Saimin was about a 1/2 gallon.  It was tasty as usual.  The Teri-Burger was very good too.....it comes with a side of Macaroni Salad....but I didn't try it, I was too stuffed.\u000a\u000aA couple of tips if you are going to visit this place:\u000a\u000a- It gets very crowded during Lunch and Dinner hours, so it's best to go between those meal periods.\u000a\u000a- It's a self service restaurant where you order at the counter and they either call your number or take it to your table.\u000a\u000a- You can order take out.\u000a\u000a- There is fresh iced water in jugs on the right side of the restaurant.....I didn't see this and ordered bottled Water.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was another good meal at Aloha Specialties....I got my Saimin fix for a while.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet I will.

VOnce upon a time, this place was the mecca for gamblers downtown....that was until Jack Binion gave it to his sister Becky.  Since then, it's been run down, closed, sold to Harrah's, the World Series of Poker moved to the Rio, and sold to another owner.....it's a shell of it's former self.  No longer is it worth the trip to see it.  Sad.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 10%

VTime to update my review.  This place has continued it's downward spiral.  It hasn't improved one bit since my last review.  It's actually gotten worse.  It's dirty, smoky, and the people who hang out here are sketchy. We dropped in for a drink to check out the place on our last trip to Vegas and we could barely stay long enough to finish it.\u000a\u000aI have fond memories of the old Horseshoe.  It used to be the place to gamble downtown.  Now, it's become one of the worst places downtown.  Benny Binion has to be rolling over in his grave right now.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 2%

VI come down here to see family when they visit from Hawaii.  It's their favorite place to stay.  Was here last week and the property still looks the same as it did the last time I was here.  For those who are unfamiliar with this property, here are some highlights:\u000a\u000a- It's mostly full of Hawaiians.  This is where the 9th Island was started.....you can thank this place for all of the Hawaiian food and people in Vegas.\u000a\u000a- It's not a high end property, but it's consistent in it's quality and service.....has been this way for decades.  I would say it's a 2 1/2 to 3 Star hotel (not Yelp Stars).\u000a\u000a- Decent gambling options....on the 2nd floor they have some old Video Poker machines that take real quarters.....decent payout table too.  This casino is also know for it's Craps games.  The longest recorded roll of Craps (almost 4 hours) happened here.\u000a\u000a- There's a wall of fame for people who have rolled a long hand of Craps (over 1 hour) on the walkway between Main St Station & the California.\u000a\u000a- The sister property Main St Station is connected to this hotel via an indoor walkway on the 2nd floor....very convenient to go back/forth.\u000a\u000a- Parking is FREE.....that's right, FREE Parking downtown.\u000a\u000aI always hanging out here with my family.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet!

VLocated on the Fremont St Experience next to the Horseshoe and across from the Four Queens, the Fremont Hotel & Casino is another one of Boyd Gaming's properties that cater to mostly Hawaiians.  It's real obvious when you walk into the joint and 75% of the people in there are from Hawaii.  They also have a restaurant, Lanai Express, that caters to Hawaiian tastes.\u000a\u000aParking is FREE at this hotel, only if you get your ticket validated by getting a stamp at one of the time clocks in the casino.  It's valet parking too, there's no self-parking option....keep that in mind.\u000a\u000aYou can always find a good game of Craps going on here as Hawaiians love to play Craps.  Machines are ok....they're a bit older.  You won't find too many new slot machines here.  The rooms are ok by downtown standards, not great.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  My family from Hawaii stay here on occasion.  So I come back whenever they visit.

It's still one of the most convenient places to valet park in downtown Vegas....so that's why we come here.  It's centrally located to everything on Fremont St and easy to access.  All of my comments from my previous review still apply here, but they get downgraded a Star because of how dirty/smoky it is here.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 30%

VThe crown jewel of downtown Las Vegas, this is my favorite property in this area.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a- They remodeled the property a few years ago and upgraded their swimming pool area.   There's a water slide and multi level area to the pool....very cool to hang out during the Summer months.\u000a\u000a- The dining options are some of the best in the downtown area.\u000a\u000a- The casino is the cleanest, most well kept casino in downtown.  It's almost as nice as some of the Strip properties.\u000a\u000a- It's classy.  Despite being in downtown, the Golden Nugget has remained a classy joint.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I meet friends and colleagues here for lunch on occasion, so I'm here 4 to 5 times a year....so you can count on it.

VOne of the first locals casinos in Las Vegas, this place was started in the 70's and once upon a time had sawdust on the floor!  This is a great place to bring friends and family who like to gamble.  There's a HUGE selection of table games, video poker machines, and slot machines that have low betting minimums and variety.\u000a\u000aIf you're looking for the chic, hip, party spots, this is not the property for you.  The food here is ok and low priced.  No high end joints here.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a nice place if you want to gamble or are looking for a good priced hotel room.  It's far from the Strip (15 min by car), so don't expect to use this as an alternative to staying on the Strip.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Eventually.

VThis is easily my favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas.  The chips and salsa are great.....both are home made and the salsa is very spicy.....just the way I like it.  It is not for the weak.\u000a\u000aMy favorite dishes are:\u000aQueso Fundido w/Chorizo - Basically a cheese appetizer with chorizo served on a hot fajita plate.  Comes with flour or corn tortillas....this is very good.  I order this when I take friends to this restaurant for the 1st time and every one of them agree with me.\u000a\u000aCarne Asada Burrito - Very tasty, good quality Carne Asada.\u000a\u000aInside their menu, they have a lot of dishes to choose from....not to mention an extensive combo menu where there are a lot of combo dishes.....I have tried at least 7 or 8 different combos...all are very good.\u000a\u000aWe go to this restaurant at least 1 to 2 times per month for lunch at work and 1 time per month for dinner.  The prices are very reasonable too.

VEasily the best pizza in Las Vegas.  There are so many different types of pizza to choose from!  If you love pizza, this is it.......you can get Chicago Style Deep Dish.....New York style thin, where you must fold the slice.....Sicilian style......whatever you like.  It's awesome and always packed.  I recommend showing up early or late....if you show up during peak lunch or dinner hours you'll be waiting a while.  it's worth the wait though.

VWas very excited to visit Ferraro's for the first time last night.  Although I've lived in Vegas for 17 years, I've never been to Ferraro's.\u000a\u000aA good friend was hosting a party there to celebrate the launch of his new company.  For hors d'oeuvre we were served slices of Cheese Pizza, Sausage Pizza, Risotto Balls, and Sausage w/Marinara Sauce.....all of them were awesome.\u000a\u000aOnce we were seated, we were served Gnocchi w/Marinara Sauce & Penne Pasta with Bolognese Sauce for Appetizers.  For a Salad we were served a salad w/Heirloom Tomatoes, Mozzarella, Balsamic Vinegar, Avocado, and Red Onion.....this was soooo good too!  For an Entree, I chose the Filet w/Wild Mushrooms in a Veal demi-glaze reduction while the Better Half chose the Fresh Seabass.....a couple of friends ordered Ferraro's World Famous Oso Buco......we loved them all!\u000a\u000aAnd to finish the dinner, we had Tiramisu & Cannolis....what!!!  I think I died and went to heaven!\u000a\u000aPlus the wine was free flowing all night long.....I can't remember how many glasses I put away.....ha!\u000a\u000aI hate to sound like such a Homer, but this was a really really good experience from beginning to end.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  F-U-H-G-E-T-T-A 'B-O-U-T I-T!

VOnce upon a time this was a great local place.  However, age has caught up to it and it's not the place it once was.  The place smells like cigarette smoke and it's lost it's vibe and energy.  The two redeeming things about the joint is Ping Pang Pong (Chinese Restaurant) and their Bowling Alley.\u000a\u000aWe use to come here to grab late night grub in the coffee shop, but the food has gone downhill in there, so we stopped coming to eat here a few years ago.\u000a\u000aThe one thing about this place is that the room rates are always cheap.  But remember, you get what you pay for.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 30%

VOk, it's time to update this review.  We stayed here for 3 nights on a recent Vegas trip and during all 3 nights, at least 1 elevator was out of order which caused a traffic jam to go up/down the hotel tower.  It took FOREVER to get back to our room!  Besides that, all of the same things are still here....bad cigarette smoke and the food options are terrible....except for Ping Pang Pong, which is the only reason why I gave this place 2 Stars instead of 1.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor 10% (to eat at Ping Pang Pong)

VOnce upon a time this was my favorite casino to hang out at.  When I first moved here in 1993, this was more of a locals joint than a tourist spot.  Now, it's more of a tourist spot than a locals joint.\u000a\u000aThe last time we were here, we came to meet friends for drinks at the Voodoo Lounge.  It's the same lounge that I remember, but it lacked the vibe and energy it once had.\u000a\u000aDespite the decline and aging of the hotel, The Better Half and I enjoy Staycations here.  Several times during the year we'll be able to find a great rate and we'll getaway from the house for a few days.  The rooms are spacious and the view of the Strip is great.  \u000a\u000aThe restaurants here are ok, they aren't as good as they use to be.....don't know why.  The highlight of this place is Steve Martarano's joint......I love the pasta there!\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a great value if you can find low rates.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VI use to shop at this Smiths all the time when I first moved to Vegas in 1993.  However, since I've moved to a different part of town, I rarely stop by anymore.  Since I had lunch at Laduca's Deli, which is in the same shopping center, I decided to stop in here to grab some stuff for the house.\u000a\u000aThe store is well organized and clean.  I was able to easily find what I was looking for.  The checkout process was fast and the cashier was friendly.  What more could I ask for?\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

VThere are only a few Front Row Sports stores in Vegas.  This happens to be the one located nearest to my home.  Located at the Meadows Mall, there is easy access to this store if you park on the North side of the Mall which has you enter and exit on the 2nd floor.\u000a\u000aThis is one of my "go to" spots for Football Jerseys.  Last year I bought a USC Jersey (Grad School) and this past weekend I bought a UNLV Jersey (Undergrad).  Their selection of Jerseys is large and they carry unique items at this location that the others don't.  For example, last year this location was the only one that had a USC Football Jersey.  This weekend, while I was purchasing the UNLV Jersey the guy pointed out a USC dry-fit shirt that they just got in and said they were the only store to carry it.  So.....I bought it!  Dammit, I hate when that happens.....sales guy did his job!\u000a\u000aThere were a ton of other stuff too....they just got in the new Lakers gear, but I had to get out before I started spending too much money.  I love my sports teams and can easily get caught up with all the merchandise.  I paid quickly and ran out to my car.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Most likely.

VWent to Vegas for a weekend to clean up a rental home after a tenant vacated it and of course I trashed my clothes on the first day.  So, I need to go shopping for some cheap clothes to get me through the rest of the weekend.  Dropped by this store to pick up some t-shirts and sweat pants....mission accomplished.  Got everything I needed for under $15....it's easy when you're not picky, ha!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VThere are so many other shopping choices in Vegas.  This mall is not high on my list, but since it's the closest mall to the Northwest part of Las Vegas, where I live, I shop here two or three times a year.  This past weekend, I was searching for a UNLV Football Jersey.  Because I didn't want to drive all the way across town, I stopped here.\u000a\u000aHere's the breakdown of the mall from my perspective:\u000a\u000aPROS\u000a- It's conveniently located off US-95 and can be accessed via two exits, Valley View Blvd or Decatur.\u000a\u000a- There is a parking area on the North part of the mall that has the fewest number of cars and will get you in/out of the center of the mall.  Very easy access.\u000a\u000a- They renovated the mall a few years back and it's relatively clean.  Much nicer than it was 5-10 yrs ago.\u000a\u000a- They have a Front Row Sports, which was the main reason for coming here, that has a great selection of sports clothing & jerseys.\u000a\u000aCONS\u000a- It's not in a great neighborhood and coming here at night is not advised.\u000a\u000a- I wouldn't purchase anything expensive here, see point above.\u000a\u000aThe two Cons are pretty big, but if you have some common sense you can navigate through those....like I said I only come here when I'm too lazy to drive across town.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I probably will.

VAnother casino that hasn't aged well, this is not one of my favorite places in Vegas.  I only come here when friends force me to meet them here when they visit.  The most recent visit reminded me why I don't like this place:\u000a\u000a- It feels dirty.  I'm not going to say it's a dirty place, but it feels like it.....you know how a place looks/feels when it hasn't been taken care of well?\u000a\u000a- The customers.  Many of the customers were rude and had a lot of attitude....this isn't the streets.\u000a\u000aThe only thing I enjoy about the Excalibur is the Tournament of Kings Dinner/Show.  It's a little entertaining and the food is OK.....it's the only thing that kept me from giving the Excalibur 1 Star.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 17%

VI am torn on writing this review.  There are two sections of this review that add up to the 3 Star Rating.  Here it goes....\u000a\u000aConvention Facility - 4 Stars\u000aThe Las Vegas Convention Center is a very good facility compared to other cities.  I've been to the Dallas & San Diego convention centers recently and they aren't as nice as Las Vegas.  The facility is in great shape, the South Hall is relatively new and parking isn't too bad between the area parking lots and the Las Vegas Hilton next door.\u000a\u000aFood - 2 Stars\u000aThis is where it gets ugly.  The food offerings here are split into two distinct groups......the Franchise & the Non-Franchise options...\u000a\u000aThe Franchise options receive anywhere from a 3 to 4 Star rating.  They have Starbucks, Nathan's Hot Dogs, Sbarro, and a Capriotti's To Go.  On my recent visit this past week, I ate at all 3 of them and can tell you that Nathan's Dogs were the best of the 3.  Sbarro is a close second.  Starbucks is Starbucks....nothing special there.....and the Capriotti's To Go is a good option for quick eating on the Tradeshow Floor, but is nowhere near as a good as the regular restaurant.\u000a\u000aThe Non-Franchise food options get a deserving 1 Star from me.  The food is just awful.....and I mean nasty.  I tried two Cheeseburgers from the grill in the main food court area between the Main Hall and the North Hall.....they were easily the most disgusting Cheeseburgers I've ever had in my life.  Seriously, they were worse than the boiled garbage we were served in High School....and damn, those Burgers were crap.  The convention center Burgers were Bland, the top of the Bun was rock hard and tasted stale, and the bottom of the bun was wet & soggy from being prepped in the back kitchen for so long with the special sauce & tomatoes sitting on top of it so by the time the Burger was served the Bun & Toppings were just an awful mess....disgusting!\u000a\u000aI will never again eat at the Non-Franchise food outlets at the convention center....proceed with caution my friends.\u000a\u000aOk, so if you add all of those ratings up....it levels out to 3 Stars overall in my book.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I attend so many trade shows, it's kind of hard to avoid....but I enjoy the convention center, so I will definitely return.

VOver the past few years they've lost large conventions to the Sands Expo Center.  The economy has hit this place pretty hard.  The facility hasn't been upgraded in quite some time and as I pointed out in my prior review 3 yrs ago, the food options here are terrible.  I attend 3 to 4 conventions here a year and I dread getting hungry while on the convention floor.  The choices for having business meetings over lunch and/or drinks is non-existent.  Who wants to try and close a deal in a food court?  Come on...\u000a\u000aHopefully, that changes soon with the economy making a rebound, otherwise convention centers in other cities will catch up to this place.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100% (only because I have to)

VI love this place.  We eat lunch here often.\u000a\u000aFood - During my most recent visit, I had:\u000a\u000a- Stuffed Dates...very yummy w/bacon.\u000a- Ham & Cheese Croquetas...one of my favs.\u000a- Vegetable Empinada....1st time trying it, was ok.\u000a- Stuffed Mushrooms...another one of my favs.\u000a- Firefly Fries.....you can't go here and not get these...they are addicting!\u000a\u000aThe weather was awesome, so we ate on the patio....just a great experience.  Hard to find in Vegas.\u000a\u000aService - The service here is always spectacular.  They are very attentive to your needs and make sure you're taken care of.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Absolutely!

VLocated in the center of the Strip, this hotel is convenient for tourists who want to be in the middle of the action and have good access to all parts of the Strip.  The property is kind of dated and old, but they maintain it well.  It caters primarily to gamblers.....there aren't too many other frills here and you won't find any night clubs or ultra lounges.\u000a\u000aA few years ago, we would come to Toby Keith's for lunch and then walk to the Carnival Bar between the Imperial Palace & Harrah's to hang out and have a few drinks.  When we were there a few weeks ago, we did the same thing and enjoyed people watching on the Strip.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a great place if you're a gambler....their slot club will give you tons of comps and free rooms if you're a serious slot player.  Other than that, you can pass on visiting the property and you won't be missing out on the Vegas experience.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VI heard about this place on Yelp Talk Vegas and thought I'd give it a try for lunch today.  It's located in an older, ethnic area of Vegas that has a large Hispanic population, so I thought I was on the right track.  I was excited as I pulled into the parking lot.  I couldn't wait to get inside and try it out.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant is small with about 4 tables for 16 people and counter seating for another 8-10 people.  It sounds like a lot, but it's crammed into a small area where chairs are back to back....very tight space.\u000a\u000aThe menu is pretty extensive, but I found it shocking that they don't have Burritos on the menu......WHAT??!!!  One of my favorite dishes and they don't have it.....oh well, I didn't give them a strike for that.  I saw that they had the bottled Mexican Orange Soda that I L-O-V-E, so I bought a bottle with the meal.\u000a\u000aI opted for an Asada Torta & a Cheese Quesadilla (it sounds redundant & I hate saying it, but that's what was on menu).....thought I'd try two items because I was hungry and I wanted to get a good feel for their food.\u000a\u000aThe tables have the standard Mexican Red & Green Salsa on the table for your convenience....homemade, which is a plus.  When the food came out, I was kind of disappointed with the size of the Torta, but it's about quality not quantity, so I won't dock them for that.  They also brought out a small bowl of pickled peppers, almost like Italian Giardiniera peppers....cool, I love those.  However, the Asada was very tough and bland....Strike 1.  It was pretty flavorless....so I had to add a lot of the pickled peppers & hot sauce to make it palatable....Strike 2.\u000a\u000aWhen they brought out the Quesadilla I was surprised to see that it was deep fried and looked like an Empanada (see pics).....looked better than it tasted though.  It too was bland!  Wow!  I couldn't believe it.....so again, I doused it with hot sauce and finished it because I was starving....Strike 3.\u000a\u000aI really really really wanted to like this place, but the food was just too bland.....I tried 2 items and it was a bust.  Damn, that's too bad.\u000a\u000aWill I come back?  I'm torn....maybe to try the Tacos and give them a chance for redemption.

VThis place really needs to be imploded.  It is old and past it's heyday.  Not only that, but I think every gang member that visits from Los Angeles stays here....it's that bad.\u000a\u000aThe only two things preventing me from giving it one star is Adventure Dome (for Fright Dome @ Halloween) and The Steakhouse (one of the best in town).....which is really sad because I remember how cool this place was when I was a little kid who use to stay here when we visited from California in the 80's.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Only for the 2 things I outlined above.

VWhy did I walk back into this place?  I knew it was going to be a disappointment before I went there....but my friends insisted on checking it out for old times sake.  Maybe I though it has improved since I moved away from Vegas a few years ago....or perhaps I was holding on to the past when I remembered this place as a fun joint...silly me.\u000a\u000aThe place is smoky and the crowd here is rough.  I didn't feel safe walking to/from the parking lot.\u000a\u000aThe slot machines were busy and we didn't want to pull out our money on the blackjack tables with the rough looking crowd for fear we'd get jacked in the parking lot.  We wanted to go to the Steakhouse for dinner, but we just couldn't stand being on the property, so we decided to leave and go somewhere else.  \u000a\u000aI'm not coming back anytime soon.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 1%

VI love using the Monorail.  It's a great way to access the East Side of the LV Strip.  As a Local, I hate driving in/out of the Strip....so I avoid it as much as possible.  The Monorail provides a great service.  Here are some tips:\u000a\u000a- If you are a Vegas Local or a Visitor for that matter and are attending an event at the MGM Grand Arena...ie UFC, Boxing, Concerts, whatever....a great shortcut to/from the event is to park at the Las Vegas Hilton or Sahara and take the Monorail to the MGM.  It drops you off at the rear of the MGM and if you take the exit that leads to the shopping mall, you will literally be 2 min away from the Arena.  \u000a\u000aThis only works if you already have your event tickets and can walk in.  The best part?  When you leave, you get on the Monorail and you're back at the Hilton or Sahara within 20 minutes and in your car in no time.  I've done this several times and can be at home in bed within 40 minutes after an event at the Arena....meanwhile, friends who opted to park at the MGM Grand parking garage were still trying to get out because they parked on the 6th Floor....ha!\u000a\u000a- If you are a Vegas Local, you can pick up Monorail tickets for $1 at the Vegas.com booths if they're open.\u000a\u000a- If you plan to ride more than 2 stops, get the day pass....it's worth it.\u000a\u000a- If you're a Local, it's a great way in/out of the Strip on NYE....again, park at the Hilton or Sahara for easy access.....you won't regret it.\u000a\u000a- If you're a Local and work at one of the casinos on the Monorail route....get a bunch of those $1 tickets and have lunch off-property at the other places on the route....it's a fun way to get to see the Strip.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Of course!

VA friend of mine hosted a business dinner here and invited me to join them.  It's been a while since I've visited this joint, so I gladly accepted.  When I arrived, they were already seated and the Appetizers were coming out.  They ordered Coconut Shrimp (Crispy large Shrimp hand-breaded with sweet flaky Coconut & a Citrus-Mustard dipping Sauce) & Creole Baked Goat Cheese (In roasted Red Bell Peppers served with vine-ripened Tomato Salsa and Parmesan Toast).\u000a\u000aThe Coconut Shrimp was OK, not great.  They're large sized Shrimp.....the Coconut Breading was a bit sweet for my tastes.  The Creole Baked Goat Cheese was excellent!  If you try the Goat Cheese, you have to slice up the Bell Pepper and eat it....it was amazingly good.\u000a\u000aFor an entree, I ordered the Jerk Chicken Pasta (Jerk Chicken Breast, fresh Asparagus and Mushrooms tossed in a rich Parmesan-Herb Cream Sauce with Bow-Tie Pasta).  They weren't kidding when they said this dish was "rich".....I think I gained 5 lbs after eating this thing.....it was very good though.  Despite being rich, the Sauce didn't overwhelm the dish and it had a nice flavor.  The Jerk Chicken was cooked perfectly and was of good quality.....you could taste the flavor that Jerk Chicken is known for....I was left wanting more.  Thank God it wasn't bottomless, otherwise I'd have to buy new clothes afterwards....ha!\u000a\u000aOverall, it was good service and good food.  This place is a solid 4 Stars.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 82%

VWhen I moved to Las Vegas in 1993, this mall was the best in town.  Before all of the high end malls on the Strip were built, this was the place to go shopping.....well, all good things get crappy over time.  This place is really Ghetto now.  Was going to do some Christmas shopping, but walked around for 10 minutes and said "screw this" and left.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  No way.

VTime to update this review.  I remember when this mall was the place to come and shop....now, it's one of the worst places to come and shop.  It's been going downhill for years.   During a recent trip, I stopped by to see if it has gotten better...the mall is Ghetto and isn't worth the effort.  I think it's time to close it. \u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 0%

VI'm a member at the Stirling Club and enjoy this facility tremendously.  The workout room, swimming pool & men's locker room/lounge/sauna/spa is upscale and clean.\u000a\u000aThe staff is very helpful and friendly.  There are always fresh towels & robes.  The lockers are huge and the toiletries are top notch.  I enjoy my morning workouts here.\u000a\u000aWill I come back?  Are you kidding me?  Of course....every day.

VLocated inside the Venetian shoppes on the 2nd floor, I saw the menu for this place and immediately made reservations for dinner.  We love Gnocchi and saw that they had several Gnocchi options on the menu.  We were seated in the large patio area and was able to people watch during our meal, which is always a lot of fun.\u000a\u000aAfter browsing the menu, we decided to order:\u000a\u000aQuattro Formaggi Gnocchi, $18.99\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/canaletto-las-vegas?select=cbg_W0iD07P2kHNcJKVVuQ#cbg_W0iD07P2kHNcJKVVuQ\u000a\u000aRisotto w/Truffles & Wild Mushroom, $25\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/canaletto-las-vegas?select=BWH4ejqydJE6CYBS-MRxag#BWH4ejqydJE6CYBS-MRxag\u000a\u000aChocolate Cake & Ice Cream\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/canaletto-las-vegas?select=D3pgjpm-GrEgrjaGAu1xqg#D3pgjpm-GrEgrjaGAu1xqg\u000a\u000aThe Risotto dish we ordered was not on the menu, but the server said they would custom build a dish for us if we had a request.  The Better Half loves Wild Mushrooms and Truffles, so she told the server and the chef put together this dish for her.  I had a few bites and it was awesome!  Sometimes all you have to do is ask.\u000a\u000aI had the Gnocchi and it was also very good.  They were soft and pillowy and a little al dente....there's a trick to cooking Gnocchi well and they have it down pat here.  The Cheesy and Creamy Sauce was perfect.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, we split a Chocolate Cake and Ice Cream....actually, I only had 1 bite.  TBH ate the rest of it....LOL.  It was very rich and sweet....perfect after a nice meal.\u000a\u000aOur server was awesome.....very attentive and willing to go the extra mile to ensure our dining experience was top notch.  I'll definitely be back.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VA friend of mine hosted a dinner here during the G2E convention for his top clients and invited my Wife and I to join them.  When I heard it was at Hamada, I said "We're In!" and didn't even ask The Better Half what she thought about it....ha!\u000a\u000aA group of 16 of us were seated at back to back grills in the Teppan side of the restaurant.  We placed our drink order (glass of Cabernet) with the Mamasan and then enjoyed the company and conversation for what seemed to be a very long time before we were given our menu.  Not sure if it was slow service or if time stood still while we all chatted.\u000a\u000aIf you've never been to Hamada, the Teppan side of the restaurant is identical to Benihana.  A chef grills your order in front of the group of people seated at the table and puts on a show with the food.\u000a\u000aI decided to order the NY Steak & Chicken combo ($35).  The Better Half ordered the Two Lobster Tail dinner ($65).\u000a\u000aThe chef comes out and starts with the grilled Shrimp and Veggies.....then does the whole Volcano thing with the Onion.  Very entertaining, but predictable if you've been to Benihana.  I can't wait for someone to come up with a new act.  Then he gets into our entrees....I thought he did a great job cooking the Chicken and NY Steak.....both were cooked just right and had a lot of flavor.  I love dipping the Meats in the Sauces they provide for you.....although I have no clue what those Sauces are...ha!\u000a\u000aWe continued to eat and drink into the night and they made sure our glasses weren't empty.  A few of us did shots of Japanese Brandy and also had some Dessert, which was a Green Tea Ice Cream.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a fun and delicious dinner with friends and colleagues.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I prefer the other place, but will probably come back sometime in the future.

VWhen Steve Wynn announced that he was going to build this hotel on the former Desert Inn property many years ago, I wondered how he was going to top the Bellagio, which was his signature hotel at that time.  Of course he created one of the most luxurious casino resorts that Vegas has ever seen....featuring:\u000a\u000a- A Ferrari dealership.\u000a\u000a- A luxurious poker room.\u000a\u000a- Spectacular rooms.\u000a\u000a- A 5 Star Golf Course.\u000a\u000a- Awesome restaurants, bars, and nightclubs.\u000a\u000a- High end gambling options.  This place is not for the low limit player.\u000a\u000aWhen my Wife and I want to treat ourselves to a nice evening, we come here.  Will I return?  You can count on it.

VOver the years, I've attended many conferences here.....ASD, MAGIC, CES, and many more I can't count.  The convention center was originally a free standing building next to the old Sands.  When they built the Venetian and Palazzo, they built it around this old building.....the key here is 'old'.\u000a\u000aThat said, to get to the main floor from either resort it's a pretty long walk.  The easiest way to access it is via taxi or limo that drops you off at the steps....but I rarely take taxis in Vegas.\u000a\u000aThere's no free internet access, so you'll either have to pay an arm and a leg or bring your own WiFi.  Good thing I have an iPad with a cellular plan....it's worth the cost....especially since I attend so many conferences.\u000a\u000aRestrooms are old and located on the level below the main floor.  The Las Vegas Convention Center is the same way, but their restrooms are more modern and large.  Oftentimes, this place has a long line waiting to use them because of the volume of people.\u000a\u000aBecause they're trying to drive you to one of the casino properties, there's not much F&B options at the convention center.  The walk is long to get any decent food options.  Also, there's very few places to sit down and take a break from time to time....that's probably my biggest complaint about this place.  When you're on your feet for hours, you need to give show attendees places to rest.\u000a\u000aCompared to meeting space in other cities, this place rocks.  However, compared to places in Vegas...it's just OK.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%.....because I have to.

VWhat was formerly known as the Continental Hotel & Casino, this place was a nice upgrade from that dump.  However, it's not that much better, so don't have high expectations for this place.  If you're looking for a convenient place to gamble in the area or really cheap rooms, then this is you're place.\u000a\u000aI've met a few friends who insisted on getting a room here because of the low room rates....inevitably they'd regret their decision.  Is it worth saving $20-$30 per night?  I don't think so.  Do yourself a favor and pay the extra cash to stay on the Strip.....you'll thank me later.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 10%

VThis private golf course went through a major renovation last year.  Many of the holes were updated with new hazards and the greens were all renovated.  Having played this golf course dozens of times over the years I was excited when a friend of mine invited me to play as I haven't played it since the renovation.\u000a\u000aIt was the 2nd week of December and the weather was perfect!  Temperatures in the low 60's, sunny, and no wind!  Are you kidding me?!  This is truly Golf Nirvana!\u000a\u000aThe newly renovated course plays a lot different than the old course.  The greens are much faster than they were and many of the greens were made smaller with a lot of undulations.....what this means is it's difficult to get the ball to stick on the green and putting is 10x more difficult.\u000a\u000aThe fairways and rough were in excellent condition.\u000a\u000aThe only thing I don't like about this golf course is that there's no beverage cart.  There's a snack shack on 3 and 14 or you can grab a bite/drink at the turn.  It's not too bad in the Winter, but in the Summer you wish there were more opportunities to buy beverages.\u000a\u000aSome other things I love about this course is that they give you complimentary Bottled Water and Apples between the number 1 and 10 tees.  Additionally, this golf course is located in the community where the real life characters that were featured in the movie Casino actually lived.  You can see the house where Robert De Niro's real life character in the movie lived, which is located off the 15th hole, 5th house on the left.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a great golfing experience....I didn't do so well on the course, but like they say "A bad day of Golf is better than a good day without Golf".\u000a\u000aOther notes about this place....\u000a\u000a- You can rent out space for events here.....Weddings, Parties, Corporate Events.  I've hosted and attended several events in the past, they do a great job here.\u000a\u000a- There's a Tennis Club with several courts.  Over the summer they have a kids Tennis camp program.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I can't wait!

VThis place has seen better days.....20+ yrs ago.  It's a really tired casino.  They really need to put some serious money into it, or implode it and start over.  It's too bad because I had some great times in here back in the early 90's.  Now, I wouldn't recommend anyone to stay here.\u000a\u000aWas here recently for a pool tournament.  The major pool leagues have their finals here every year.  It works great for the pool tournaments, but for the tourist/visitor, it's not a good property.  Stay somewhere else and play pool here during those events.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 0%

VThis is my "Go To" spot for exchanging foreign currency.  Whenever I travel abroad I do some research on exchange rates in the country I'm visiting vs this joint.  9 times out of 10 they are very competitive with their rates and I'd rather exchange large sums of currency in Vegas than in a foreign country.\u000a\u000aI was here the other day to convert some US Dollars to Chinese RMB in preparation for an upcoming trip to China.  I called prior to driving down here and asked what the exchange rate was.  They were offering 6.53 RMB to 1 USD.  Luckily, I had a classmate in Beijing that just exchanged some currency the day before and she said the exchange rate at banks in Beijing was 6.45-6.75 RMB to 1 USD.  Not a bad deal!  I'll pay the small vig for the convenience of dealing with someone in my home country where communication is easy.\u000a\u000aOne of the bad things about this place is the parking.  If you're a visitor, you have to park in the underground parking garage.  That's the last place you want to walk to after converting a lot of currency.  \u000a\u000aWhich leads me to my second complaint about this place.....there's no privacy.  There is a large counter in the office where you conduct your transactions and a large window facing the street where people can look inside and see what you're doing. (see pics)  Not a cool situation if you're counting a lot of money on the counter.  I've always felt uncomfortable in that sense.\u000a\u000aOverall Value - they offer great exchange rates, I'm always satisfied with the value they offer.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Unless a better option presents itself, there's no doubt I'll be back!

VOff the Strip and across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel, this hotel is a hidden gem in Vegas.  It's a bit older, but they've done a great job of renovating it and keeping it from falling into disrepair.\u000a\u000aThe rooms are large and some face the interior courtyard where the pool is.  The ground floor rooms facing the pool are the best because you can lounge right outside your bedroom door and enjoy the pool & sun.  The rates are pretty good too.....typically 20-30% less than Strip hotels.  The downside is that there is no casino and other amenities found at the big places......Nightclubs, Ultra Lounges, Pool Parties, etc.\u000a\u000aWhen friends ask me for an alternative to staying on the Strip, this place is at the top of my list.  If you want something different, give this place a try.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VWhat was once known as the Maxim, the Westin Casuarina is a decent mid-level hotel option.  Sheraton pumped some money to remodel the rooms and property a few years back which it badly needed.\u000a\u000aThe hotel feels more like a business hotel than a Vegas casino hotel.  There's a small casino on property and a few restaurants.  The restaurants are not much to write home about.\u000a\u000aWhen a friend of mine stayed in the hotel a couple of weeks ago I stopped by to check out the room.....it's not bad, a solid 3 Stars.  He liked it because it was off-Strip and the price was right....$69 a night.  Of course rates vary, but it was good for that time.\u000a\u000aOverall, not a bad off-Strip option.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

VMet a colleague for lunch here the other day.  It's been a while since I've been to Lawry's and I was excited to see if it was still as good as I remember.  It's near the Howard Hughes business area so there's always a ton of businessmen and women having lunch here on weekdays.  With this in mind, we decided to meet at 11:30 am (opening time) to beat the lunch rush.\u000a\u000aI went up to the chef and ordered a BBQ Beef Sandwich ($12), Cup of Chili ($5), and an Iced Tea ($3).  The BBQ Beef Sandwich was very good.  The Beef was juicy and the BBQ Sauce was slightly tangy and not too sweet....just the way I like it.  The one negative for me was the amount of Sauce, I would have preferred less Sauce.....you can't control the amount of Sauce though, it's served that way.\u000a\u000aThe Chili was amazing!  It is easily the best Chili I've ever had.  It's not for Vegetarians though.....there's Beef in the Chili.  The combination of ingredients was perfect....I wish I knew what was in it!  It also had a slight spicy kick to it too.\u000a\u000aThe atmosphere is upscale and professional, perfect for our lunch meeting.  Overall, it was a great experience.\u000a\u000aHint - If you want to try their amazing Prime Rib but don't want to pay the Dinner prices, come for lunch and get the Lunch Cut Prime Rib, which was $20 I believe.\u000a\u000aDid I get Value for my money?  Yes.\u000aWill I return?  Absolutely.

VThis review is for the Bar/Lounge at the Tuscany.  A friend of mine who was in town for the G2E convention reserved all the rooms for his company at this hotel and decided to have a pre-dinner get together at the Bar/Lounge in the lobby.  This is the 2nd year in a row that he's done this and not much has changed since last year.....the place is not at the top of my list, here's why:\u000a\u000a- The bar/lounge is very smoky.  I understand that we live in Vegas and people can smoke indoors, but damn this place reeks of smoke even when there are no smokers!  When we got down there, we had a party of 16 and not one of us smokes.....no one in the bar was smoking either, but it smelled like there was a peace treaty happening in the middle of the lounge!\u000a\u000a- The service is S-L-O-W.....I waited for over 10 minutes just to place a drink order.....then another 5 minutes for the drink, this was at the bar!  I guess they can't handle 24 people in the bar at one time.  The bar can easily accommodate 3x that many people....oh well.\u000a\u000a- The house Wine sucks.  They didn't have a Wine list and I wasn't in the mood for Beer or Hard Liquor so I asked for a glass of Cabernet.  That was a mistake.....blech, it was pure Swill.  Good thing I wasn't picking up the tab.\u000a\u000aOn the plus side, the seating is comfortable and the large TVs allow you to watch sporting events with ease.  It was Monday Night Football when we were there and the game was just getting started.\u000a\u000aOverall, I enjoyed the company and conversation and was comfortable.....but the drinks and service was a disappointment.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I won't come back unless I'm meeting someone here for an event like this....

VWhat a great golf course!  I had the pleasure of playing with some colleagues and friends recently.  This golf course was strictly a private course when I left Vegas a few years ago.  Since then, they've had to make adjustments during the economic downturn and have more flexible in allowing non-members to play.\u000a\u000aWe had a golf outing with a few people in late September. The weather was so/so....clear skies and nice temperature, but the wind howled during most of the front nine holes, so it was a bit of a challenge.  On the back nine though, weather conditions were perfect and it was much more enjoyable.\u000a\u000aThere are 3 nine hole courses here.  The day we played, the Lakes course was closed for over seeding, so we played the other 2 courses.  They were fun to play for us average golfers, not too challenging and not too easy.\u000a\u000aThe course is kept in immaculate shape.  The fairways and greens are perfect.  The day we played, the greens were a bit slow and difficult to read, but those are adjustments a golfer must make.  The clubhouse is very nice and comfortable.  After our round, we had a few drinks before meeting up for dinner later.\u000a\u000aI love playing here and will definitely come back.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VThe Las Vegas Motor Speedway is an awesome venue to watch Motor Sports.  I've seen NASCAR, NHRA, and Road Course Races here.\u000a\u000aMy favorite events are the NHRA races which happen twice a year at The Strip at the Motor Speedway.  There is always ample seating and the food options are plentiful.  Hot Dogs, Burritos, Pizza, Burgers, Fries, and Funnel Cakes are just a small sample of items you can buy from the vendors.\u000a\u000aAnother great thing is that there really isn't a bad seat at The Strip.  Every seat has a good angle to watch the Top Fuel Dragsters race down the quarter mile at nearly 300 miles per hour.\u000a\u000aYou better bring your earplugs though because you can literally go deaf from the sound of the Top Fuel engines roaring down the track.  And don't forget your sunscreen because you can easily get sunburned too.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet!

VThis review is for the Formula Drift event that was held at the Speedway this weekend.  I normally enjoy the Speedway, but this particular event wasn't that great.\u000a\u000aIt wasn't the event's fault as the drivers and the action was incredible!  However, it was the experience from a spectators perspective.\u000a\u000aFirst of all, the event started at 2 pm in the middle of August!  I realize that the main event didn't start until late in the evening, but come one!  We arrived at 4:30 pm and there wasn't too much shade available besides the vendor tents and even that was brutally hot.\u000a\u000aSecondly, while the bleacher seats gave you a good view of the action, I didn't care for the fences and the limited view you got from the street level.\u000a\u000aThe food options for this event was pitiful too.  Normally, there are great food options for the NHRA events held at the Strip.  But this event had very few food concessions and the ones that were there sucked.  It was so bad we didn't eat.  Also, the prices were outrageous.....$4 for a Bottle of Water and $5 for a Powerade!  No outside food and drink allowed of course.....rip off!\u000a\u000aThe only reason why I gave this event 3 Stars is because the driving was ridiculously awesome.  I have to give these professional drivers a ton of credit.....they are insanely good at what they do.  I want to learn how to drive like that.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Probably, but only at night.

VSolid Del Taco location.  I use their Drive Thru 99% of the time I visit.  They're always fast and accurate with the order, which is all you can ask for when you're picking up a quick meal for hungry kids waiting at the park.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Until my kid moves out of the house, I'm sure I will.

VI use to live around the corner from this place.  This was my 'Go To' gas station/convenience store.  Since I moved away 3 yrs ago, I rarely stop by.  However, I was in the area and needed gas, so I stopped here for a quick fill.  Here are some of the reasons I like this place:\u000a\u000a- The pumps are in good condition and the price of gas was competitive.  It's well lit so it's pretty safe/comfortable for nighttime fillups.  \u000a\u000a- I like how spacious the gas pumps are here......I hate gas stations that are so tight you can't fit a car between the cars filling up.\u000a\u000a- There's a water & compressed air unit here.  It's amazing how many gas stations don't have that anymore.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 30%....would be higher if I lived nearby.

VSolid place to take the family for some Pizza, grub, and fun.  When I lived around the corner from this place we would come here at least once every two months or so.  Since we moved a little further away, we don't frequent this place too often.  However, we were here recently when my Son and his friend wanted to grab some Pizza.\u000a\u000aWe ordered an Extra Large Pepperoni ($18.90).  The kids played in the games area while we waited for the Pizza.  After a short wait, the Pizza was ready.  It was as good as I remembered...yum!  Between the appetites of two 15 yr old boys and this Pizza Lover, we devoured that Pizza Pie in no time.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a good time by all.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 92%

VOk, this is one of my favorite places in my neighborhood.  I live nearby, so it is very convenient.  Not only that, but the food is great too.  Some of my favorite dishes are below........\u000a\u000aBreakfast - Frittatas.....they have several to choose from, they are all great.\u000aLunch/Dinner - the New York Stromboli, Cajun Chicken Wrap, Pizza, and Pasta w/Proscuitto.\u000a\u000aWith the number of big screen TVs in this place it is a great place to come and catch a Football game or playoff Basketball/World Series game while getting something to eat.  They offer personal speakers that you can have at your table so you can pick which game to listen to while dining.

VHad some time to kill, so I stopped in here to grab a bite to eat and watch the Cowboys vs Eagles Sunday night football game.  It has been over 5 yrs since I last visited this place and have heard a lot of good things about it, so I figured it was time.  I'm glad I did!\u000a\u000aThe waiter brought over the menu and as I turned through each page I got more and more excited......2 pages dedicated to Sliders, what?!!  I love Sliders!  Yes, it's true....two whole pages (see pics).  One page has exotic style sliders....ie Alligator, etc.  The other page has some unique ones.....I decided on getting a 6-pack ($15) which allows you to select 2 styles of Sliders.  I chose the Black and Blue (Black Angus w/Cajun Spices, Blue Cheese Crumbles, Caramelized Onions, & Chipotle Mayo)  and the Chicken Cordon Bleu (Grilled Chicken, Honey Baked Ham, Swiss Cheese & Honey Mustard Sauce).  However, I was extremely curious about the Ghost Sliders, which has Ghost Sauce, made from the world's hottest pepper....the Ghost Pepper.  Plus there's an entire 1/2 page on the menu dedicated to items prepared with Ghost Pepper!\u000a\u000aAs most of my friends know, I love spicy food.....but have never tried anything with Ghost Pepper before.  As a reference point, Habanero Peppers are 350,000 on the Scoville Scale, which measures spiceness.  Ghost Pepper registers 1,000,000+ on the Scoville Scale!\u000a\u000aI asked the waiter if I could have a side of the Ghost Sauce so I could try it out.  He said sure.....however, he didn't tell me I'd get charged an extra $1 for that....which kind of irks me.  Keep that in mind if you decide to order a side of it.\u000a\u000aTo wash it down, I had a Hardway IPA ($3)....that's right $3 for a 20 oz glass!\u000a\u000aAfter a few minutes the 6-pack of Sliders came out as well as the Ghost Sauce.  I wanted to try the Ghost Sauce before the food, so I took a toothpick and dipped the tip into the Sauce.....it burned the hell out of my tongue!  That is seriously H-O-T!  It's no joke!  But that's what I enjoy!\u000a\u000aSo....I took a Chicken Cordon Bleu Slider and dipped a little Ghost Sauce on it and took a bite.....yum!  It was great!  Perfect proportion of Ham & Chicken.....they complimented each other well.  The Bun was soft and fresh.....again, perfect.  Next I tried the Black and Bleu Slider.....it was just as good.  Although I could have had it without the Red Onion....I'm not a fan of grilled Red Onions...oh well, next time I get them without it.\u000a\u000aI'm glad I ordered the IPA because I needed it to put the 5 alarm fire out in my mouth.  I also ordered a glass of Blueberry Vanilla Wheat ($2) after I was done with the IPA....it was also very good and cheap!  Can't get over how cheap the Beer was!\u000a\u000aOverall, it was an awesome experience.  Good food, good Beer, and I lost my Ghost Pepper virginity!\u000a\u000aOther things worth mentioning.....there's a 7 lb Burger challenge, yes 7 LBS!  If you can eat it in less than 12 min and change, then you get it named after you.  Believe it or not, it's been done before.  No way I could do that!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  As the Macho Man Randy Savage would say......Oh Hell Ya!

VI've been coming here ever since the place opened in the mid 90's.  I use to live a few blocks away.  Since I moved a couple of years ago, I've only been here once or twice a year.  Since I was in the area, I decided to stop by for lunch today.\u000a\u000aI ordered the #1 Sandwich (Ham, Salami, Capicolla, Pepperoni & Provolone Cheese) and a bag of Jalapeno Chips.  The Sandwich was made fresh and tasted delicious!\u000a\u000aSolid experience, just like I remember.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  When I'm in the area, sure!

VCanyon Gate is one of my favorite golf courses to play in Vegas.  Tucked away in the private community of Canyon Gate here's why I love this course:\u000a\u000a- It's never crowded.  It's a private club, which means they don't pack in a ton of tee times.  There's nothing more frustrating than a crowded golf course.\u000a\u000a- The golf course is always in immaculate condition.  Kudos to the greenskeepers, they do a wonderful job of ensuring the course is in perfect shape.\u000a\u000a- Fast, challenging greens.....actually, really fast greens!  In addition to being fast, they all have a lot of undulations and tiers, which makes putts over 4 ft very challenging!\u000a\u000a- The 18th hole.  Easily my favorite hole on the course.  The slight dogleg right with a green that's wedged between a water hazard on the front and rocks & the clubhouse on the back, there's not a lot of room for error.  There are many times where I splashed it into the drink or overshot it OB nearly breaking a window or three...ha!  It's a lot of fun and keeps you hungry to come back.....great way to end a round!\u000a\u000a- Awesome staff.  They're always friendly and accommodating.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's one of best golf experiences in town.  Return Factor - 100%

VMy family has been going to this church since it was a temporary building in the early 90's.  We've grown together with the parish and we plan to continue to be a part of this community as long as we live in Las Vegas.\u000a\u000aEven though we moved to a different parish's region, we still attend St. Joseph's.  The church is large and comfortable and the priests & staff are friendly.

VI enjoy shopping at Home Depot when I'm in need of home improvement or home project items.  Today I stopped by this Home Depot, which is usually not too crowded and has Self Service registers.  I knew exactly what I needed, where to go, and was in/out of this store within 7 minutes.....now that's awesome!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Absolutely!

VOddly enough, this was my first time eating at a Rubio's.  I was in the area and decided to give it a try.  After browsing the menu for a while, I decided to go for the Steak Burrito w/Pinto Beans instead of Black Beans ($6.29) and a Carnitas Taco ($1.69).\u000a\u000aWhile I was waiting for my meal, I went to the Salsa Bar and filled up 4 cups of their spiciest Salsa.  The food came out relatively fast.  I decided to go for the Carnitas Taco first......it kind of like the "Street Tacos" found in Mexico.....Corn Tortilla, Meat, Onions, Cilantro, Lime Juice.  I poured some Salsa on it and took a bite.....it was pretty good, but not great.  It's very small and in my opinion not worth $1.69.\u000a\u000aNext, I went for the Steak Burrito which came with a side of Chips.....bonus!  I took one bite of the Burrito and became a fan.  The Steak reminds me of the Carne Asada I had in So Cal growing up.  The flavor of the Burrito hit home for me.  The Salsa was pretty spicy too, so that was awesome!  The Chips weren't that good though.....good thing I didn't pay extra for that.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a good dining experience.  Glad I found a new quick Mexican joint.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VWas in the area and stopped by at 10:30 am for an early lunch the other day.  I had the #13 Original Italian Sub (Provolone, Ham, Prosciuttini, Cappacuolo, Salami and Pepperoni) $6.95 done Mike's Way (Onions, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Vinegar, Oil and Spices).  I had a bag of Jalapeno Chips and a Bottle of Water to wash it down.\u000a\u000aSince i was probably one of the 1st orders of the day, it was really fresh....especially the Bread.  It was easily the best Sub Sandwich I've had at Jersey Mike's, ever.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Yep, sure will.

VI shop at this Ross when I need to find a quick gift for someone.  It seems to have a nicer selection in their housewares section than most of their stores in Vegas.....so, when I'm in a pinch and need a gift, I stop here.\u000a\u000aThe store is relatively clean compared to some of the other ones in town.  It does get very busy though and the lines can be atrocious.  Not much else to say about the store....it's a Ross.\u000a\u000aWill I come back?  Chances are good.

VWe finally broke down and bought the Son a cell phone....we resisted for many years, but he's a good kid and deserves it.  So, we went to the nearest Verizon Wireless Store for him to pick one.\u000a\u000aWhen you walk in, you have to check in with a Verizon employee, otherwise you won't get served.\u000a\u000aWe browsed around for a while and he picked his phone.  I noticed there was a self service payment machine, which is convenient (see pics).  The person who assisted us was very friendly and we were in/out of there within 20 minutes of walking in.....what a miracle!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Next time I need a phone, probably.

VWent there for lunch today.  Almost went to Joe's Pizza next door, but opted for a sandwich instead.  I've been eating Capriottis sandwiches for years, but this is the first time in this particular restaurant.\u000a\u000aThe place was busy and the people working there were friendly.  Nice clean tables and floors.\u000a\u000aI ordered a small Italian Sandwich with everything on it.  Got a bag of Jalapeno Dirty Chips & a bottle of water.  The sandwich turned out nice and fresh, but I don't know.....Capriottis has lost a lot of it's luster with me.  I just don't enjoy their sandwiches like I use to.  I don't know what it is.  \u000a\u000aWill I return?  Probably, but not on the top of my list.

VWas here last night to meet up with some friends for Monday Night Football and to have a couple of Beers before dinner.  We settled in around the bar and browsed the Beer menu.  There was so many to choose from and I was indecisive, so the waitress said she'd bring me a few samples so I could make up my mind....bonus.  \u000a\u000aAfter tasting a few brews, I went for the Fullers ESB.  It's a very good tasting English Ale that was very fulfilling.\u000a\u000aAlthough I've been here many times in the past, I learned something new.....you can't order hard liquor at the bar!  A friend of ours tried to order a Crown and Coke and they said that you had to be in the dining area and had to order food with a hard liquor order.  The reason is that their liquor license is for a Tavern, which means only Beer & Wine at the bar.....hard liquor in the dining room.  That sucked for the people in our group that didn't drink Beer or Wine.  I guess I never knew since I've only ordered Beer when I come here.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a good time for everyone.  Will definitely be back again.

VI was jonesing a sandwich today for lunch, so I tried to go to a near Swenson and Twain, but it was closed.  So I opted for a known commodity, Jason's Deli.\u000a\u000aI ordered the New York Yankee, which is my favorite sandwich they have.  The place was moderately busy for the noon rush hour, but my food came out relatively quickly.\u000a\u000aWill I come back?  Of course, it's one of my favorite places.

VOh Geri's....it's been way too long.  When I use to work on the Strip we would come here for lunch every other month or so.  Since I no longer work or live nearby, I haven't been here in a couple of years.  An old colleague of mine wanted to meet up for lunch and when he suggested Geri's I couldn't say no.\u000a\u000aSince it has been a while, I wanted to make this visit count....so I ordered:\u000a\u000aPhilly Cheesesteak Sandwich w/Cheese Whiz - $7.50\u000aPierogies - $3\u000aStuffed Jalapenos - $3.95\u000aSweet Potato Fries - $2.50\u000a\u000aI know, it sounds like a lot of food, but besides the Sandwich the portions are small. (see pics)  Plus, I was sharing with my friend.\u000a\u000aThey deliver the food as it becomes ready here.  First up to bat was the Jalapeno Poppers.  Stuffed with Cream Cheese, the Poppers were awesome....cooked just right so they weren't dripping with grease and the Cheese wasn't going to burn the hell out of my taste buds.\u000a\u000aNext up was the Sweet Potato Fries & Pierogies.  Again, cooked just right....not greasy at all.  I wonder how they do that?!  The Pierogies were very good....chewy, doughy shell with Potato filling....yum!  Sweet Potato Fries were great too....but I saved those to eat with the Steak Sandwich.\u000a\u000aLast up was the Steak Sandwich....one bite and I was back in Cheesesteak bliss....dammit Geri's, I've missed you!  I instantly remember why I love this place.  My buddy who was having lunch with me is from South Philly and he brings his parents here every time they visit from Philly (5-6 x per year)....it's a family tradition now, that's how good it is!\u000a\u000aNeedless to say, we didn't leave any food in our baskets.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I'm not waiting 2 yrs for the next visit, for sure!

VStopped here to pick up a few things for the house.  I was on this side of town to visit a friend at St Rose Hospital and decided to stop by here before jumping on the 215.  Conveniently located just off the Eastern exit off the 215 it is an easy in/out.\u000a\u000aThe only frustrating thing is that it took the cashier a long time to check people out....and that was in the 20 Items or Less lane!  But it is Walmart, so what do I expect?\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Not anytime soon....but that's because it's in BFE!

VWas doing some Christmas Shopping with my Son and decided to stop by this joint based on the great reviews we saw on Yelp.  I've passed this place at least 100x and have never stopped to give it a try.  I'm glad I did.\u000a\u000aBetween the two of us, we ordered Wings w/Med Sauce ($10), Sliders w/Fries ($10), and Momma's BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger w/half Fries & half Onion Rings($10).  Our server Joanna, who was very nice, helped us select these items.  First up was the Wings.  They were pretty good.  Joanna recommended getting the Med Sauce for the flavor but having the Hot Sauce on the side for the heat.....it worked!  It was very good.\u000a\u000aMy Son had the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and it was huge!  He said he enjoyed it.  I tried some of his Onion Rings....they were thick, crunchy, Beer-battered, and soooo good!  The Onions had a nice sweet flavor to them that went well with the Beer-batter crust....pure awesome!\u000a\u000aMy Sliders were pretty good....I wouldn't say they were great, but good.  They were slightly overcooked....well done.  I think the cook took them off the grill Med-Well and then it got Well-Done between the kitchen and the table.  They had good flavor though and the Bread was really good...the best part of the dish.\u000a\u000aOverall, we had a great lunch and Joanna was especially helpful.  She has a great personality and made us feel welcome and special.\u000a\u000aWill we return?  We spotted a few other items on the menu we want to try, so next time we're in the area, we plan to come back.

VOver the years I have past this place 1000's of times.  I finally had the opportunity to eat there yesterday and it was a big disappointment.\u000a\u000aWe arrived a little early and decided to have a Beer and much on some Chips & Salsa while waiting for a friend to arrive.  We also ordered a side of Guacamole to go with it.  The Chips & Salsa were ok and the Guacamole was ok.  The Chips didn't taste fresh and there was a bunch of mashed up small pieces at the bottom of the basket, which normally means we got an older batch and had the last basket before they prepared fresh chips.....Strike 1.\u000a\u000aWhen my friend finally arrived, it took forever for the server to come by and take our order.  At first we didn't realize how long it was because we had a couple of Beers to hold us over, but after a while we began to notice that it was taking a long time.  I had to flag her down after waiting for 15 minutes.....Strike 2.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Beef Fajitas & 1 of their Jalapeno & Cheese Tamales.  They are known for their Tamales, so I was excited to have an opportunity to try one.  The food came out pretty fast, but they didn't bring my Tamale and they didn't bring a friend's entree.  We waited for the food....they brought out my friend's entree, but forgot my Tamale.  I was too busy eating my Fajitas and didn't notice until I was 1/2 way through my food....I mentioned it to the waitress and she said she'd be right back with it.  Meanwhile, the Beef Fajitas were ok.....the flavor wasn't as robust as I would like them to be.....and the meat wasn't up to par.  It wasn't good quality steak in my opinion.\u000a\u000aEveryone finished their food and the conversation was so good that I forgot about my Tamale until my friend brought it to my attention.....damn, by that point I didn't even want it.  So I mentioned it to the waitress.....she apologized, but it didn't seem sincere.\u000a\u000aWe had a couple more Beers after lunch and when they brought the check, I saw the freakin' Tamale on the bill!  What the hell?!  Strike 3!\u000a\u000aAt that point, I didn't care anymore and since the Tamale was only $3 I paid the damn bill and we left.\u000a\u000aOverall, I was disappointed with the service and the food quality.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Not a chance.

VI'm a fan of Sam's Club and this was the first time I've been to this one.  I stopped in to pick up some vitamins and supplements.\u000a\u000aIt is a very clean location and a customer with 1000 items was kind enough to let me go ahead of her since I only had 4 items I was carrying in my hands.....you don't see kindness like that too often anymore.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Only if I'm in the neighborhood, which is rarely.

VAfter shopping at the 99 Cent Store in the same shopping center, we decided to stop in here to look around and see if we could find anything worthwhile.  I was surprised when The Better Half called me over to the display case at the front of the store to show me a large marble carving....it was awesome and matched a set of lamps in our living room!  \u000a\u000aNormally, we don't find items like this in a thrift store, but it was our lucky day I guess.  The price for it?  $10!  We gladly paid for it and of course, I had to carry this thing out to the car.  It was 30 lbs or so, but it was worth the effort.\u000a\u000aI'm glad we stopped by the 99 Cent Store that day otherwise we wouldn't have found this gem.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VLocated on Eastern Ave just off the 215, this is one of our favorite spots to fill up for gas on the drive back to Phoenix.  The lanes are wide and there's a convenience store to grab snacks/drinks.  Gas prices are pretty good.  There are also many choices for food around the area too, so we usually fill up with gas then grab a bite nearby.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

VA close friend of mine was in the ICU for a stroke.  He was in the hospital for 12 days and in the ICU for 10 of those days.  I went to visit him last week.  \u000a\u000aAlthough he didn't make it, the hospital staff was very professional and fought very hard to keep him alive.  It is one of the best hospitals in the Las Vegas Valley.  His family was very pleased with the care that he received during his stay here.\u000a\u000aHe will be remembered by friends and family.....at least we are assured that he was well taken care of during his final days.\u000a\u000aI hope I never return to this place.....but that's not because of their service levels....it's because I don't like being in a hospital.

Most recently I stopped here to browse their selection while Christmas shopping.  I found Santa Hats for $6.95, so I bought one for my Son and I....then bought a pink one for The Better Half.\u000a\u000aAs a bonus, the staff here is always friendly and helpful.\u000a\u000aWill I return?

VI stopped here to pick up some Candy for The Better Half (TBH).  She loves the Dove Dark Chocolate Candy and was having a bad day at work.....so to avoid bringing the bad Karma home, I surprised her with the Candy.\u000a\u000aNormally, I go to Walgreens, but it wasn't in the area and this CVS was on my way home.  It was a quick in/out and the cashier scanned in her CVS Card so I could get the discount.  Does anyone ever use their card or does the cashier always use theirs?  I never bring my card.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a typical CVS Pharmacy experience.  Clean store, friendly employees.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet.

VWe've been coming to the Cracked Egg for over two years now.  When my Son was in Middle School, we'd have a weekly Father/Son Breakfast on Monday mornings....eat great food, read the WSJ, and talk about whatever.  Since he had today off of school, we decided to go this morning.  \u000a\u000aWe walked in and noticed a sign that said "Ask About Our Gluten Free Menu"....FYI for those of you that look for that menu.  The restaurant is casual and has indoor and outdoor seating.  There's counter seating too, if you're dining alone and feel more comfortable at a counter.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger Skillet (Ground Beef, Cheddar Cheese, Bacon, Seasoned Potatoes, 2 Eggs) $9.25 w/Sourdough Toast.  Kiddo ordered a Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs w/Sourdough Toast.....and Mom ordered the Turkey Sausage, Eggs, and Coffee Cake.....The Better Half (TBH) was the smart one and passed on Breakfast to go to her Pilates & Yoga classes while we consumed enough calories to start a Forest Fire.\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait our food was ready and brought out to the table.....it was just as I remembered.....big portions, and cooked just right. (see pics)  I had my Eggs over medium....they laid gently over the Bacon Cheeseburger and Seasoned Potatoes....I dove right in.  I'm a big fan of having the right proportion of food and they get it right here.....there's enough of each ingredient to be able to taste each flavor without overwhelming the taste buds with a single item.  The Eggs were made perfectly with the Yolk still runny but the whites cooked all the way through.  I added some Gringo Bandito Hot Sauce and devoured the entire dish!\u000a\u000aMom and Kiddo enjoyed their meal too....but needed a doggy bag to bring some of it home.  I wish I had their appetite....glad I hit the gym early this morning.\u000a\u000aAs usual, the service is great....friendly servers, kept our cup of Joe and glasses of Water full.  Another bonus is that they have a dining rewards club where you earn points for eating there and they send you offers in the mail for discounts off meals....we were redeeming a $8.00 coupon today....score!\u000a\u000aThis is hands down my favorite Breakfast spot in Vegas.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You can count on it!

VTook my Mom to breakfast on NYE morning.  It was 10:30 am and the place was packed!  We placed our name on the wait list and were seated after a short 10 minute wait.\u000a\u000aI was torn between the Short Stack Multi-grain Pancakes or the Raspberry Cream Cheese filled French Toast.  I decided on the Raspberry French Toast ($9.25).  Mom ordered a Hamburger ($7.35).\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait our food was ready.  I forgot how large the portions are....my Raspberry French Toast was enough to feed 2 people!  That's coming from a guy who can eat a lot! (see pics)\u000a\u000aThe French Toast was dusted with Powdered Sugar and had fresh Raspberries on top in addition to the Raspberry flavored Cream Cheese in the middle (see pics).  I put a little Syrup on the first bite.....yum!  It tasted sooo good!  As a matter of fact, I didn't need the Syrup because it tasted just fine without it.  I didn't use much Syrup for the rest of the dish.  There was so much food I couldn't finish my plate.\u000a\u000aMom enjoyed her Hamburger but thought her Seasoned Fries were too Salty.  I tried a few....they tasted good to me, but I could see how she felt they were too Salty.  I don't mind a lot of Salt.\u000a\u000aOverall it was another great meal @ the Cracked Egg.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet!

VMom and I stopped in to my favorite breakfast joint on the way to the airport.  I decided to try something I haven't tried before, so I went with the Peanut Butter & Cream Cheese stuffed French Toast w/Bananas.\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait, our oder came out.....their portions are enough to feed two people!  I wish they offered a 1/2 order.  Oh well, I did my best to finish this thing, but it proved to be too much for me.  The combination of Peanut Butter and Cream Cheese was awesome!  It was so good I didn't need any Syrup or Butter added to it.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/74pWjFssgqyhaVg-YCUo3A?select=sJ_90yVfA6dYgPpZs5qXQg\u000a\u000aAnother great breakfast experience!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VYelp has this location as 'Closed'....it's not.  I was there today and had a 12" BMT Sandwich on Italian Herbs & Cheese Bread ($6.00).  The Sandwich was made fresh and tasted very good.  I'm a big fan of Subway and enjoy coming to this location.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet I will.

VStopped by here for an early dinner the other day.  I live around the corner and have never tried it.  Since Eddie D's is two doors down, I always get distracted.  However, this particular day I wanted Mexican Food and was determined to try it out.\u000a\u000aI ordered a Carne Asada Burrito ($4.75) and an Al Pastor Taco ($2.40).  The restaurant is casual and has 15 or so tables, plenty of seating.  There's a small Salsa Bar (see pics) and a soda fountain.\u000a\u000aThe food came out after a short wait.   The Burrito was smoking hot....I could barely hold on to it, so I waited a few minutes while it cooled off a bit.  After cooling down a bit, I dove right in.  I was disappointed to discover that it's exactly like Roberto's Taco Shop.....damn.  The Carne Asada Burrito was just ok.....I think a bunch of Roberto's former employees must have went around town opening Taco Shops.  I don't think you would be able to distinguish between the two.\u000a\u000aThe Al Pastor Taco was a disappointment too.  It lacked the flavor that I expect from Al Pastor.....the smoky, marinated flavor.  It was bland.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was disappointing, but filling and OK.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Probably not.

VHaving a 14 year old Son means a lot of trips to Fast Food joints and this one is in our neighborhood.  This one is not one of our favorite joints.  The food quality here is sub-par....even by fast food standards.  The Beef never tastes fresh and the Bread seems a little old at times.\u000a\u000aWe decided we wouldn't eat here anymore because it's that bad.  There are 1000's of other fast food joints to choose from.

VOnce upon a time I use to come to this place to meet friends for late night drinks and to hang out.  That was a long time ago, when it first opened.  Now, I only stop by when I take one of the cars in for servicing next door at Ted Wien auto service, which was the case during my most recent visit.\u000a\u000aIt's a nice place to hang out and have a few drinks while you kill time.  There are video poker machines on the bar, but since I don't gamble I hung out at one of the tables near the bar and surfed the web on my iPad.\u000a\u000aThe bartenders were very friendly and bored.....they'd talk to a rock if they could, so you should have some nice company too.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a pretty cool neighborhood bar.  They serve food, but I wasn't hungry the day I was there, so no food this trip.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VConveniently located on the corner of Buffalo and Cheyenne, I like to stop by this gas station when I fill up my car at night.  The lighting is very good and the pump area is wide open so that you can see very easily.  Safety is important to me and this one is the most safe for late night fill ups.\u000a\u000aThere are other amenities here as well.....convenience store, small car wash, video poker machines.  The brand of gas is Chevron and it is competitively priced close to the lowest price in the neighborhood.  I will return when I'm out and about and need a late night fill.

VMy neighborhood Walgreens & "go to" pharmacy.  What can I say about this place?.....it's convenient, clean, and the staff is friendly.  We get most of our daily living stuff here.....Son's contact lens cleaner, eye drops, etc....and when we get sick we stop here to get cold medicine  and cough drops.\u000a\u000aWe used this location to get Passport photos for our trip to China and it's a quick process.  Their photo equipment is always in good shape, so if you need prints printed from your digital or old school camera, they can accommodate.\u000a\u000aI've never had a problem here.  It's a Walgreens and not much different than the 1000's of others around the country.  I'm glad that they're consistently good in my book.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You can count on it.

VDona Maria is in my neighborhood, so we eat here every once in a while (3-4 times per year).  They're known for their Tamales here.  If I was to rate this place just on the Tamales, I'd give them 4 Stars.  However, since they aren't, they only get 3 Stars.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a- Their Chips & Salsa is not that great.  The Chips are inconsistent....sometimes they're fresh and taste good, sometimes they're greasy and taste stale.  The Salsa is very weak and bland in my opinion.....no option for Spicy Salsa either.\u000a\u000a- Nachos and Beef Fajitas are my entrees of choice here.  Both are just OK, not great.  It fills my tummy, but it doesn't leave me wanting more.\u000a\u000aThe family enjoys coming here because it's close to home.  If it were up to me, I'd pass on it most days.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VStopped by for Lunch the other day.  This particular location has a handful of tables and chairs inside.  When I went, there were only a few people in the joint.\u000a\u000aI ordered a Small (9") Italian Sub (Genoa Salami, Capacola, Prosciutini) w/Hot Peppers, Provolone, Mustard, Mayo, Pickles, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions.  Also had a bag of Jalapeno Chips and Bottled Water to go with the Sandwich.\u000a\u000aThe food came out a few minutes later and I dove right in.  As usual, it was a sloppy meal with stuff falling out of the Sandwich.  The ingredients were fresh and tasty.  For some reason, even though it's a Small Sandwich, it's always very filling.\u000a\u000aOver the years Capriotti's has declined somewhat.  It use to blow me away, now that it's been franchised I think their ingredients have lost some quality....can't support that with fact, only my opinion after eating at various Capriotti's for over 17 yrs.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Probably, but won't crave it like I use to.

VI only eat at El Pollo Loco during Lent, when I give up Meat.  I love their BRC (Beans, Rice, Cheese) Burritos....and the price is right, $1.  \u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/A4yJu-Nq1n6nuLP6QKZkrw?select=EdwwFuJK_tM_Y6643VKYRQ\u000aIn addition to the BRC Burrito, I tried a Quesadilla for the 1st time.....pass on it, trust me.  The BRC Burrito was good, as usual....however, I think they're getting smaller and smaller.\u000a\u000aTheir complimentary Salsa Bar is pretty good, although they don't have a really Spicy option for us who love the Heat.\u000a\u000aOverall, this past visit went OK.  The cashier was really slow at taking the orders and it took forever just to place one with only 2 people ahead of me.  The food was good and made up for the minor inconvenience.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 65%

VI live nearby and have literally passed by this place 1000's of times.  Today was the day to take it off the "To Do List".  I dropped in around 11:30 am, just before the Lunch rush.  It is located in an outdoor food court in a business mall and has a handful of tables inside with community tables outside on the patio.  It's casual fast food dining, so don't worry about dressing up.\u000a\u000aAfter browsing the menu, I decided to order the Gyro Time ($6.95) and the Falafel Pocket ($5.95) with a bottle of Water....total damage with tax $15.53, ouch!  This was without any sides.\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait my order was brought out by the cashier.  A small side of Hummus and Tzatziki Sauce.  I dove into the Gyro first.  It was full of Gyro Meat & Onions.  The Pita was nice and moist but the Meat was bland to me.  Despite putting the Tzatziki Sauce on it, it was still lacking flavor.  I was hungry, so I finished it.  Next up was the Falafel Pocket.  It was stuffed with Falafel, Tomatoes, Onions, and Cucumber.  I used the Hummus and remaining Tzatziki Sauce with the Falafel Pocket.  I liked it better than the Gyro.  The Falafel had a nice flavor to it and it went well with the toppings.\u000a\u000aOverall, I was underwhelmed by the experience and flavors of their food.  For the price I paid for the food, I expected much more.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Nope.

VAfter a disastrous visit to One Stop Mailboxes and More, I came here to get my Printing & Shipping done.\u000a\u000aAll I needed was to:\u000a\u000a1 - Print a few documents.\u000a2 - Package up some product.\u000a3 - Ship the package via my UPS account.\u000a\u000aIt was a bit of a process, but after a few minutes of working with the employee I was able to get the services that I was looking for done.  She too had issues printing from my Flash Drive....when did it become such a huge problem to print from a Flash Drive?\u000a\u000aOverall, it was an ok experience.  I'm sure it will go 10x better the next time I need to get it done.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Yes.

VCame here with my Son to look for a replacement charging cable for his iPod Touch.  It's been a while since I've been here and there were a lot of changes!\u000a\u000aThey renovated the entire store.....it's much cleaner and well organized with sampling stations everywhere so that you can mess around with some of the electronics.  They have a huge "Magnolia" room which is their premium brand area.  I wasn't here to buy a big ticket item, but browsed anyway.  I saw the new MacBook Air, damn it's really thin!  (see pics)\u000a\u000aMy Son found what he was looking for.....a cable and a wall charger, for $20, not bad!  At the Apple Store that would have cost $59.99 I'm sure.\u000a\u000aOverall, great shopping experience.  I like the new look.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet.

VYes, another review for Del Taco.....when I'm on my No Meat diet, this place is on my frequently visited list.  This visit, I got a Veggie Works Burrito, and a Bean Burrito Deluxe.\u000a\u000aThe service was fast and the food was prepared well.  Sometimes they skimp on the ingredients, but this trip they did a great job and the Burritos were tasty.  Overall, not bad.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VOver the years, I've played this golf course at least 20 times.  Maybe more, but who's counting?  I enjoy this track, here's why:\u000a\u000a- It's kept in good shape.  Besides a few issues with the greens a couple of years ago, they've done a good job maintaining this golf course.\u000a\u000a- It's reasonably priced.  You can find some great deals here.  Especially over the summer where you can get rates around $40.  If you're in the casino industry they'll usually have a casino rate....bonus.\u000a\u000a- Food is pretty good.  During the nice weather months, they'll have a BBQ going near the clubhouse, so you can pickup a Burger or Grilled Chicken at the turn or on the 19th Hole.  It's good stuff too.\u000a\u000a- Drink cart girls do their job well.  What I mean by this is that they make frequent rounds.  There's nothing worse than seeing the drink cart only once per 9 holes....you should see them at least 3 times per 9 holes.  They do that here for the most part.\u000a\u000a- Fun golf course.  This track is really fun.  Each hole is designed well so that it can be fun and challenging for most skill levels.  It might be a bit too easy for lower handicap golfers as there aren't too many long holes here...and the greens are not blazing fast.  But for the average golfer like me, it's fun.\u000a\u000a- Nice views.  There are some great views of the mountains and Vegas Valley.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's one of my favorite regular golf courses.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I can't wait!

VI'm not going to pretend that I'm one of those guys who can fix cars....because I can't.\u000a\u000a- I can replace a flat tire with a spare.\u000a\u000a- I can jump start my car, assuming there's another car to get a jump from.\u000a\u000a- I can't tow my own car.\u000a\u000a- I can't fix a blown radiator.\u000a\u000a- I don't carry 2 spares for 2 flat tires.\u000a\u000a- I can't replace a busted timing belt.\u000a\u000a- Beyond a dead battery, I can't determine what's wrong with my car if it won't start.\u000a\u000aThe list of Can'ts are just some of the reasons why I have AAA and have used them to bail me out of those situations over the years.  90% of the time they're responsive and show up within 30 minutes.\u000a\u000aWill I use them again?  I hope not, but I feel more secure as a member.

VI'm a fan of RC Willey.  We've purchased 3 mattresses, 2 TV stands, a dishwasher, washer & dryer set, and a TV at this location.  Here are some tips:\u000a\u000a- Negotiate.  The prices listed are not final.  Do some competitive shopping ahead of time so you can tell them XYZ store has a better price on a comparable item....it will give you leverage.\u000a\u000a- Ask for FREE delivery, if you're spending over $1,000.\u000a\u000a- Keep an eye out for sales and specials where they give you something for FREE.  When we bought our TV, they gave us a holiday dish set.  We didn't need it, but it was a great gift for someone.  We've also got gift cards in the past as well.\u000a\u000a- If you don't want to be bugged by a sales person, tell them up front that you're there to browse.  They'll leave you alone.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a great place to shop for furniture.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

It was lunch time and I thought it would take a while to make the Sammie....but it didn't take them long.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, the Sammie didn't taste all that good.  I don't know, it was kind of bland and was light on the toppings.  It's strange because I usually enjoy a Port of Subs Sandwich.  Maybe I caught them on an off day.\u000a\u000aOverall, I wasn't satisfied with my meal.  Return Factor - 30%

VWhat was once known as the Boomtown Hotel & Casino, this joint has come a long way.  The food is very good here and the value is great.  My friends and I enjoy coming here for a mid-week lunch buffet.  The selection of food is very good and we like how they serve the food in smaller portions on the buffet line so that it stays hot and fresh.\u000a\u000aWe also like to come here to browse the MASSIVE Bass Pro Shops store here.  Everything from Golf Clubs to bow & arrows to guns can be found here.  There's even an indoor shooting range for you to try out the weapons before you buy.....very cool!\u000a\u000aThe casino is not too large and has a good mix of games.  I no longer gamble, but my friends who do and live nearby enjoy coming here to play and get their monthly gift from the player's club.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a fun Locals casino....I only wish it was closer to home.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 85%

VNot one of my favorite golf courses.....it's a "target golf" course, which means that it's not very forgiving if you're not accurate.  Tucked away in Summerlin between the Suncoast & Rampart Casinos, this course is 10x better than Angel Park as far as quality of the course.  There are three 9 hole courses that you combine to create your 18 hole round.  Here's the breakdown for each 9 hole course:\u000a\u000aDesperado\u000aChampionship - 3,349 yds\u000aBack - 3,095 yds\u000aMiddle - 2,859 yds\u000aLadies - 2,371 yds\u000a\u000aDiablo\u000aChampionship - 3,586 yds\u000aBack - 3,342 yds\u000aMiddle - 3,092 yds\u000aLadies - 2,690 yds\u000a\u000aOutlaw\u000aChampionship - 3,256 yds\u000aBack - 3,066 yds\u000aMiddle - 2,817 yds\u000aLadies - 2,494 yds\u000a\u000aMy last visit we played Diablo & Outlaw.  I didn't do so well....lost a ton of balls and was frustrated most of the day.  Pretty much par for the course...ha!  The greens and course were in great shape, but these courses that play long and tight just aren't for me.\u000a\u000aYou better bring your A-Game when you come to this course.  I wouldn't recommend it for beginners or high handicapped players.....it will frustrate you and there are better options in Vegas that will be more enjoyable.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I probably will, to see if I can conquer this course....long shot, I know.

VTime for a review update.  I recently played this golf course and it's still one of the toughest golf courses I've ever played.  There is no room for error here.  If you're not hitting them straight, then you're in for a long day.\u000a\u000aWe played Desperado & Outlaw.  Both courses were in great shape.  The recent rains and floods in Vegas did not impact these courses.  The fairways and greens were very well kept.\u000a\u000aI wasn't hitting them particularly straight, so I struggled.  It also didn't help that Desperado was cart path only....that meant a lot of walking for 9 holes.  The weather was awesome and the drink cart girls kept us hydrated, so we were very happy despite not playing very well.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 65%

VI've heard about this place from many people on Yelp Talk, so I decided to give it a try.  I stopped by for lunch yesterday and ordered 2 Slices of Cheese and 1 Slice of Pepperoni.  I wanted to try their Sicilian Pizza, but they didn't serve slices and I wasn't about to chow down that much Pizza....not that day anyway.\u000a\u000aThe Pizza is a NY Style Thin Crust.  It's served piping hot.  I went for the Cheese Slices first.  I thought that the Cheese to Sauce ratio was good.  The Crust was a little bland, but it wasn't soggy, which is a big plus.  Overall, I enjoyed the Cheese Slices.\u000a\u000aNext I went after the Pepperoni Slice.  I prefer to have my Pepperoni well done burnt a little on the edges, but I didn't hold that against them.  The Pepperoni has a nice zing to it and the Pizza slice had an appropriate amount of Pepperoni....I don't like it when too much Pepperoni is put on a Pizza, it can ruin the flavor.\u000a\u000aOverall, I thought the Pizza here was very good.  I'm not sure how it will hold up on delivery though as most NY Style Thin Crust Pizza that I've ordered delivered shows up soggy.  The people who work here are very friendly too, which is another plus in my book.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Of course!

VOnce upon a time I thought this place was pretty cool.  Now, it's just A-OK.\u000a\u000aThe casino is very smokey and the employees are not really friendly here.  We use to enjoy coming here for a glass of Wine or three at the lounges....however, the entertainment here is sub-par and the people watching factor sucks....plus, the house Wine, which use to be pretty good, tastes like swill now.\u000a\u000aI only give this place 3 Stars because the food is ok in the restaurants.  However, you can find a better gamble and other entertainment options next door at the Suncoast.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I'm sure I will....but not willingly.

VThis place has lost it's energy and excitement.  When I lived in Vegas, we used to come here to go to JC Wooloughan's Irish Pub....and the place was usually packed and fun.  On a recent trip, we stayed next door at the Suncoast and decided to drop in for old time's sake.\u000a\u000aWhen we walked through the casino, we were disappointed.  There were only a few customers at the machines and tables and it was not exciting at all.  We hoped to find some energy at the Irish Pub....nope, not there either.\u000a\u000aWe stayed and had a few drinks to see if it picked up a bit.  We enjoyed our conversation and the bartender at the pub was pleasant, but the scene didn't get much better.  We asked the bartender about this and she said it's been on a steady decline for years.  That's too bad, maybe one day it will return back to it's former glory.....at least we have some great memories to fall back on.  \u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 30%

VOne of my favorite neighborhood casinos, this place rocks because....\u000a\u000a- There are other things besides gambling here.  Movie theaters, bowling alley, and food!\u000a\u000a- Easy access parking.  The parking garage and the surface lot are very convenient and easy to get in/out.  There's always plenty of parking too, even during special events.\u000a\u000a- Intuitive floor design.  It is always easy to find people and places in the casino.  It's not like a lot of the Vegas casinos where you don't know where the hell you are!\u000a\u000a- Great gambling selection.  Although I no longer gamble, I tell all of my friends who do to play here.  They have loose machines and low limit table games....something for everyone.\u000a\u000a- Decent rooms.  I've only stayed in a 2 bedroom suite here.  It surprised me as it was very elegant and was similar to a few hotels I've stayed at on the Strip.  Gorgeous view of the Las Vegas Valley if you have an East facing room.  Not what I would expect from a locals casino.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's good times here.  Definitely worth checking out if you're in the neighborhood.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  No doubt.

VTime for a review update.  I've stayed at this hotel several times since I moved away a couple of years ago.  I can't comment on the regular rooms as I've only stayed in the suites here.  The 2 bdr suites at the end of the tower are awesome.  They have great views of the city/valley.  The other suites have spectacular views of the golf courses and surrounding area.  They're very spacious and luxurious.\u000a\u000aThe casino and restaurants are still really good.  SC Prime Steakhouse is our fav place to have dinner here....we have dinner here are least once with friends.  Great service and food.  There are low priced restaurant options here as well....snack bar/deli, TGI Fridays, Coffee Shop, Ice Cream.  There's something for everyone.\u000a\u000aWe didn't have time to go bowling this past trip, but we do every once in a while.  There's a ton of lanes and the late night bowling is fun.\u000a\u000aOverall, they're still doing a great job here at the Suncoast.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

VThis is one of the 1st Home Depot stores I went to when I first moved to Vegas in '93.  For a few years, it was the only HD on the Westside of town.  Haven't been here in a long time because several other Home Depot stores popped up that were more conveniently located.\u000a\u000aI was in the neighborhood the other day and popped in here to buy a few things for the yard.  I was able to find a parking space, which was very difficult during it's hey day.  I was in/out within a few minutes.....however, the employees here weren't very helpful.  I tried to flag down a couple to help me find something, but they ignored me and walked past my aisle.  I found what I was looking for on my own.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was an average experience.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Not unless I'm in the area.

VI rarely come to this Vons, but when I do I enjoy it.  It's a bit far from my house, so I only come here when I'm in the area and need to pick up something for dinner.  It's clean and their Vegetables and Bread are always fresh.....those are huge requirements for me.\u000a\u000aI was there this past Sunday because it was the only location nearby that had Early Voting.  I was eager to get it out of the way, so I stopped by in the morning to Vote.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that there were only 3 people in line ahead of me and 20 polling stations....I knew I'd be in/out within minutes.\u000a\u000aAfter I voted, I did a little grocery shopping....why not?  I picked up some items for the family and was able to kill two birds with one stone.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Probably.

Since I was golfing at the Badland's Golf Course nearby, I dropped by this location.  I went through the drive thru and it was very fast and efficient and they got my order correct.\u000a\u000aOverall, A-OK for a fast food joint.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VOK, I don't want to hear that PF Chang's is not authentic Chinese.....everybody knows that.  The family enjoys coming here.  It's been a while for us, so we decided to have a family night out.\u000a\u000aWe ordered the Tofu Lettuce Wraps and Crispy Green Beans to get the night started.  Both were awesome as usual.  One thing about PFC is that they rarely screw up the appetizers.....I can always count on a solid appetizer.\u000a\u000aTheir entrees however are going downhill.  One of my favorite dishes is the Dali Chicken, which is their spiciest Chicken dish.  When it came out, it looked dry and tough.....and it was.  You can almost see how dry it is from the picture I took.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/T3ASfec34b8-uYr3xZj8Lw?select=vefoPIx8FPxegrVmSyeWmg\u000aDamn.....why can't they keep up the consistent quality like they do with their appetizers?!  I also don't like how they only give you a small bowl of Rice.....I have to ask for a 2nd bowl as soon as it's delivered to the table, otherwise I won't get my 2nd bowl before I'm done with my entree.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a nice dinner with the fam.....everyone enjoyed their meal and although mine wasn't perfect, I wasn't going to let it ruin a nice night out.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 67%

VMet some friends and colleagues for drinks and appetizers here last night.  It has been a couple of years since I was here....before the renovation.  I was anxious to see what it looked like.  The Better Half was here recently and said it was nice.  Happy Hour is from 4-7 pm and has $3 Beer, $5 on select glasses of Wine, and $8 Appetizers....normal Appetizers are anywhere from $11-$16, so $8 is a good deal.\u000a\u000aSince there were going to be around 10-12 of us, with some coming and going throughout the evening, we grabbed a table at the bar near the entrance.  The renovation was a success.  I like the new interior much better....it has a nicer feel to it.  The old design felt very stuffy and segregated the room into many sections.  They expanded the bar and made it larger.\u000a\u000aOne thing that hasn't changed though is that this place is not your typical bar in Las Vegas....it's targeting the higher end demographic.  What does that mean?  When I asked the server if they had any IPA's, she said "No, and we don't have any Beer on tap".....I said "What?!  Seriously?!"....she said "We're not THAT kind of bar".....ha ha!  I forgot how pretentious this place was....no big deal, I should have remembered.  So consider yourself warned.....\u000a\u000aThat ended up becoming the joke of the night.  I told the rest of our group about the exchange with the server so we told everyone who arrived to ask the server "Where's the Beer Pong table?" or "Do you have a Golden Tee here?"....ha ha!  The server thought it was funny.\u000a\u000aBack to the experience....we ordered several appetizers.....Oysters, Sliders, Chicken Satay, and Calamari.  Since I don't eat Seafood, I only tried the Sliders and Chicken Satay.  The Sliders were Angus Beef with Grilled Onions & Cheese....very tasty.  The bun was moist & chewy, went well with the Beef.  The Chicken Satay had a nice tangy flavor to it....very delicious.  The rest of the group who tried the Seafood said it was good.\u000a\u000aWe hung out at Sedona for 4 hours or so....we all had a blast.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet!

VI don't come here often, but when I do I order their Chicken Nachos.  As I've mentioned before, after I realized how many calories are in one of these bad boys (2,020 calories!), I reduced the number of visits to Baja Fresh.  That's 3 hours on the Elliptical for me!\u000a\u000aThis location is convenient because it's in a shopping center with Walmart & Sam's Club nearby.....which are 2 places I frequent.  Of course, their signature Salsa Bar and plenty of seating is available.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  When I'm in the mood to gain some poundage, I'll stop by.

VI've been a Sam's Club member for years and this is my favorite store.  Why?  For all of the following reasons:\u000a\u000a- People are nice here.\u000a- For some reason, it's not as busy as all of the other Sam's Clubs I've been to.\u000a- Parking is easy.\u000a- Rarely any lines at the gas station.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  2 or 3 times a month! I'm also a member at Costco and I still come here.

VAnother Golf Course tucked away in a neighborhood.....this one is located in the Northwest off of Ann Rd & US 95 North.  I enjoy coming here during the Summer months and can usually get on the course easily mid-week.  On the weekends it tends to get crowded because their green fees are lower than most courses in town.  Here's my breakdown of the course:\u000a\u000aPROS\u000a- Nice practice facility.  Mats & Grass options, which are nice.\u000a\u000a- It's a nice course for a mid to high level handicap player (15+)....because it's a short course (see CONS).\u000a\u000a- There are a few challenging holes, (#14, 292 yds, par 4) has water on the right side of the fairway and is a slight dogleg right....if you hit the ball long enough, you could cut the water and come close to driving the hole.\u000a\u000aCONS\u000a- Short course.  6,781 yds from the tips, 6,269 from the black tees, ladies tees are at 5,647.\u000a\u000a- No lights on the practice facility and the range is pretty small.....can get crowded when it's busy.\u000a\u000a- The greens are slow.  They're not too challenging.\u000a\u000aI've been coming to this golf course for over 17 yrs, since I moved here in '93.....it's like an old friend.  It's a great course to sharpen up your wedge play and 3 wood (off the tee instead of driver).  Or if you're a beginner, it's pretty forgiving.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I'm sure I will.

VI've ordered delivery from this place and I don't recommend it because the Pizza will be soggy when it arrives....that's like most NY Style Pizzas.....because of the Thin Crust, it can't survive a delivery without getting soggy.\u000a\u000aI wanted to give it a try dining in.....so I stopped by today for lunch.  I intended to order 2 Slices of Pizza....but after reviewing the menu, I couldn't help myself and ordered a NY Hot Dog (Dog, Fries, Green Peppers, Onions, Parmesan Cheese, Italian Roll) and a Slice of Sausage Pizza.\u000a\u000aThe Sausage Pizza Slice came out first.....it was loaded with Sausage....too much in my opinion (see pics).  I also thought the Cheese to Sauce ratio was off.....not enough sauce, the Pizza tasted dry.  The Crust was good and cooked well.....if I was rating just on the Pizza, this place would get 2 or 3 Stars.\u000a\u000aThe NY Hot Dog on the other hand was Fantastic!  The all beef dog was juicy & full of flavor.  The combination of the Fries, Green Peppers, and Onions made the sandwich taste a little like Breakfast.  It was soooo good!  I could have eaten 2 of them!  This NY Hot Dog is what bumped this place to 4 Stars for me since I've never seen this item anywhere else.\u000a\u000aOverall, I enjoyed my experience here.  There are other items on the extensive menu that I want to try.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Fah-getta-bout It, of course!  Probably not for the Pizza though.....ironic.

VI'm not a huge fan of this store.  I normally only go into Ross Stores to pick up something specific.  Today, my son wanted to get a pair of cheap, throwaway sunglasses.\u000a\u000aWe went into the store and found what we were looking for in 3 minutes....unfortunately, it took 20 minutes to check out.  The line was wrapped across the aisle and into the clothing section.  There was only 1 cashier for a long time.  After about 10 minutes, someone finally came to help her.\u000a\u000aI don't like how disorganized this store is.  There is always stuff out of place and it never seems to be in good shape.\u000a\u000aWill I come back?  Only when I have to.

VDropped my car off down the street to get serviced and walked to this Starbucks to grab a cup of Joe and surf the web on the FREE WiFi to kill time until my car was finished.  The weather was cold and windy, so it made the Coffee taste that much better!\u000a\u000aThe service was good....I ordered a Half-Caf and of course it was ready within 30 seconds of paying for it.  Comfortable seating, clean area, friendly employees.....good Starbucks.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 75%

VI can't believe I haven't reviewed this Walmart yet.  It's the one I shop at most often.  I enjoy shopping at this location, here's why:\u000a\u000a- It's clean.  Unlike the Walmart that's closest to my home, this one is always well kept and clean.  Kudos the the employees for keeping it this way.\u000a\u000a- The shopping carts work.  I hate it when I go shopping and the wheels of the cart are jacked up and the cart pulls off to one side.  Or when the carts are filthy and look like they've been carrying trash bags for days....blech!  The carts here are mostly clean and at least 90% of the time they work properly.\u000a\u000a- It's big.  It's a Super Walmart, which means it has groceries plus all of the other stuff from a normal Walmart.  I like the one-stop-shop aspect of it.  I know what people think about "buy local".....but when I'm buying stuff like drain cleaner, I'm not going to a local store to get that.....we don't have local stores that sell that kind of stuff!  Anyway, for the basics that can't be found at a locally owned store, I buy it here.\u000a\u000aThe only negatives about this store for me is the parking lot......many people have no clue how to park/drive.....and the cashier lines.  For some reason, they have 30+ registers, but most of the time only 10 or so are open....which means long lines....and cashiers are slow most of the time so even if there is only 2 or 3 people ahead of you, it takes F-O-R-E-V-E-R!  I guess it's like that at all Walmarts.....probably a function of the shoppers too.\u000a\u000aOverall, not too bad of a shopping experience.  Definitely my favorite Wally-World to shop at.  Return Factor - 80%

VThis is the closest Home Depot to my house, so I come here frequently to pick up stuff for projects.  Since it's the time of year to reseed the backyard, I stopped by yesterday to pick up some grass seed & fertilizer.  I can thank our two numb-nut dogs for this project......they piss all over the grass and the Labradoodle dig holes in the yard all year long, so guess who gets the assignment for the reseed?  \u000a\u000a40 lb bag of Grass Seed......check.\u000a\u000a8 bags of Fertilizer......check.\u000a\u000aThank God the other dog is a Long Haired Chihuahua, otherwise I'd be replacing the entire yard twice a year instead of just patching it up.  Gotta hand it to The Better Half and her selection of dogs.\u000a\u000aThere's not much to say about this Home Depot......it's a standard store.  The employees are pretty friendly and knowledgeable.  It's not as busy as the others in town.   There are self-checkouts.  The Garden area is large and carries everything I needed for this project.  Meets all of my requirements.\u000a\u000aI was in/out in 10 minutes yesterday, so it was a great visit.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Of course.

VStopped by to purchase some replacement balasts for two fluorescent light fixtures.  I only needed one of the balasts and had to return the other.  The return process went smooth, no major issues.  I was in/out in 5 minutes with a full cash refund.\u000a\u000aSide Note/Tip:  While I was waiting to return my merchandise, I overheard the guy in front of me.....he was trying to return a yard blower that broke after 9 months of use.  The cashier at the register told him that products have a 3 month limit on exchanges in situations like that.  That's good to know....90 day return policy at Home Depot.

VThis place showed up as CLOSED on Yelp.  I can tell you that it is OPEN as of 10/31/2010 (see pics).  I came here with my Son searching for a specific mask that he wanted for Halloween.  I hate last minute shopping for anything and I wasn't in the mood to search the entire city for this mask.\u000a\u000aThe employees were very friendly and helpful.  They helped him search for the mask and when they saw that they were out of stock they suggested calling the other Party City locations.  They gave us the phone numbers and while my Son made some calls I wandered around the store and picked up a few Halloween decorations for the house.\u000a\u000aThere was a ton of people in the store, but the line moved quickly.\u000a\u000aOverall Value - The store is great for various types of party supplies, but it lacked the selection for Halloween items that other stores that specialize in Halloween have to offer....of course I'm stating the obvious, but just in case you didn't know.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I saw some cool party supplies for other occasions, so I'm sure I'll be back.

VThere are so many things about NV Energy that I hate.  However, I cannot give them anything lower than 3 Stars because I can't say that they're worse than any other electric company out there....here's a breakdown of my experience with them:\u000a\u000aDo I have power in my home?  YES\u000a\u000aDo I ever have any issues with the power supply that comes to my home? NO\u000a\u000aAre they prompt when responding to a change in name or setting up power for a new home purchase?  YES\u000a\u000aDo they offer online bill payment?  YES\u000a\u000aAre their electricity rates ridiculously high?  YES, my power bill is over $800 per month in the Summer...WTH?\u000a\u000aDo I have a choice of providers? NO\u000a\u000aWhen I step back and look at the overall service of this company, my only beef is the prices.  Is that their fault? or the government's for not allowing Nuclear energy in the State of Nevada?  I don't know....the frustrating part is I can't do anything about it.

VAfter living in the Phoenix area for 3 yrs, we finally had the opportunity to try the legendary Pizzeria Bianco.  We heard all of the horror stories of 2 to 3 hr long waits and to grab yourself a Bottle of Wine and prepare for a long night out....we didn't care and went out on a Monday night to give it a try.  To our surprise, there was NO WAIT at all, YEAH!!!!\u000a\u000aWe were immediately seated at a table (2 top) and given our menus.  It's very dark in the dining room and the menus were a little difficult to read in the ambient light....had to use our cell phone flashlight.  We decided to order:\u000a\u000aSonny Boy w/Sausage \u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pizzeria-bianco-phoenix?select=MyRRg57xLO58zg7bbf2fcg#MyRRg57xLO58zg7bbf2fcg\u000a\u000aBianco Verde w/Prosciutto\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pizzeria-bianco-phoenix?select=39b-Ufs5AEg-UJiR9u5qRg#39b-Ufs5AEg-UJiR9u5qRg\u000a\u000aWhile we were waiting for our food they sat a table of 5 at the 4 top next to us....since the tables are so close, the back of the 5th person's chair was nearly touching our table...that kind of crept into our personal space and was a little uncomfortable.....especially since one of the girls in his party looked at us while getting seated and proclaimed "It's his birthday, woo-hoo!!!".....that's awesome and I hope you guys have a good time, but we came here to dine by ourselves and enjoy each other's company, not join a strangers birthday party....*ugh*...\u000a\u000aOur Pizza came out a short time later.  I had the Sonny Boy w/Sausage added.  I took one bite and instantly became a fan of their Pizza.  It was cooked perfectly with a nice thin crust.  The dough wasn't chewy or undercooked....it was just right.  The Sausage had good flavor and the Pepperoni didn't overwhelm the Pizza.\u000a\u000aThe Better Half had the Bianco Verde w/Prosciutto.  When it came out, it was covered in Greens....LOL, it looked pretty hilarious as I've never seen a Pizza that looked like this before.  It tasted pretty good though.  I had a slice and thought it would suck because of all of the greens on it....it's not something I would personally order, but my Wife enjoyed it and said she'd order it again.\u000a\u000aThe service here was pretty good.  The server was pleasant, friendly, and attentive.  I'm not sure the Pizza is worth a 2 or 3 hr wait, but it's pretty good.  We'd come back on another slow night.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VA throwback to the old mob days, this place rocks.  It reminds me of old school Vegas restaurants that I remember from years ago as a kid.  You park in the back of the restaurant and walk in through the kitchen, how cool is that?!  Before I took a bite of food, I was a fan of this place.  After my first meal, it went to the top of my list.  \u000a\u000aSince that first visit, I've been back several times for lunch and dinner.  It never disappoints.  Some items I've had here:\u000a\u000aWedge Salad w/Gorgonzola\u000aBeefsteak Tomato Salad w/Bleu Cheese Crumbles\u000aFrench Dip\u000a12 oz Filet\u000aChop House Burger w/Cheese\u000aSide of Rice Pilaf\u000a\u000aFor lunch, my 2 fav items are the French Dip and the Chop House Burger w/Cheese.  They're very good and fill you up nice.\u000a\u000aFor Dinner, I always get the Filet.  It's my favorite cut of Beef and Durant's does a great job with their Filet.  I like to have it with a side of Rice Pilaf....yum!\u000a\u000aThe Salads here are pretty big, so I recommend splitting them.  The Wedge Salad is my fav....crispy, juicy Lettuce and creamy Gorgonzola....yes!\u000a\u000aService here is spectacular as well.  Its always been perfect for us.\u000a\u000aI wish I lived closer to this place.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VI love this ballpark.  Definitely one of my favorites....here's why:\u000a\u000a+ Parking is easy.  We usually park in the parking garage in the back of the stadium and walk across the bridge directly into the ballpark.  It's an easy in/out.\u000a\u000a+ Dynamic roof.  The roof opens/closes depending on the weather.  When it gets too hot or when the weather is bad, the roof closes.  When the weather is awesome, like my last visit the other day, it remains open so you can enjoy it.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YgVC9NdMji-VV05w7-E1DQ?select=HpwJuEW2hcJjpCERi4db6g\u000a\u000a+ The Food is pretty good.  Footlong Bratwurst, Popcorn, Chicken Fingers & Fries are some of my favs.  Even though I'm overpaying for it, the quality of the food is very good....better than most I've had.\u000a\u000a+ Seats are comfortable and have a great view of the field.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YgVC9NdMji-VV05w7-E1DQ?select=qRWimTF4uTaiWYUuP_RepQ\u000a\u000a+ Food servers take your order @ your seats and deliver food & drink to you.  I love this service!\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a great baseball experience.  I can't wait to go to the next game.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YgVC9NdMji-VV05w7-E1DQ?select=6aoR5VG-gg4R_UdqHJUrfg\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VTime to update my review...all of the same attributes as my old review apply, but I'm bumping it up one Star, here's why:\u000a\u000a+ The field level seats (lettered section) are awesome.  They're larger, wider, and the aisles are big...very comfortable.\u000a\u000a+ If you sit in the letter section, you have food service where you can order food & drink and they take it out to you...yeah!\u000a\u000a+ Since my last review, I've caught a foul ball thrown to me from the Dbacks dugout, way cool...fulfilled a childhood dream.\u000a\u000a+ This stadium is just so much more comfortable than others I've been at.\u000a\u000aCan't wait to get back to a Dbacks game!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VI've been here a few times and it's always a fun place to go.  Over the summer they have "Happy Hour All Day Every Day"....what?!  What that translates to is low prices on food & drink and a packed house...good times indeed.\u000a\u000aSome of the items I've had during my visits...(Happy Hour Pricing)\u000aEdamame, $3\u000aCoconut Chicken Skewers, $5\u000aKobe Sliders, $8\u000aCrispy Chicken Spring Rolls, $8\u000aBoneless Chicken Wings, $6\u000aRavenswood Vinter's Blend Zinfandel, $7\u000a\u000aAll of the food is delicious.  My favorites are the Kobe Sliders & Boneless Chicken Wings.  The other food is grub too, but these two are my fav's.\u000a\u000aThe bar area is a meat market and if you get a booth or table that has a view of the bar, it's great for people watching...LOL\u000a\u000aFinding a table during peak dinner hours 5-7 pm can be a challenge if you don't have reservations, so I recommend calling in advance.  There are also Teppanaki tables available, if that's your preference....we've never dined there but can see the show from our booth....it looks similar to Benihana.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a fun place to grab some grub and drinks.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 93%

VTime for a review update.  Sapporo always delivers in the clutch.  It's one of the few places outside of Old Town Scottsdale that stays open late every night of the week.....yes, you can find this place open after 10 pm ANY night of the week!  If you're like me and need to find action and energy, this is the place.\u000a\u000aI've already covered the happy hour pricing and some of the food we've had here in my prior review...that is still the case....we love happy hour here.  It's still a meat market and is fun to watch when it gets busy.  A lot of professional baseball and football players hang out here, so there are a lot of groupie wannabe girls that hang out trying to land one of those athletes....they're especially fun to watch trying to get the athletes' attention...LOL\u000a\u000aSince my last review, I've had the BBQ Pork Tacos and they've become one of my fav dishes....add it to the list on the prior review.  These Tacos have a unique flavor and taste.  Instead of a hard corn shell like regular Tacos, they use a crispy Rice shell....and they use a sweet & sour sauce instead of Taco sauce....combine that with the BBQ Pulled Pork and pickled Vegetables....hmmm...so good!\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sapporo-scottsdale?select=gFeRmjpDXp9DsOd2a0uM1g#gFeRmjpDXp9DsOd2a0uM1g\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sapporo-scottsdale?select=QrtOYowxYl5zJMrna6tPlg#QrtOYowxYl5zJMrna6tPlg\u000a\u000aYou can find us here at least once a month or more.  One of these days, we will dine at the Teppanyaki tables....but we've seen that kind of cooking many times before, so we're not really motivated to.  We'll keep coming back though.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VMet a colleague here for lunch recently.  I've been dying to give this place a try because I pass by it frequently.  After browsing the menu, I decided to order off the lunch special menu where you can select a salad, appetizer, and entree for $12.95 or $14.95 depending on the entree selection.  I ordered:\u000a\u000aPickled Cucumber Salad\u000aPork Potstickers\u000aOrange Chicken\u000aFried Rice\u000a\u000aMy order totaled $12.95 for those selections, which is a pretty good deal considering the amount of food you get.\u000a\u000aThe Pickled Cucumber Salad was pretty good....it's very sweet and has a little sour flavor to it.  A nice start for lunch.\u000a\u000aThe Pork Potstickers were just OK.  They were kind of hard on the edges, which means they were left out under a heat lamp too long.\u000a\u000aThe Orange Chicken was OK....very sweet.  The Fried Rice was very good....it helped to lessen the sweetness of the Orange Chicken, so it complimented it very well.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was an average lunch.  I'd consider coming back again.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VWhat can I say about this place?  I'm a big fan.  I love their Burgers.  Located inside the Mandalay Bay, it's a must stop during any Vegas trip for us.  When I lived in Vegas, we visited this joint much more frequently.\u000a\u000aMy favs are:\u000a\u000aAmerican Classic Burger, $14.50 \u000aBlackjack Burger, $13.80\u000aPeppercorn Burger, $16.00\u000aSliders, $13.75\u000a\u000aThe only downside is that it's a bit expensive for a Burger.

VAwesome place to grab a business lunch.  It's tucked away in the Scottsdale Mall near Drinkwater.  In my opinion, the best place to park is the parking garage next to the mall area.  The interior has a modern design and you just feel cool dining here.  For lunch, I like to order:\u000a\u000aDipping Fries, $6\u000a\u000aCheeseburger, $10.25\u000a\u000aThey're 2 very solid choices.  The Cheeseburger is big and fills you up.  It's also very tasty.  The Dipping Fries are delish....I only get them when I'm super hungry or if someone else is willing to split it with me, otherwise I will go back to the office with a serious case of carb coma.\u000a\u000aThe service here is awesome.  If you're here on business, the servers give you space and make sure they don't interrupt too much, but at the same time ensure that you're drink glasses are kept full.\u000a\u000aI highly recommend.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

At the old location, we were cramped inside and took up all of the seats.\u000a\u000aSome of the menu items I've had:\u000a\u000aGarlic Bread, $4.99\u000aToasted Ravioli, $6.99\u000aBruschetta, $7.39\u000aMini Stuffed Pizza, $6.79\u000a18" Thin Crust Numero Uno (Pepperoni, Sausage, Mushrooms, Onions, Green Peppers), $25.50\u000a\u000aThe Garlic Bread is evil.....it's very good and addicting.

We order it "well done" so it comes out crispy and the Cheese has a slight burn on top.  They do it right here....soooo good!\u000a\u000aI was convinced by a co-worker to try the Mini Stuffed Pizza one day....it was good, but I could only have 1 slice, it was too filling.\u000a\u000aThe servers here are great and easily handle the 25 of us and our quirkiness.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 88%

VThis is easily the nicest mall in the Phoenix area....but it's so frustrating.  A few highlights:\u000a\u000aPros\u000a+ It's large. There's many stores to choose from.\u000a+ It's indoors....a huge plus during Summer months.\u000a+ The food court.  Johnny Rockets FTW!\u000a+ Great full service food options, Kona Grill, Yard House, Z Tejas, Cheesecake Factory, and many more.\u000a+ It's clean and well lit.\u000a\u000aCons\u000a- Parking sucks.  I mean it really sucks.  It's a disorganized hot mess of surface lots, parking garages, and valet parking.  It's not convenient by any stretch of the imagination.  The parking garage is just one big mess with small, tight spaces.\u000a- The mall is large and is confusing.  To me, it's not very logical.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's just an OK shopping experience.  I've been to much better malls in California and Vegas.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VA friend of mine got married in Las Vegas a couple of weeks ago and had the ceremony & reception in the Stardust Room here at the Orleans.  This review is of the services rendered for this event.\u000a\u000aThe Stardust room is a large hospitality suite on the top floor of the Orleans.  It faces the Strip and has a small balcony for outdoor views.  The room can hold around 100 comfortably.  The Wedding Party had somewhere around that.  There's a centrally located bar and plenty of cushioned seats.  It's like having your own private Ultra-Lounge.\u000a\u000aThe food served was buffet style and included a wide variety of dishes......Crab Cakes, Quiche, Crab Claws, Shrimp, Chips & Salsa, Southwestern Rolls, and Finger Sandwhiches were a few of the many dishes the bride & groom chose for the party.\u000a\u000aThe servers were excellent and attended to everyone's need.  Food never ran out and the liquor flowed freely.  There was a small dance floor setup in the center of the room and there are plasma TV's on the walls all over the room.  Of course, you can configure it any way you like.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a great event.  My friend and his new Wife enjoyed themselves and were pleased with the Orleans' Staff and Stardust Suite.  The pics I posted will give you a feel for the room.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I'm saving this spot in my memory bank for a future private party.

VThis is a solid local casino to bring friends who visit from out of town.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a- It's near the Strip.  Located a couple of miles from the Strip, it's easy for friends staying on the Strip to get here by cab or rental car.  It also saves us from driving to the Strip to visit them.\u000a\u000a- Great selection of slots & table games.  When friends ask me...."where's a good place to gamble?"....I send them here.  There's something for everybody....and the video poker pay tables are above average.\u000a\u000a- Arena.  The special events arena is great to watch concerts and specialty shows.  Over the years, we've gone to horse shows, halloween parties, and concerts in the arena.  It's small enough where there's not really a bad seat in the house.\u000a\u000a- Decent food options.  The food options here aren't bad.  For the discriminating foodie, there's a Friday's located in the middle of the casino.  My favorite place is Fuddrucker's....which is located near the poker room.\u000a\u000a- Movie theaters.  The movie theaters here are pretty good and always have the latest movies.  They keep the theaters in pretty good shape.\u000a\u000a- Buffet.  The buffet here is decent, not great, but decent.\u000a\u000aOverall, we always have a good time when we are at The Orleans.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 87.8%

VOne of my favorite casinos in Vegas.  This place has it all.....great nightlife, awesome food, decent rooms, pool parties, movie theater, celebrities, locals, food court, convenient parking, awesome view of the city from the rooftop of two clubs.....what more could you ask for?  Seriously?\u000a\u000aWhenever someone asks me "I'm coming to Vegas for the 1st time, where should I stay?"....the Palms is at the top of my list of recommendations.  It is the perfect example of a Vegas Experience.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 98%

VHigh end shopping, hotel, restaurants, and gambling....if you can't afford it, don't complain when you get here.  There are other hotel/casino properties in Vegas that will accommodate your budget.\u000a\u000aSome can't miss places here:\u000a\u000a- Conservatory & Botanical Garden.....this is spectacular, especially during the holiday season.  They change up the garden every few months, so you'll see something new often.\u000a\u000a- The Chihuly Glass in the lobby.  Amazing stuff, it's on the ceiling so look up.\u000a\u000a- Bellagio Fountains (separate review).  Awesome show....best seen when it's not windy though.\u000a\u000a- High end shopping mall near the entrance at the Strip.\u000a\u000a- Cirque du Soleil "O"......spectacular show that features water and acrobatics.\u000a\u000aWe love this place and enjoy coming here a few times a year even though it's on the Strip.

VThis review is for the casino and public areas only.\u000a\u000aI enjoy this property and here's why:\u000a\u000a- When we have out of town visitors, it is a fun place to take them.....they can gamble while we do other things, like.....\u000a\u000a- Kiddo can ride the roller coaster and play games in the arcade.\u000a\u000a- There are plenty of bars and restaurants to hang out at.  Most notably the piano bar, which can get packed and be a lot of fun.  Also, Il Fornaio has bomb Bread and Italian Food.  I've also recently discovered the Sporting House (separate review), which is great for Beer and eats.\u000a\u000a- Easy access from I-15.  Since it's located on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd & Tropicana, it's an easy in/out for locals....the entrance on Tropicana is convenient.\u000a\u000a- Parking garage is relatively close to the action.  It's not a long walk to/from the parking garage.\u000a\u000a- MGM & Monte Carlo are a short walk away.  If we get bored, it's not a bad walk to either of these hotels, which gives us plenty of choices for entertainment and fun.\u000a\u000aOverall, I recommend friends to stay here if they want to be in the thick of things without spending too much money.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  In a New York Minute.....wait, is that good or bad?  Of course I will!

VMy last review was written as a Vegas local, time to update my review.  Since I moved out of town a few years ago, we've stayed here twice.  In addition to the points I made with my last review, which still hold true, I'd want to add that the rooms are a little small  compared to other rooms at the hotels on the Strip.\u000a\u000aDespite the small rooms, this is still a fun hotel to stay at because of the location.  It's close to the MGM Grand and Hakkasan and not too far from Mandalay Bay and City Center.  I'd stay here again if the room rates are at a good price.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 75%

VBefore the word "Staycation" was chic and cool, we would take weekends off and stay here.  We enjoy Paris for the following reasons:\u000a\u000a- It's location in the center of the Strip.  You can easily access many of the other Strip properties from here.\u000a\u000a- The view of the Bellagio Fountains.  As I described in another review, we love the Fountains @ the Bellagio.  You can request a room with a Strip/Fountain view and if you're lucky enough to get it, you'll be treated to a wonderful scene.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz/fountains-of-bellagio-las-vegas#hrid:5mSBxtxJXkCKC2b1hRys8A\u000a\u000a- Monorail station.  The monorail station stops at Bally's, which is next door to Paris and easily accessed.  I'm a fan of the Monorail, so it's always a bonus to be near a station.\u000a\u000a- Decent food selection.  One of our favorite restaurants in the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  While we don't eat here often, we make it a point to do so if we have a weekend getaway here @ Paris.  The Buffet is ok and the Italian joint is pretty good too.  A little something for everyone.\u000a\u000aOverall, we always have a pleasant experience here.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You can count on it.

It's a pretty cool place to go and has added a different element to the resort experience here.\u000a\u000aWe've also dined at Mon Ami Gabi a few times as well.  Excellent restaurant with an inside/outside feel.  Dining on the patio is great for people watching.\u000a\u000aWith these new experiences combined with our past experiences, this is one of our fav's to visit on the Strip.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 88%

VThis review is strictly for the swimming pool.  A friend of mine was visiting and stayed at the Monte Carlo.  We made plans to hang out at the pool all day on Saturday.  We got there around 10 am and lucked out and found 2 lounge chairs.\u000a\u000aThe swimming pool has 2 small lazy rivers and a small wave pool.  There were a lot of kids at the pool, but they didn't really get in the way that much.  Dance & Hip Hop music was playing on speakers and every once in a while they had competitions for various prizes.....like being on a cruise ship pool deck.\u000a\u000aThere's a bar conveniently located towards the backside of the 2nd lazy river and they have cocktail & food service to the cabanas & lounge chairs.  Our server Samantha "Sam" was very cool and kept us hydrated with Water, Shock Top, Mai Tais, and Jamaican Rum Runners all day long.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a great time.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Most definitely!

VOne of my favorite hotel/casinos in Vegas, the Venetian is usually where we like to meet friends from out of town for a drink or dinner.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a- The casino is huge and the property has a little bit of something for everyone.  You can't go wrong here.\u000a\u000a- There's a ton of shopping in the Canal Shoppes Mall on the 2nd floor.\u000a\u000a- The decor and design is amazing.  There's plenty of photo ops here.\u000a\u000a- The selection of restaurants allows for small to high budgets.\u000a\u000a- It's connected to the Palazzo, so there are even more choices for you and your guests.\u000a\u000aOver the years I've been here at least 100 times.  Will I return?  Of course.

They've been able to keep the property looking great, continue to offer awesome restaurants, and have a couple of the best nightclubs in town.  Whenever I'm back in Vegas, I come here to eat, dine, party, or stay.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VThis review is for the Meeting Space facilities at the Mirage.\u000a\u000aI attend a lot of Trade Shows throughout the year and a few of them are held at the Mirage.  I have a bittersweet feeling about those shows as the Mirage is both a good and bad spot for them.  Here's why:\u000a\u000aPROS\u000a- The meeting rooms are in great condition.\u000a\u000a- The ventilation is just right.  The temperature is appropriate for the large crowds....whether it's AC in the Summer or Heating in the Winter, they get it right.\u000a\u000a- The banquet and meeting staff is always professional, both in terms of appearance and manners.\u000a\u000a-  The layout of the meeting rooms allows for good foot traffic flow between rooms.\u000a\u000aCONS\u000a- Parking here is a mess.  The Self Parking Garage can get full very quickly and the parking spaces are tight.  Valet is a nightmare....you can count on at least a 45 minute wait for large conventions if you Valet.\u000a\u000a- Distance from parking to meeting rooms.....it is a very long walk from the Parking Garage to the meeting rooms.  Valet is not much closer.  It can make for a very long day, especially when you're walking around the Trade Show floor all day.\u000a\u000a- Restaurant options are far from the meeting rooms.  Yes, there is a coffee shop nearby that sells sandwiches, but that line can get really long during large shows......your only option is to venture out into the casino floor and the restaurants are scattered throughout the property.  There aren't any good quick eats option there.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a good experience....not great.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Only because I have to.

VAnother one of my favorite places in Vegas.  We come here several times a year and always have a good time.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a- Tons of dining options.  There's something for everyone.....buffets, food court, mid-level restaurants (Wolfgang Puck's), high-end restaurants (Joel Robuchon), steakhouse (Craftsteak), it goes on and on.\u000a\u000a- MGM Grand Arena.  Major concert & sporting events are held here and it's an easy in/out.  They have the process nailed for crowd control.\u000a\u000a- KA from Cirque du Soleil.  One of my favorite shows in town.\u000a\u000a- Large parking garage.  It might take you a while to find a parking space, especially if there's a big event like UFC here, but you'll eventually find a space.....the parking garage is HUGE!\u000a\u000a- Monorail station.  It's on the monorail station......here's a tip...if you want to attend an event at the MGM Grand Arena and you're not staying here or are a local and don't want to deal with the crazy parking situation all you have to do is park at any of the hotels on the monorail line and take the monorail to/from the MGM Grand.....it will dump you right in front of the Arena for easy in/out......it makes the $ spent on the round trip ticket worthwhile.  I've done this dozens of times, trust me.\u000a\u000a- Tons of gambling options.  From low end to high end gaming there is something for everyone.  Plus they have a huge poker room.\u000a\u000a- Terrace Suites.  These overlook the Strip and have a huge outdoor patio to them.....awesome suites.\u000a\u000aSome negatives to this joint are the older rooms that are a little small by New Vegas Standards.  Since the property is so large it's a little cumbersome for people to find their way around, especially if they're unfamiliar with the joint.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Of course!

VTime to update my review.  I'm upgrading this place to 5 Stars because of the following reasons:\u000a\u000a+ Despite being 20 yrs old, this resort/casino is always changing and building new concepts to keep fresh and maintain their lead in the market.\u000a\u000a+ They built the most expensive, best nightclub in the world in Hakkasan.  Not only did they build it, they also signed some of the top DJ's in the world to exclusive contracts to play in Vegas.\u000a\u000a+ Their Wet Republic pool parties are one of the best in Vegas.  We look forward to every pool season.\u000a\u000aThese new points are in addition to the points in my prior review.  Whenever we come back to Vegas, this place is on our list to visit.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VThis property is always on the list of places we take visitors from out of town.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a- It's in the heart of the Northern part of the Strip.  Very close to the Mirage, Caesar's Palace, Venetian, Palazzo, Wynn, and Encore.  You can knock down a lot of birds with one stone here.\u000a\u000a- The parking garage is easy to get in/out of.  The entrance is near Spring Mtn Road and for locals is a breeze because you don't have to deal with the Strip.\u000a\u000a- The restaurants and bars are above average.  We don't eat here often, but our friends who do are always satisfied.\u000a\u000a- Rooms are reasonably priced here and aren't too bad despite being built in 1993.\u000a\u000aWill we return?  I'm sure we will.

VTime for a review update.  The main thing this place has going for it right now is it's location.  If you're in town for a convention at the Venetian/Palazzo, it's a cheap option for staying near the Sands Expo and Convention Center.  Room rates are generally 1/2 of the price of the Venetian/Palazzo.\u000a\u000aWe stayed here twice this past year for conventions we were attending and the only place we went to at the hotel was Gilley's for country/western music & dancing.  The rest of the property is not too exciting....by Vegas standards.\u000a\u000aWe've seen Mystere half a dozen times so there's no real incentive to watch it again.\u000a\u000aThe rooms are just ok, nothing special.  Keep your expectations realistic.  Hopefully, the property doesn't decline any further as it's already 20 yrs old now.  As long as they remain a cheap alternative for rooms during conventions, we'll keep coming back from time to time.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

VThis place has seen better days.  The building is old and in need of a serious renovation or even better, to be imploded and start from scratch.  The smoke here is dense and the ventilation is subpar compared to the newer joints in Vegas.\u000a\u000aThe funny thing is that it's always packed.  Probably because it's center strip and rooms go for $25-$35 often.  In my opinion, I'd rather pay the extra $20-$30 and stay at the Flamingo, which is next door.  Low limit tables are also the name of the game here....so the low end gamblers have a home too.\u000a\u000aOverall, I would never spend my money to stay here or recommend it for my friends.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 10%

VWhile I was back in Vegas for a conference a small group of us decided to drop by and grab a meal.  It was about 8 pm and it was packed and a long line of people waiting to get in.  The hostess told us it would be 1.5 to 2 hrs....wow!  We could get seated right away if we sat outside....but it was raining off/on, so we'd have to take a chance.  I walked outside and they have umbrellas, so we took a chance and chose to get seated immediately.\u000a\u000aLuckily for us it didn't rain while we dined...ha!  I ordered:\u000a\u000aFilet Mignon Merlot - (w/Butter, Red Wine Reduction) $34.95\u000aMacaroni Gratin - $6.95\u000a\u000a....to wash it down, we ordered a bottle of Malbec for $58.\u000a\u000aWhile we waited for our food, it rained a little bit.  However, with the umbrellas and patio space heaters, we were comfortable and dry.  It was actually kind of cool to sit outside on the Las Vegas Strip and watch the clouds pass overhead and rain on the city.  In the 20+ yrs I lived in Vegas, I never had an experience like that.  Having Wine during the rainfall was even better.\u000a\u000aThe food came out after a while and my Filet was cooked perfectly.  I ordered it Medium-Well with just a little "pink".  The Red Wine Reduction was heavenly and smooth on the palate.  The Mac Gratin was rich and complimented the Filet very well.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was an awesome dining experience.  Don't know if I can replicate the ambiance and scenario.  The waiter was super cool and handled the weather/packed restaurant situation very well.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VThis place has seen better days.  They had the opportunity to implode this thing and start from scratch in the late 90's....instead, they chose to renovate.  Now, it's just a shell of it's former self.....always has that "empty" feeling to it, unless there's a citywide event that sells out the city.\u000a\u000aThe casino is tired and the restaurants are just ok.  The best thing about it is the roller coaster.\u000a\u000aOverall, I wouldn't recommend any of my friends to stay here.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 10%

VThe Peppermill is a favorite of both locals & tourists.  The atmosphere and decor is a throwback to the Vegas of the 70's-80's.  One of the highlights of the property is the fireside lounge, which features an open fire pit that people can hang around.  The bright purple & blue neon flashes you back to the hey day of Vegas.\u000a\u000aFood - They offer a wide variety of dishes from Breakfast to Dinner.  Since I started working very close to the Peppermill, I will be here often for lunch.  Today I decided to give the Chicken Pesto sandwich a try.  It was very tasty and the serving was huge.  A nice sized portion of fries comes with the dish.\u000a\u000aService - Most of the time, they are very busy and you'll have to wait a little while for a table.  However, they crank out the orders and you get served in decent time.  It's hit or miss though as sometime you'll wait a while if they're really slammed.\u000a\u000aI gave this place 4 Stars because I've been a fan of it since I moved here in '93.  I will always return as long as they keep their atmosphere, food, and service the same.  Almost gave it 5 Stars, but the only thing that held me back was the hit or miss on the service levels.

VHad breakfast today with some friends.  We sat in Crystal's section.  She's a great server....she was very attentive and ensures that you're well taken care of.  It was a business breakfast, so she allowed us private time to handle business and when we were ready for food, she came by to take our order.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Belgian Waffles this morning.  The waffle was very good....not under/over cooked like I experience at some restaurants.\u000a\u000aMy favorite part about this place is that it's a throwback....not only in decor, but in service.  Everyone there is friendly and works hard to ensure your meal goes well.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet!

VOnce upon a time, this was an awesome property.  Now, it's suffering from old age and a lack of investment.  Here's the breakdown:\u000a\u000aPROS\u000a- Pretty cool pool area.  In my opinion, this is the best part of the hotel.....it's tropical, has real pink flamingos, and is fun.\u000a\u000a- Cheap rates.  You can find rooms in the high $30's to $40 range here often.  I send my budget minded friends here.\u000a\u000a- Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville.  This place is a lot of fun.  It overlooks the Strip and has decent eats and fun music.  I'll have to write a separate review one day for it.\u000a\u000a- Cheap gambling.  Most of their table games have low minimum bets.\u000a\u000a- Location.  It's center Strip and It's on the monorail line.  Easy access up and down the East side of the Strip from the Sahara to the MGM Grand on the monorail.  Reasonable walking distance from Paris to Palazzo (50% of the Strip).\u000a\u000aCONS\u000a- It's old and it shows.  This place peaked in the mid-90's.\u000a\u000a- It reeks of smoke.  The last time I was there I walked from the parking garage to Margaritaville and back without stopping in the casino.  However, when I got home my clothes smelled as if I was out all night gambling and smoking cigarettes.  Blech.\u000a\u000a- Parking garage has small, tight spaces.  This is one of my least favorite parking garages in the city.  The spaces are small and I'm always afraid that my car is going to get scratched or dented.....because it has happened in the past. \u000a\u000a- They have timeshare sales people that will bother you when you walk by their booth.  I'm not a fan of this at all.  Who wants to be bothered like that on vacation or on a night out?  It's no different than those escort card smackers on the Strip.\u000a\u000aOverall, you have to understand what you're getting here and it's cheap.  So if you're on a budget, this hotel is for you.....but don't have high expectations otherwise you'll be disappointed.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Sure.

VTime for a review update....you can read my prior one for more details, but it's been a while since I wrote it and many of the items still apply.  In my opinion, the absolute best time to stay here  is the weekend when Jimmy Buffet plays in Vegas.  He plays Vegas every year at the MGM Grand, but he has a Margaritaville restaurant/bar located at the Flamingo and it's one giant Parrothead party all weekend long.  \u000a\u000aAfter we left Vegas 3 yrs ago, we make the annual pilgrimage back to Vegas for this weekend and stay here.  The rooms are cheap and not the best in town, but we are willing to trade off quality for the party atmosphere and not having to go back and forth to another hotel....it's fun!  Besides that, you can take the monorail from the Flamingo to the MGM Grand right at the Arena where he plays....easy access to the concert.\u000a\u000aWe can't wait to go back next year!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VThis property has gone severely downhill over the past 5 or 6 yrs.  A friend of mine recently stayed here and I went to visit him.  The room was very plain and felt old, despite only being around 10 yrs old.  He stayed in one of the towers, not the Pyramid.\u000a\u000aThe casino floor and restaurants have been updated over the past few years to have a younger appeal.  There is almost no remnants of the old Egyptian theme.  I'm kind of nostalgic and miss it, but realize they have to do what they must to remain relevant.  \u000a\u000aDon't know if anyone remembers the old Nile river and ride they use to have when it opened.  I was in college back then and I had a few friends who were tour guides on the boats.  They also had live Camels that lived in the back behind the parking garage that they used for a show.  Ahhh, the good ol' days.\u000a\u000aThe restaurants, bars, lounges, and clubs they have here are for the hipsters and generate large crowds at night and on the weekends and holidays.  We don't come here very often, but enjoy having a few drinks when we're here.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  As long as I'm in Vegas, friends will always visit, so I'm sure I will.

VOver the past few years, they've remodeled and repositioned this property to target more of the younger crowd.  Most of the Egyptian design elements are gone and have been replaced by ultra-lounges and nightclubs.  The number of slot machines and table games have been drastically reduced over the years.\u000a\u000aWe've stayed here a couple of times and the rooms are ok.  They're not the most luxurious rooms in the city, but they're comfortable.  The best rooms are in the towers and not in the pyramid.  The rooms in the pyramid are older and smaller.  If you have a choice, I'd recommend staying in the hotel towers....unless you want to stay in a pyramid, which is cool to do at least once.\u000a\u000aThe food options here are ok, nothing special by Vegas standards.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VEasily one of my favorite hotels in Vegas.  I highly recommend this place to all of my friends and family who visit.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a- Great selection of rooms.  You really have 3 choices of rooms & service here.....Mandalay Bay has mid-level rooms/service, THEhotel has great rooms/service, and the Four Seasons has excellent rooms/service.  The giant 2 bedroom suite at the end of the towers of Mandalay Bay are my favorite.\u000a\u000a- Parking is easy.  The self parking and valet parking here is so easy.  The parking garage at the rear of the property has easy access from Frank Sinatra drive or Mandalay Bay Dr.  For locals or tourists it's an easy in/out.\u000a\u000a- Great selection of restaurant choices.  From high end restaurants to cheap eats, there's something for everyone....and it's good food too.\u000a\u000a- Lots of bars and lounges.  Everyone can find a place to have a drink and enjoy themselves.....from hipsters to regular joe's, there's something for everyone.\u000a\u000a- Decent limits on table games.  You can find $10 min bet blackjack here on occasion.  There's also a good selection of slots and other table games.\u000a\u000a- The vibe here is awesome.  I can't explain it, but I always feel good here.  The people and the vibe are always energizing.\u000a\u000a- Great entertainment.  The House of Blues and the Mandalay Events Center always has great entertainers in their lineup.\u000a\u000a- Walkway to Luxor.  If you want a different experience, you can easily walk to the Luxor via a connecting mall area without going outside.  This is huge during the sweltering Summer months.\u000a\u000aOverall, this place has a little bit of everything for everyone....and they do it well.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet I will!

VOne of our favorite hotels on the Strip.  It's a non-gaming hotel attached to Mandalay Bay.  It's classy and upscale.  When you're in it, you really don't feel that you're part of the Mandalay Bay.  \u000a\u000aThey did a great job keeping it disconnected from the other property.  If you go in the main entrance, then you won't have to walk through the casino at all.\u000a\u000aThis hotel is always at the top of my recommendation list when people are looking for a nice getaway from all of the glitz and glamour of the Las Vegas Strip.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VHad a few friends visiting from out of town this weekend, so we decided to get together for dinner here.  The Better Half & I have been here once back in July 2007.  We didn't really care for it then, but decided to give it another shot.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Filet & she ordered the Salmon.  The table split a bunch of side dishes; Fries, Creamy Potatoes, Spinach, Mushroom & Peas Risotto, Asparagus, Potatoes Au Gratin.  My Filet was cooked to my liking, but it was underwhelming.  The flavor was good, but it was missing "something"....it didn't make me want more.  Wifey enjoyed her Salmon, but said it wasn't great.  The sides were underwhelming too....the Potatoes Au Gratin were very runny, the highlight was the Fries.\u000a\u000aI split a Buffalo Mozzarella Salad with a friend of mine for an Appetizer & it was too soft & runny for my tastes.\u000a\u000aThe best part about dinner was the wine.  We had a Magnum of 2005 Faust Cabernet Sauvignon, which was excellent!  It had a nice bold flavor and had hints of Blackberry & a slight peppery taste to it.  It went well with the steak.\u000a\u000aOverall, the experience was underwhelming.  Certainly not worth the $355 for Wifey & I.  We've had much better dinners for much less.\u000a\u000aWill we return?  Unless someone else pays for it, probably not.

VLocated in Downtown Las Vegas, this is one of my favorite shopping places in Vegas, here's why:\u000a\u000aPROS\u000a- Great selection of stores.  Dolce & Gabana, Banana Republic, Vitamin World, Nike, Adidas, Coach, Armani Exchange, Michael Kors, 2b Bebe.....there's something for the entire family.\u000a\u000a- Decent food options.  Besides the food court, there's an AYCE Sushi joint, Makino's, that the family loves.\u000a\u000a- Outdoor shopping.  I prefer outdoor shopping to indoor shopping.  Can't tell you why, but I do.\u000a\u000a- Parking.  You'll see this in the CONS too.....the PRO is that there are a ton of spots between two large parking garages & a surface lot.\u000a\u000a- It's  not as crazy busy as the Outlet Mall on the Strip, but most of the stores are the same and there are more premium brands here.\u000a\u000aCONS\u000a- Parking.  I think Parking sucks here....the parking garage has tight spaces and the flow of traffic in the garage is always slow.\u000a\u000aI visit this mall at least once a month on average.  During the Christmas Season, at least once or twice a week....I enjoy window shopping here.\u000a\u000aHere's a tip.....go to the mall office and ask them if they have any discounts or coupons.  More often than not, they will have 10% or 20% Off coupons that are good at most stores.....they usually distribute these to tour groups, but if you ask, they'll give it to you.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Hell yeah!

VI'll have to admit, I thought this mall would rapidly decline over the past 3 years since I wrote my last review.  With the economic downturn and the overall decline of Las Vegas, I thought for sure it would suffer.  However, I was wrong.  It's time for a review update...\u000a\u000aAll of the Pros/Cons from my prior review still hold true.  The only thing I can add is to the CONS....this mall has a ton of those annoying kiosks that sell perfume, jewelry cleaning, and other stuff....what makes it annoying are the sales people who make cat calls at you as you walk by....it feels like I'm at a Middle Eastern "souk".  I just act like I can't speak English and walk right by them.\u000a\u000aBesides that one annoying item, it's still a solid place to do some shopping.  There are some great stores here and I'm surprised they didn't leave during the economic downturn.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

VAttended a private party hosted by a good friend of mine here during the G2E convention last week.  It was held on the patio overlooking the Strip.  It was catered buffet style and had a hosted open bar.....sweet!\u000a\u000aOn the buffet they had Pizza, Empinadas, Beef & Chicken Kabobs, and a bunch of other stuff I can't remember right now.  On the Dessert buffet there was a large selection of Cheesecakes.....again, I can't remember.  The hosted bar got the best of me.....I guess that's what happens when you drink several classes of Wine, ha!\u000a\u000aThe patio was awesome with a great view of the Strip.  The club staff was very friendly and the weather was perfect!  The DJ was playing a combination of funky house and hip-hop.....I wish he would have stuck with the funky house....but it was a pretty good vibe nonetheless since it wasn't that angry gangsta hip-hop.\u000a\u000aThe booths and cabanas were comfortable as they each had heaters although it wasn't too cold.  I actually had to ask a bouncer to shut off the heater in our cabana.\u000a\u000aOverall it was a great night of partying and networking.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  For a private party....you bet I will!

VBuffet of Buffets Marathon - Stop #7 of 7 6:30 PM (actual time was 7 PM)\u000a\u000aAfter leaving Paris, I drove next door to Planet Hollywood to cap off the night with the final stop in the Buffet of Buffets Marathon, the Spice Market Buffet.  There was a concert (George Clinton) in the theater, so parking was tough and we didn't get to the buffet until 7 PM.\u000a\u000aEven though I was completely stuffed from the 6 prior buffets, I somehow found the room to go for a final plate.  This buffet is one of the largest of the 7 and offers Mediterranean fare, which is unique to the other buffets. \u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Fi-2ruy5x600SX4avnrFuA?select=vV2f1x98dos-4W17IMuQBA \u000a\u000aI decided to have some Chinese food, Pizza, and Penne Pasta.....had to stick with my No Meat diet and these were the most appetizing items I found.  There's plenty here for omnivores....I'll have to come back when I'm off the wagon.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Fi-2ruy5x600SX4avnrFuA?select=pNEmoWdn6iNT-b9VrBJM-w\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Fi-2ruy5x600SX4avnrFuA?select=4qodQ7gEHBC3bIOLVFgX6g\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Fi-2ruy5x600SX4avnrFuA?select=xsm1D_pt_lknFpNlUwYXiw\u000a\u000aThe food was pretty good.  If I had more room, I'd go for some of the Mediterranean items.....the other Yelpers who tried it said it was pretty good.  I'll take their word for it.\u000a\u000aOur server was friendly and kept our glasses full.  We were seated in the middle of the buffet so we had easy access to the entire line of food.  Good stuff.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VMystere was one of the 1st shows I saw when I moved to Vegas in '93.  It opened at the Treasure Island and it was a tough ticket to get at the time.  It was amazing to me back then and I still enjoy it today, although since I've seen it over 5x, it's very predictable....nevertheless, I still like it.\u000a\u000aThere's a nice combination of acrobats, performance, and of course the great music.  The drums are my favorite part of the show.  I always recommend this show to out of town guests as it's one of the more reasonably priced Cirque shows in town.....mostly because it's the oldest and in less demand than the others.\u000a\u000aWill I return? I'm sure I will.

VThis hotel is awesome.  It's much nicer than the regular hotel at Mandalay Bay.  The rooms are more larger and more spacious.  The beds are more comfortable and the toiletries and amenities are much nicer.  \u000a\u000aHowever, you don't have to give up the convenience or location.  The lobby connects right into the heart of the Mandalay Bay casino, so you're right in the thick of things.\u000a\u000aOf course to get access to all of this it will cost you at least 30-40% more than a room at Mandalay Bay....but it's worth every penny.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VAnother awesome Cirque du Soleil show.  This one features acrobatic performers and water.  I'm always amazed at how they can pull off all of these moves in such an elegant and choreographed way.  My hat's off to the performers!\u000a\u000aI don't want to give away too much, but this show will simply amaze you.  It's worth seeing more than once.  There's no way I can keep my eye on everything going on.  Every time I see this show I see something different.\u000a\u000aDefinitely worth the time and money while you're in Vegas.  When out of town visitors ask me what show to see when they're in Vegas, I mention this one as one of the Top 5 in town.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Can't wait for the next time!

VI am a fan of Cirque du Soleil (except the Criss Angel show, blech!)....Ka is  one of the reasons why I'm a fan.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a- The music is phenomenal.  Like most Cirque shows, the music just blows you away....and it works so well with the performance.\u000a\u000a- Great acrobatics & physical feats.  Again, Cirque doesn't disappoint.\u000a\u000a- Awesome sets.  I don't want to give away too much, but there's a scene where the stage lifts up and goes vertical from a horizontal position....absolutely crazy....and the performers on the stage?  All I can say is WOW!\u000a\u000aSome tips....\u000a\u000a- Make sure you look all around you....to the left, right, and above you....there's a lot going on and you don't want to miss it.\u000a\u000a- Use the bathroom before the show starts.  Again, you don't want to miss a minute of the action.\u000a\u000a- Bring a coat or sweater.  It can get a little cold in the theater.\u000a\u000aOverall, great show.  One of my fav's in town, in my Top 10.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I plan on it.

VBuffet of Buffets Marathon - Stop #1 of 7 9:00 AM\u000a\u000aThe first stop in the BoB tour, I was very excited and had a game plan of trying to pace myself.....that plan flew out the window within 5 minutes...ha!\u000a\u000aThe line wasn't long at all and our party of 6 was seated right away in a comfortable table near the buffet.  Since it was breakfast, I went for some Potatoes, Sticky Bun, and a Veggie Omelet on the 1st round.....the Omelet was huge and was the item that put me off pace.  It was all very good.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ou8pYS24azDWG0ru_vUcqg?select=1_0JKkNJl0voH_6aTkzFIA\u000a\u000aThen, someone in the group mentioned that there was Pizza....what?!  At breakfast?!  I had to try it.....so I grabbed two slices of Pizza....that really blew my plan out of the water!  The Pizza was OK....I should have only had 1 slice, but I couldn't help it.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ou8pYS24azDWG0ru_vUcqg?select=BFsZj4u00m9buYo5LvZERw\u000a\u000aThey were serving Champagne and Mimosas, so that was a nice bonus....yum!\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ou8pYS24azDWG0ru_vUcqg?select=aSlc68DA1JhT9mYuyeQpQg\u000a\u000aOverall, the service was very good, the selection and quality of food was above average.  If I wasn't on my no-Meat fast I would have tried the carving station and had a few more items....next time.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VI spent the past week at a conference at Green Valley Ranch.  Their banquet & catering staff did an awesome job.  The rooms were very clean and the A/V equipment was top notch.\u000a\u000aThe lunches we had during the conference were spectacular.  I don't eat fish, so when they served Salmon for lunch on Day 1 I asked for an alternative dish.  They quickly threw together a grilled vegetable dish that was ridiculously good.  I would have paid for it!  Then there are the desserts..........soooo good!  (see pics)\u000a\u000aI don't come to Green Valley Ranch often since it's in Egypt from where I live....but when I do, it's a great experience.\u000a\u000aWill I come back?  If I come back to Egypt, of course!

VI recently spent 4 days here attending a conference.  The conference staff does a great job putting on events.  I've attended many conferences here and they've always kept the service levels very high.  During one of the lunches during the program, they served a Cheese Ravioli which was amazing...yum!\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/green-valley-ranch-resort-and-spa-henderson-2?select=YoRrgRX9pDs_3uj-RhMKnw#YoRrgRX9pDs_3uj-RhMKnw\u000a\u000aDuring this particular conference I also stayed in the hotel.  The rooms are well appointed and the bed is very comfortable.  The pillows are large and soft and you feel like you're falling asleep on a cloud.  Needless to say, I slept very well that week.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/green-valley-ranch-resort-and-spa-henderson-2?select=umFvzSSloFFPxmfHAkghpA#umFvzSSloFFPxmfHAkghpA\u000a\u000aThe casino was very slow the days I stayed here, which was in the middle of the week.  It looked like a ghost town.  Not much going on at the bars/lounges either.  Hank's Steakhouse has awesome desserts (see other review) and the Cafe was terrible (see other review).\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a great place to stay with hit/miss food options.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 82%

VFun place to shoot pool, drink some Beer, and people watch.  We went on a Saturday night and this place was packed.  Kind of difficult to find parking nearby, but once we got in, it was a lot of fun.\u000a\u000aWe were lucky enough to find an open pool table in the back, so we grabbed it and watched the band and people on the dance floor.  After shooting a few games of pool, we ordered some Nachos and a Quesadilla.  The food was OK, nothing great.  Service was kind of slow....our Beers were empty a lot.\u000a\u000aDespite it's shortfalls, it is still a decent place to be entertained.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 77%

VShowed up at 7:05 pm on a Thu night to use a Groupon.  They had some ridiculous comedy show that was starting at 8 pm and were requiring tickets.  The guy at the front door says "Sorry, no Groupons today, it says there right on the door"\u000a\u000aMe - "The Groupon says Sun-Thu."\u000a\u000aHim - "The Groupon also says not valid on special events.  Tonight is a special event."\u000a\u000aMe - "We checked the website before we drove all the way down here just so we can get notified at the door about a special event?! The website doesn't say anything about a special event tonight.  We don't care about the comedy show, we just want to use our Groupon....we'll eat and get out of there before the stupid comedy show starts."\u000a\u000aHim - "I'm sorry, no."\u000a\u000aWe storm out of there.  What a sham....we drove all the way to this dump just to be notified at the door that it's a special event?!  What kind of notification is that?  If I would've known about this I wouldn't have purchased the stupid thing.  I promptly emailed Groupon and requested a refund, which they promptly gave to me within 12 hrs.\u000a\u000aI've been here before to play pool and have a few Beers...but no mas, Eli's you've lost my business.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 0.005%

VWe've attended the Muhammad Ali Celebrity Fight Night event the past 3 yrs here and it's a top notch event.  The reason why it's a great event is because of this resort and it's staff.  From the time you pull up into the valet area next to the ballroom until you pick up your car 8 hrs later, it's a 5 Star experience.\u000a\u000aThe banquet staff ensures that you're every need is attended to.  Champagne, Wine, and Spirits are served from several bars scattered throughout the ballroom & pre-function space.  There's never a line of more than a few people at the bars.  The passed hors d'oeuvres are delicious.  The meal is pretty good as well.  We went with the Vegetarian option, which was an Eggplant Cannelloni.  The Dessert was fabulous as well....a trio of delightful sweet flavors (see pic).\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jw-marriott-desert-ridge-resort-and-spa-phoenix-phoenix?select=JLPvffOfpIzZIX8pC2QRjQ#JLPvffOfpIzZIX8pC2QRjQ\u000a\u000aThe ballroom stage was amazing and the entertainment, featuring J-Lo, Billy Ray Cyrus, Billy Crystal, Steve Martin, Reba, and many more was awesome.  Their banquet staff deserves the 5 Stars on this review.\u000a\u000aI've never stayed in the hotel, but will give it a try for a staycation in the future.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

We always wonder why we wasted our time downtown.  \u000a\u000aThis is another place that's seen better days.....once known as the Union Plaza, the new owners have remodeled it....somewhat.  For that they earn a Star and kept them out of my 2 Star review list.  What they can't escape is father time and a building infrastructure that will only hold them back.....please stop remodeling and implode and build something new, that's how Vegas reinvents itself.\u000a\u000aNot worth a trip downtown.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 15%

The entrance is not in a high traffic area....I hope they can stay open with this handicap.\u000a\u000aIt's a 2 level restaurant with the main dining room on the 1st floor and the lounge with live entertainment on the 2nd floor.  We opted to dine on the 2nd floor and listen to the entertainer....he was a one man show playing a keyboard and singing jazz tunes...he was ok.\u000a\u000aAfter browsing the menu, we opted for:\u000a\u000aWedge Salad, $8\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bobbys-restaurant-and-jazz-lounge-scottsdale-2?select=RE9cSGRSgIMWiINEvBDuyw#RE9cSGRSgIMWiINEvBDuyw\u000a\u000aEscargot, $12.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bobbys-restaurant-and-jazz-lounge-scottsdale-2?select=exaKPAULLoKK3UiMswa45g#exaKPAULLoKK3UiMswa45g\u000a\u000aGnocchi & Veal Meatballs, $19.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bobbys-restaurant-and-jazz-lounge-scottsdale-2?select=jEw_PDJRRRaxT87FNMBGIg#jEw_PDJRRRaxT87FNMBGIg\u000a\u000aDuckling (Half Bone-In, Wild Rice, Vegetables), $25.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bobbys-restaurant-and-jazz-lounge-scottsdale-2?select=rJOCFs1iVgbyUMSgQBpdeA#rJOCFs1iVgbyUMSgQBpdeA\u000a\u000aTiramisu\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bobbys-restaurant-and-jazz-lounge-scottsdale-2?select=Gvhvnst10z0y1-UeO22Ntg#Gvhvnst10z0y1-UeO22Ntg\u000a\u000aAlmond Cake\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bobbys-restaurant-and-jazz-lounge-scottsdale-2?select=5xbnXGSOc6Ly-rnw7rRV1Q#5xbnXGSOc6Ly-rnw7rRV1Q\u000a\u000aI love Wedge Salad....and they do it well here...it was very good.

VThis place is straight out of Bizarro World....I mean it's super cool, yet kind of creepy.  If you've ever seen the movie The Dark Backward you'd know what I'm talking about.....or even House of a 1000 Corpses....it's just strange, but so cool you don't want to leave.\u000a\u000aThere are dozens of pinball machines dating from the mid 1900's to now.  What I love are the Old School 1970's & 1980's Original Video games like Donkey Kong, Paperboy, Defender, Spy Hunter, Space Invaders....you get the picture.  It was like I was 10 yrs old again.\u000a\u000aNow for the creepy stuff.  There is a Clown Puppet Carnival game where you put in a quarter and you can control it's arms & legs.  It is soooo weird and looks like a prop from a 1980's Horror Flick.  I posted a YouTube Video of this crazy thing in action here:\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H5x-rANb10\u000a\u000aThen there is another creepy game with a Dollface Baseball Player (see pics)....it was made in 1967 and was in Circus Circus when it first opened.  The other creepy thing about this place is that it seems like nobody works here....I swear I couldn't find an attendant anywhere.....yet you could see tools & out of order games in the back where they are working.  The games are housed in an empty building with absolutely no decor or anything.....and it's really really dark in there.....only the sunlight & light from the games to keep it lit up.  Strange. ~Cue Twilight Zone Music~  I was waiting to see Rod Sterling in the corner of the room staring at me.\u000a\u000aThis is a must see in my book.\u000a\u000aWill I come back?  The next time I'm in the Twilight Zone....of course!

VBuffet of Buffets Marathon - Stop #5 of 7 3:00 PM\u000a\u000aAfter 4 buffets in the past 5 hours, there was a part of me that wanted to quit at this point and just drive home.  Realizing how stupid that would be, I decided to press on and head over to the Rio for Stop #5 on the Buffet of Buffets Marathon.\u000a\u000aOnce again, when our group was seated we took a few minutes to pause and gain the strength to go after another round of food.\u000a\u000aThis buffet is one of the largest out of the 7 on the list and there was plenty to choose from.  Since I'm not eating Meat right now, I narrowed down my choice to a Cheese Enchilada, Chimichanga, Slice of Pizza, Quesadilla, and a Churro.  All were very, very good.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw?select=fQjaJZ3bmRecEo0iZHEebQ\u000a\u000aIf I had any more room in my stomach, I would have sampled more dishes, but I just couldn't muster the strength.  Here are some samples of what was available:\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw?select=9MYQJhB3J2xaVciDcqzodw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw?select=TNoxBrLpe1HUqOCO6WdiWg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw?select=GmIOlUaUWPeK3QDpaZeIog\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw?select=dAElVFwveZIns7Jt_3FhyQ\u000a\u000aOverall, the service was the best here.  Our server brought us out some Champagne and was quick with the refills and clearing of the table.  The food selection here is awesome too.....as well as the quality.  A 5 Star buffet for sure.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VA couple of colleagues and I dropped in one night after work for a bite to eat.  We sat outside on the patio.  It was around 6:30 pm and the place was packed.  I ordered:\u000a\u000aGuacamole & Chips, $10\u000aGreen Chile Burger (Poblano Chili, Cheddar Cheese, Chipotle Aoli), $13\u000a\u000aThe Guacamole was very good.  Much better than I expected.  The Green Chile Burger was awesome.  The bitter taste of the Peppers went well with the juicy Burger and melted Cheese....also, the Chipotle Aoli gave it a smooth finish and nice kick.\u000a\u000aService here was very good.  Our server was attentive and kept our Wine glasses full.  Can't wait to come back and try more items.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VI've lived in Las Vegas since 1993 and have seen many shows.  My wife and I had the opportunity to see Le Reve recently and I was blown away.  The centrally located stage was amazing.  The acrobatic performers were mesmerizing.  I thought the music and choreography were excellent as well.\u000a\u000aWe sat 5 rows from the action and I don't think it was any better or worse than other seats in the theater.  The seats were very comfortable and you had plenty of room.  If your are taller, you may have a slight issue with leg room, but that's pretty standard for Vegas showrooms.\u000a\u000aI highly recommend this show to people visiting Vegas.

VOne of my favorite shows in Vegas.  This show combines acrobatic moves with high dives and water choreographed moves.\u000a\u000aSimilar to Cirque shows, this show features a ton of amazing acrobats who's skills amaze me every time.  The room is circular and the stage in the center of the room rotates so that there really isn't a bad seat in the house.\u000a\u000aAs usual, I didn't understand the story line of the show....I paid attention to the flips & dives and crazy one handed balancing acts.  If it wasn't for that kind of action, I'd probably fall asleep.  The colors and use of the entire room as a stage is pretty amazing too!\u000a\u000aThe only downside to this show is that the Garth Brooks theater is right next to it and can get congested before showtime.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet I will, it's in my Top 5!

VOnce upon a time this was my favorite outlet mall.  However, in recent years it has gone downhill so I've been going to the Premium Outlet Mall in Downtown Las Vegas.  However, this Christmas shopping season I decided to stop by and do some shopping here since it was raining and the other mall is an outdoor mall.\u000a\u000aThis mall is going under construction, which is a good thing because it needs a facelift.  Despite the slight inconvenience of the renovation, the shopping experience was pretty good.  I stopped by some old favorite stores that were still there and found a couple of new stores.  I'm glad I stopped by.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Definitely after the renovation is complete.

VThis mall is huge.  It's been around for almost 20 yrs now and has continued to expand and add stores even through the economic downturn.  We travel to Vegas once a year in December to go to the NFR and do some Christmas shopping. This place is on our list to visit when we do.\u000a\u000aThe majority of the stores are indoor with a few outdoor stores in the parking lot.  If you plan to shop/browse the entire mall, plan on an all day shopping excursion.  It will take a while to casually go through it all.\u000a\u000aIf you get hungry, there's a food court in the center of the mall with fast food options or you can dine in some sit-down restaurants in the parking lot.\u000a\u000aI've found some great deals at the stores here and if you catch them at the right time you'll the sales/discounts can be huge.  Be prepared for large crowds on the weekends and if you're driving here I recommend parking on the South side of the mall where I've found it to be less busy and easier to park.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VI was at the Mirage today for a trade show and decided to finally give this joint a try.  I should have known better when I saw that you had to be seated by a hostess.....what Deli seats you with a hostess?  Seriously?\u000a\u000aAnyway, I asked to be seated and she sat me at a two top table that had place settings, but the table was still dirty with small pieces of pickle on the table....gross.\u000a\u000aAfter browsing the menu, I almost left.  The prices were ridiculous!  I decided to stick it out and be a trooper and give the place a chance.  I ordered a $15.99 Hot Pastrami Sandwich on Rye Bread.....that's right folks.....that's not a typo....$15.99 for a Hot Pastrami Sandwich and it doesn't come with Chips or Fries.....FREE pickles though, which tasted pretty good.\u000a\u000aTo wash it down, I ordered an Iced Tea and Water.....the server didn't leave me any straws (I hate that by the way).....yet every other table around me had straws.....and I watched....nobody asked for them, they were just given to them by their server.  Maybe my server was having an off day....I don't know.\u000a\u000aThe food came out pretty fast.  The Pastrami Sandwich is your typical New York Style.......5 inches of meat that's impossible to put in your mouth.  Since my name isn't Joey Chestnut (Google him), I took a fork and pulled 20% of it out so that I could eat it like a normal person.\u000a\u000aBesides the complimentary Pickles that were awesome, the other thing that saved this joint from a 1 Star was the Deli Mustard on the table.....man was it awesome!  I doused each bit with this Mustard....which made the sandwich edible because the Pastrami was dried out and too chewy.  Also, the crust of the Rye Bread was tough....had a Beef Jerky texture to it.....what?  I've never had Rye Bread like that......maybe it's normal, but not in my book.\u000a\u000aI forced myself to finish it because I didn't want my $25 meal (Iced Tea was $3.50 for glass, plus tax and gratuity) to go to waste.  I'm not a cheapskate, but damn I can have some great meals for $25.\u000a\u000aWill I come back?  Not unless you're paying the bill.

VI've rented cars a few times from this location.  It's one of the most efficient Enterprise rental locations I've seen.  You check in at the counter on the main level, then go down the escalator to pick up your car.  I like how the employees greet you when you get off the escalator then escort you to a variety of cars for you to select.  \u000a\u000aOn two recent road trips I drove a new Toyota Camry and a new Nissan Altima.  The Camry drove really well and had paddle shifts on the wheel, which gave me something to play with during the trip.\u000a\u000aOverall, I've had a very good experience with this rental location.  It's definitely at the top of my list when considering renting a car.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 91%

VMy Son and I enjoy coming here once a year for Fright Dome, which is when they turn the entire theme park into a haunted theme park.  There are several haunted experiences and they offer a fast pass, which can get you in/out of all of the attractions quickly....well worth the extra $30 or so.\u000a\u000aOther than that, we don't come here.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Only during Halloween season.

VThe Wife and I decided to treat ourselves to a nice dinner in a relaxed environment and she suggested we dine at Verandah.  Located in the Four Seasons @ Mandalay Bay, this restaurant is a great getaway where you don't feel like you're on the Las Vegas Strip.\u000a\u000aAfter browsing the menu, we decided to order:\u000a\u000aSalad\u000aCaprese - Beefsteak Tomato, Campania Buffalo Mozzarella, Pesto\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ?select=KdUUseaYZ5I3jPuDCwhiWA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ?select=FacNkTHkUVooJuqELmZs-g\u000aAragosta - Lobster, Frisee, Seasonal Vegetables, Truffle Vinaigrette\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ?select=3OCmQkKjb43sK0JY_bC66w\u000a\u000aEntrees\u000aPenne Alla Arrabiata - Smoked Mozzarella, Spicy Roma Tomato Sauce\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ?select=aAoVdVRd0bvfZj5BTwEelA\u000aBranzino - Striped Sea Bass, Citrus Crust, Fennel Sauce\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ?select=ccVqY3Qp-e3rdsqZ1Gflzw\u000a\u000aSide Dishes\u000aBaby Potatoes with Black Truffle\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ?select=YeSoCAR3VCJwQ04tndVcYw\u000aMushrooms with Marsala\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ?select=aQOaL6HcE3oGygKjOvxmyw\u000a\u000aFor Dessert\u000aWarm Italian Donuts, Lemon Curd, Chocolate Ganache\u000a\u000aI had the Caprese Salad and the Penne Alla Arrabiata.

The Caprese Salad was not overdone with Oil, unlike some restaurants.\u000a\u000aThe Wife enjoyed her Lobster Salad and Striped Bass.  She passed on Dessert, but I couldn't resist the Warm Italian Doughnuts, so I went for it.....they were so good, I forgot to take a picture of them and they were gone by the time I remembered....:)\u000a\u000aThe service was impeccable.

VStopped by this place to meet up with colleagues for a glass of wine or two.  I didn't eat here, so this review is somewhat incomplete.\u000a\u000aThe wine selection was pretty good, but I thought it was expensive.  The servers were very nice, but they were very clumsy.  In the 2 hours I was there, the bartender spilled a drink he was preparing all over the bar and almost spilled it on me.....then he dropped a dish and it broke all over the floor.  This happened with 5 people in the bar....not like he was distracted by all of the business....ha!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Probably not....unless a friend or colleague makes me.

VPopped in for some lunch with old friends.  After browsing the menu, I decided to go for the Trio of Sliders, which are 3 Sliders (BBQ Bacon, Mushrooms, and Regular).  It comes with a small side order of Fries.  Since I wasn't paying for lunch, I forgot to get the price.....I think it's around $9.\u000a\u000aThe food came out after a short wait.  The Sliders were OK.  My favorite was the BBQ Bacon Slider.  The other two weren't that great.  The Fries were just OK.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a nice lunch with friends.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

Most restaurants outside the airport charge that much for 3 Sliders.....deal!  The Sliders were average.....I've had better.  Of course, the Dos XX was tasty and refreshing....ahhh!\u000a\u000aThis place can get pretty packed and it's difficult to bring large carry on bags in here, so be wary.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VTime for a review update.  Whenever I'm flying out of the C Gates, the first place I go to hangout and way for my flight is this restaurant.  Why?  Because as I pointed out in my prior review, the food is relatively cheap for being located at an airport.  Over the years I've lived in Phoenix, this has become my go to place and it rarely disappoints.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VThe Better Half and I decided to give this joint a try.  We'd heard about it and saw the favorable reviews on Yelp.  Unfortunately, the experience didn't match our expectations.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a- The waiter took forever to take our drink order....we seriously could have drank a glass of Wine in the amount of time it took him to come by.  One thing I hate is having to wait for my Wine!\u000a\u000a- He screwed up our order and forgot my side order of Bacon Fried Rice.  I was looking forward to trying it because it sounded sooo good.  But when it didn't come out with the entrees, I didn't want to have to eat it by itself.\u000a\u000a- The serving of the Salad was mistimed and the entrees came out before we were finished with our Salad and Appetizers.....we felt rushed.\u000a\u000aWe ordered:\u000a\u000aSONOMA FOIE GRAS\u000aCHERRY PRESERVE, $25\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A?select=2VpoayF-8SBISGf7cIwHpw\u000a\u000aPECORINO GNOCCHI\u000aSACRAMENTO DELTA ASPARAGUS.

I tried a bit of TBH's Pad Thai, and it was pretty good.\u000a\u000aOverall, the food was great, but the service sucked.

VI've never watched a Cardinals game here.  However, I've watched 2 Fiesta Bowls and been to several gun shows here.  I really like this place, especially for the Fiesta Bowl.  The place is packed to the gills and it doesn't feel uncomfortable.\u000a\u000aTailgating on the lawn area for the Fiesta Bowl is fun too.  There's 2 major tailgates and plenty of room to accommodate the thousands of people coming to party.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/university-of-phoenix-stadium-glendale?select=T7Cv3Jf8nJnHPTaqL6xFxQ#T7Cv3Jf8nJnHPTaqL6xFxQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/university-of-phoenix-stadium-glendale?select=CIpTXYER1dK2pTXzK8ts3Q#CIpTXYER1dK2pTXzK8ts3Q\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/university-of-phoenix-stadium-glendale?select=JnGPF38ZiFa778fua5p4tQ#JnGPF38ZiFa778fua5p4tQ\u000a\u000aThe private suites are very spacious and nice with ample seating and have great views of the field.

VLooking for a place to eat, we stumbled across this joint.  What a great surprise!\u000a\u000aThe restaurant is located on the sublevel floor of the hotel, below the lobby.  It's kind of hidden and difficult to find if you're unfamiliar with the place....but worth looking for.  The stairwell is lit with candles...I wonder how long it takes to light all of those every day?  Ha!\u000a\u000aThey serve you this Bread that must come from Heaven because it's so awesome!  The only bad part is that the Butter comes out cold and hard....why do restaurants do that?!  It's such a pain to spread it on the Bread.....it was awesome nevertheless.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=2eQrsJcdON3yV2NWBPJq5w#2eQrsJcdON3yV2NWBPJq5w\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=nhgW17m3ur1K6_t2ewSXRQ#nhgW17m3ur1K6_t2ewSXRQ\u000a\u000aFor appetizers, we had the Kobe Beef Tenderloin Flatbread, $12.  It was very good and raw.....the server didn't tell us it was raw and neither did the menu (see pics below).  Good thing we didn't mind, but consider yourself warned.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=0hM9bfms7OIUO2zP98tL1w#0hM9bfms7OIUO2zP98tL1w\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=4bqUF6UcLnJTWSHAIVRFpQ#4bqUF6UcLnJTWSHAIVRFpQ\u000a\u000aThe Better Half had the Lump Crab, $14 and I had the Annatto Pollo Asado (Jidori Chicken), $27.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=Zp0dRqvTPsRo-B1FmjLXvQ#Zp0dRqvTPsRo-B1FmjLXvQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=0tOnd6OKDEW3P7U6Osq8Ew#0tOnd6OKDEW3P7U6Osq8Ew\u000a\u000aFor a side dish, we both split a Calabzitas Con Queso (Squash & Oaxaca Cheese), $6.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=0o4t4YI1Gd10sO4wnhCerA#0o4t4YI1Gd10sO4wnhCerA\u000a\u000aThe Jidori Chicken is full of flavor and comes with some Pasta, so it's very filling.  The Squash & Cheese was good, but I thought was a little runny.  Very different flavors for your palette here.\u000a\u000aThe service was outstanding and the room is very elegant and romantic.  We washed it down with a bottle of Cabernet of course....yum!\u000a\u000aI'm glad we found this place, can't wait to return.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 99%

VCowboy Up!!!  This is a really fun country/western club that we like to visit when we're in Vegas.  I still miss the old location inside the old Frontier....but those days are long gone.  This one isn't bad, but I don't like the entrance when it's crowded.  It's really difficult to get through the crowd, especially if you want to get to the other side, which has more tables and seats.\u000a\u000aThe night we went, there was a good band playing and plenty of people out on the dance floor.  I've never tried the food here.  Too many choices to eat in Vegas.  This place is strictly for partying for us.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VWas in the area and decided to stop by for lunch.  It's a small, casual dining restaurant with seating for about 20 people.  It has a small salsa bar, which is always a plus to me.\u000a\u000aAfter browsing the menu for a while, I decided to order a Carne Asada Burrito ($5.25) and a Carnitas Taco ($2.65).  I asked the guy taking my order if they had a spicier Salsa than what they had on the Salsa Bar.  To my surprise, he said they had a Habanero Salsa that they make in the kitchen but it has to be a special request because it's that hot.....perfect!  I asked for a side of that too.\u000a\u000aAfter a few minutes, it was ready and I picked up my order from the counter.  The Burrito was huge!  I eagerly took a bite with a little Habanero Salsa.....yum!  Very tasty and spicy!  The Carne Asada had a good flavor to it and was slightly dry, but that's ok with me.  There was a good ratio of Guacamole and Beans in the Burrito and the Tortilla held up well.....it didn't fall apart, which I don't enjoy.\u000a\u000aThe Carnitas Taco was just OK.  I thought the Carnitas lacked flavor.  I won't order this next time.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a good meal.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet.

VAnother golf course I've been coming to since I moved here in '93.  Unfortunately, this golf course has seen better days.  It's run down and quickly becoming one of my least favorite golf courses in Vegas.  Here's why:\u000a\u000aPROS\u000a- Large practice facility w/lights.  They renovated their driving range a couple of years ago and added a lot more practice mats and an area for their school.  The lights are a huge plus because you can go there at night.  Info on costs:\u000aSmall Basket (25 Balls)  $3\u000aMedium Basket (55 Balls)  $6\u000aLarge Basket (100 Balls)  $10\u000a\u000a- The Par 3 course.  Besides the two 18 hole standard golf courses (Palm/Mountain), there is a Par 3 course that has lights and you can play golf at night.  They have golf leagues that you can participate in on some nights.\u000a\u000a- Putting course.  There's also a small putting course....great for kids.  It's on real grass and not like those putt-putt fake courses with windmills....this is more similar to a real putting green.\u000a\u000a- Convenient location.  It's across the street from the Suncoast and Rampart casinos.....off the Summerlin Pkwy & Rampart exit.\u000a\u000a- Annual golf discount card.  You can purchase a discount card which is good for the year and comes with free rounds, practice time, and tournament entries....plus discounts off of green fees.\u000a\u000aCONS\u000a- The greens are terrible.  This golf course doesn't keep their greens in good shape.  9 times out of 10, it's in horrible condition.  A large factor is that they run so many people through the golf course and many of them are rookies who never played the game and have no respect or course etiquette....which leads me to.....\u000a\u000a- This course is full of newbies and rude players.  For some reason they are attracted to this course....maybe it's because of the annual golf discount card that you can get that comes with free rounds and discounted green fees.....whatever it is, people ruin the greens with their spikes or fail to fix their ball marks....both of which contribute to terrible green conditions.\u000a\u000a- They jam in too many people on the tee times.  They overbook this course.....on busy days, you'll be waiting on tee boxes and getting hit into because the course is so damn crowded.  They pack people in like sardines.  It's agonizing playing on those days....I avoid like the plague.\u000a\u000aOverall, I've lost interest in playing here.....however, The Better Half and my Son enjoy it because of the Par 3 course and the large range.  We come here often to practice and once or twice a year I will play a round here because a buddy of mine will insist on it.....played here last month, blech....but as they say, "A bad day of golf beats a good day without golf"...ha!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Despite the 2 Star rating, I know I'll be back.

VThis is the closest location to our house, so when we're in the mood for PF Changs, this is our spot.  We have our fav dishes here:\u000a\u000aTofu Lettuce Wraps\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p-f-changs-china-bistro-scottsdale?select=lTmGIEKaeJusWJtgYcXPfg#lTmGIEKaeJusWJtgYcXPfg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p-f-changs-china-bistro-scottsdale?select=QmpwvGbfbA0WnCorx5mJng#QmpwvGbfbA0WnCorx5mJng\u000a\u000aDali Chicken\u000a\u000aTofu Pad Thai\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p-f-changs-china-bistro-scottsdale?select=aYtcX1h_FTZ7Fl4ugE8abw#aYtcX1h_FTZ7Fl4ugE8abw\u000a\u000aWe like the unique flavor of PF Changs, but it's not on our regular rotation of restaurants anymore.  We only come by when we get the urge to have one of their signature dishes like the Dali Chicken or Tofu Lettuce Wraps.  The food tastes the same, but I think they've cut down on their portion size over the past few years while keeping prices the same.....sneaky.  For instance, with the Lettuce Wraps, we only got 3 small Lettuce leaves with the order.  In the past, we'd get 1/2 a head of Lettuce with large leaves.  Also, I remember when we would be able to share entrees and eat family style.  Now, it's not really possible.\u000a\u000aThe service here is hit & miss.  The last visit, we had to waive down our server for everything.....refill water glasses, order more Wine, WTH?!  However, the 2 visits before that our server was attentive.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VWe found this place because several people wanted to get together before our sons' football game for a little happy hour pre-party....otherwise, there's no way I'd stumble across this joint.  It's located in the middle of Phoenix somewhere and is a pretty cool bar/restaurant.  I saddled up to the bar and ordered an IPA to get started on Happy Hour and then we ordered these items for $5 each (happy hour pricing):\u000a\u000a1/2 Medium, 1/2 Sweet BBQ Wings\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/half-moon-sports-grill-phoenix-2?select=YXKrnuDpFyhAm2af4eTg5g#YXKrnuDpFyhAm2af4eTg5g\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/half-moon-sports-grill-phoenix-2?select=Yj_9ysSNU7HcjcCiovTYqQ#Yj_9ysSNU7HcjcCiovTYqQ\u000a\u000aSausage & Pepperoni Pizza\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/half-moon-sports-grill-phoenix-2?select=8ehj7xtOySrjAzCV8S0PaA#8ehj7xtOySrjAzCV8S0PaA\u000a\u000aAt the recommendation of the bartender, we split between the Medium and Sweet BBQ Wings....he was spot on...both were awesome!  I preferred the Sweet BBQ Wings between the 2.\u000a\u000aThe Sausage and Pepperoni Pizza was good as well...not great, but good.\u000a\u000aThis place is pretty impressive.  The bar is fairly large and was busy on the night we went. They have a large patio area and could easily handle large groups.  Plenty of TV's in the bar area for sports.  There's also a large dining room area.  \u000a\u000aOverall, we had fun hanging out here for 1 night.  However, it's too far away for us to be regulars here.  But if we're in the area, this will definitely be on our list of possible joints to visit.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VCES, the largest convention in the world, features the latest and greatest electronics at the World Trade Center Las Vegas (formerly the Las Vegas Convention Center).....some of the items featured here have not hit the stores yet.  It's one of my favorite conventions to attend here in Vegas.\u000a\u000aWith over 130,000 people expected at this year's CES I was prepared to battle crowds.  It wasn't too bad though.  I parked at the Las Vegas Hilton, which charges $30 a day to park there, but it's convenient to get in/out, so it's worth it in my opinion.\u000a\u000aThe registration process was very easy.  There was no line, perfect!\u000a\u000a*TIP* - CES has a registration booth at the Las Vegas Hilton and it's not nearly as crowded as the main booth at the World Trade Center.....so come here to register.\u000a\u000aI then headed over to the North Hall of the World Trade Center which is where all of the marquee companies are located.  I walked through the automobile electronics section, which was pretty cool.....think high-end and cool car stereo and entertainment stuff.  Then I went into the main hall where companies like Samsung, Microsoft, Intel, Sony, and other giants are located.  This year 3D TV's and 3D Entertainment seem to be the dominant theme on the main floor.  This really isn't groundbreaking as 3D has been around for a while.....I guess this is the year for the big push for it.  Lack of 3D Content is the big issue for these gadgets.  I also think wearing 3D glasses is ridiculous.....there's technology already out there that doesn't require them....it seems like it's already outdated, but companies are pushing it anyway.  I predict it will be a short term solution.\u000a\u000aIn the main hall, I also saw the new Samsung tablet...a potential competitor for the iPad.  I wasn't really impressed.  It worked well and looked nice, but not a game changer in my opinion.\u000a\u000aAfter screwing around the main hall for a while, I headed over to the South Hall....I wanted to see the new Blackberry tablet, which is going to be launched soon to compete with the iPad.  I found it on the 2nd floor of the South Hall with a large crowd around the display.  After a short wait, I muscled my way to the front to get a demo of the tablet.....I was pleasantly surprised with the functionality, navigation, speed, and lightweight of the tablet.  The integration with the Blackberry phone is also impressive.  The tablet also has true multi-tasking capabilities....just like a computer, you can watch a video, surf the web, and launch another application with no hiccup in performance.  That was amazing!  In my opinion, it's not a big game-changer, but it puts Blackberry back on the map to compete with Apple and Android.  I like this product and will anxiously wait for it to come out.  I was told Sprint would be the 1st cell carrier to have it.  Can't wait! (see pic here: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ks43LokM7OWst3BJTtt-6g?select=b5ZtjUFv738j0I0Nki8ZQw )\u000a\u000aAfter this, I was tired and wanted to head back to the Hilton to attend the CES Tweetup (different review).\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a good show.....well organized and always impressive.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  No doubt about it!\u000a\u000aSome Tips:\u000a\u000a- Wear comfortable shoes.  It's a huge convention and you will do a ton of walking.\u000a\u000a- Bring a camera with a lot of memory.  There's a ton of gadgets and things to take photos of.  Don't miss out!\u000a\u000a- Be prepared to pay for parking, up to $30 a day.

VMy first visit to Hash House A Go Go was for a CMYE event, so I couldn't officially review it.  My second visit was a simple breakfast with The Better Half (TBH).\u000a\u000aI ordered the Chorizo Hash (Chorizo, Jalapeno, Cheddar Cheese, Potatoes, Eggs, Biscuit, Peppers & Onions).  TBH ordered the Salmon Benedict.  To wash it down, I had the Mango/Peach Iced Tea.\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait, the food came out.  Since we have been here before, we knew what was in store for us....a massive plate of food.  Adam Richman from Man vs Food picked a great spot to host his show.....portions are LARGE!  You have to bring your A-Game to finish your plate.\u000a\u000aMy strategy was simple....I will save the Biscuit for the end.  Biscuits are stomach busters.  I added some Tabasco and dove into the Chorizo Hash & Eggs.  It was very good!  The combination of ingredients had a good flavor to it.  The saltiness of the Chorizo combined with the gooey Cheddar Cheese and hot Potatoes made for a huge plate of Awesome!  I wish there were more Jalapenos on it though....it didn't seem to have enough of them.....kind of light.  The Eggs were prepared Over Easy just the way I like it....with the runny Egg Yolk covering the Hash when I broke the seal.  As I said, the Biscuit was last and I ate most of it with the final third of my dish....it was puffy & buttery....delicious and filling.\u000a\u000aTBH enjoyed her Salmon Benedict, but could only manage to finish 1/2 the plate.  I packed up the other half for later.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a great experience, just like the first time.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Soon....very soon!

VWent to dinner with the Better Half at the Top of the World Restaurant.  I've been there for lunch many times, but have never been for dinner.\u000a\u000aWe were seated at a table along the edge of the restaurant, which had a perfect, unobstructed view of the valley.  Since our reservations were for 6:30 pm in the 1st week of April, we knew we were going to get a great view of the sunset.\u000a\u000aThe waitress was very friendly and told us to take our time.  Here's a brief summary of our experience:\u000a\u000aWine - We ordered a bottle of 2006 Scott Harvey Zinfandel.  It had a nice bite to it....hints of blackberry and pepper made it robust....yum!\u000a\u000aAppetizer - Portobello Mushroom, Red Pepper, and Buffalo Mozzarella in Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar......one of our favorites.  Very good.\u000a\u000aEntree - Lobster Tail stuffed with Crab meat.  Prime New York Strip with peppercorn crust.  Very, very good.  The meat was cooked just right.\u000a\u000aSide Dishes - Sides are ordered separately here.  We had Foie Gras, Risotto Gnocchi with Cheese, and Au Gratin Potatoes with Cheese.  The Au Gratin were a little overcooked, but the rest of them were fantastic!\u000a\u000aDessert - They offered small desserts, which is perfect because I really hate large dessert dishes.  I think they're a waste of money and food.\u000a\u000aThe Better Half had a chocolate something or other...can't remember right now (Thank you Scott Harvey!) ...I had the strawberry cheesecake lollipops and the cookies & cream lollipops....with dipping sauce and crumbled cookies....yes, they are as good as it sounds.  Check out the photos above to see them.\u000a\u000aService - We were treated well from start to finish.  We had to ask for water a few times but that was the only strike against a perfect evening.\u000a\u000aI would have scored the restaurant 5 stars, but I felt that the menu was lacking more vegetarian options.  At the time of this visit I was trying to avoid eating meat....not go vegetarian, but just avoid it for a while.  There was only a grilled vegetable option, which sounded "blah" to me....so I broke my diet and went for the Prime NY Strip.\u000a\u000aWould I visit this place again?  Absolutely!  Awesome place to take your significant other and spend a romantic evening overlooking the Vegas Valley.

VAfter 35+ yrs, I finally decided to give Sushi a try.  I told The Better Half (TBH) that I wanted to give it a shot and she suggested we come here so that I can have a good selection to choose from.  I don't eat Seatfood and have never had raw Fish until now.  TBH and my friends all love Sushi and I kind of feel bad when we have to make different plans because of me....so, here we are.\u000a\u000aI was very nervous as we entered the joint and TBH was great because she didn't pressure me to try anything in particular.  I was starvin' like Marvin but my appetite suddenly disappeared as we walked in.  After getting setup with Ginger, Wasabi, Soy Sauce, Jalapeno Soy Sauce I browsed the Sushi buffet line.\u000a\u000aI decided that I was going to take it slow and only try a few things....so, I went for Tuna, Salmon, Unagi, 2 rolls I have no idea what they were, Stuffed Tempura Jalapenos, Spicy Tuna Cucumber Rice thingy, and some Tempura fried Roll thingy.  Sorry I don't know the names, but took pics so I'm sure if you're a Sushi enthusiast you'll know exactly what it is.\u000a\u000aI enjoyed the Tuna, Salmon, Unagi, & Spicy Tuna.....the other stuff I didn't care for.  I dipped it in a Soy Sauce/Wasabi mix that TBH helped me make....and it helped with the taste.  TBH told me to eat some Ginger every once in a while...which was a blast of freakin' flavor....wasn't expecting that and choked on it.  \u000a\u000aI have no idea how to base a rating on Sushi since this was my 1st time....so to me the experience was A-OK, 3 Stars.  I wish they had labels on the Sushi, they didn't.....Overall, I enjoyed myself and will eat Sushi again.  I want to give other Seafood a try now.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I think so.

VI like this mall.  It reminds me of the Spectrum in Irvine.  Some of my favorite places to shop & eat are:\u000a\u000aFatburger\u000aYard House\u000aDave and Buster's\u000a\u000aI really want to like this place more than 3 stars, but it just seems to lack that vibe that the Irvine Spectrum has.  The parking here is awful....very difficult to get in/out, especially when it's busy.  It's also has very poor signage in the parking lot, so you have to know where the stores are before you head over to this mall.\u000a\u000aOverall, the shopping experience is not bad, but I've had better.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VThis place is old and needs to be imploded.  It looks like it was built in the 1960's or 70's and hasn't had a facelift since.  They need to improve the "Ring of Honor" photo displays in the arena....right now, it looks like a high school yearbook from 1965 instead of a modern display to honor the ASU Hall of Fame athletes who deserve to be honored in a better way.  It's more hilarious than honorable.  They did a good job at the football stadium, some Alumni should step up to make it happen here.\u000a\u000aThe walkways to get to your seat are very narrow so when people are in line at the concession stands it's very difficult to walk around.  Same thing if a line forms at the restrooms, it's difficult to walk by.\u000a\u000aThe seats in the arena are very narrow too.  I have no idea how anyone who weighs 250+ lbs can sit in them.  \u000a\u000aThe video board is not bad and it can get loud when it's full, which is a key to home team advantage.\u000a\u000aOverall, the game watching experience is the best attribute to this arena.  It falls short on everything else.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 75%

VThe sister property of the California Hotel in Downtown Vegas, this is a nice spot to come by for eats and drinks.  Here are some highlights:\u000a\u000a- It was once known by the name of "Rosie O'Grady's Main St Station" when it was owned by Bob Snow.\u000a\u000a- It's design is very similar to it's sister property (Church St Station) that Bob Snow built in Orlando, FL.\u000a\u000a- Some of the bathrooms on the main casino floor have parts of the Berlin Wall as the wall of the bathroom.\u000a\u000a- It is one of the most unique designs in Las Vegas.\u000a\u000a- FREE Parking in the parking garage & valet.\u000a\u000a- There are a couple of antique Snooker Tables on the 2nd floor, which isn't open to the public, but is on the way to the management offices.\u000a\u000aI like to come here to have lunch and have drinks at the Triple 7 Brewpub (separate review).  The casino is relatively small by Vegas standards, but average sized by Downtown standards.  The rooms are basic hotel rooms.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Of course....it's one of my favorite places Downtown.

VMy co-workers and I enjoy going to the Triple 7 Microbrewery for lunch.  It is a hidden gem in downtown Las Vegas, located at Main St Station.\u000a\u000aThe food is bar food...pizzas, sandwiches, appetizers, etc.\u000a\u000aSome of my favorite dishes are:\u000a\u000a- Focaccia vegetable sandwich.\u000a- Chicken Philly Sandwich\u000a- Pizza\u000a- Burgers\u000a\u000aThe beer is really good too.  Can't remember the names of the ones I enjoy...will try to next time.\u000a\u000aWill I go back?  Absolutely.  Why only 3 Stars?  Because of the location...if it wasn't downtown, I'd give it 4 Stars.

VHad a working lunch meeting here last week.  I had my favorite dish, the Chicken Philly Sandwich w/Salsa Ranch on the side and Fries.  It was as good as the last time I was here.  We arrived when they opened at 11 am to beat the lunch rush and to have some quiet time to meet.  Everything worked out perfect and ran into a few old friends while I was there.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet.

VLiving in Las Vegas for over 17 years, one of the top questions I get asked every year is "Where is the best place to watch Football and bet on sports?".....the answer i always give them is the Las Vegas Hilton Sportsbook.  Here's why:\u000a\u000aPROS\u000a- It's the World's Largest Race & Sportsbook....."So What?"  Well, that means there are plenty of betting windows, you can bet on almost anything....seriously, World Cup Soccer, Rugby, and many other odd bets you can't find anywhere else in town.\u000a\u000a- Their Super Bowl proposition bets....this joint is known for their prop bets.  The number of prop bets is literally over 25 pages front & back!  You can get on stuff like.....who will score more points?  Kobe Bryant? or the total of the Super Bowl for both teams?\u000a\u000a- Easy access.....the sportsbook is located at the rear of the Hilton.  There is a parking lot back there that you can easily walk in, make your bet and walk back out to your car.  Most sportsbooks are a long walk to/from the parking lot.\u000a\u000a- Plenty of seats.....have you noticed how very few seats there are in most sportsbooks?  Not here....there are hundreds of seats throughout the book.\u000a\u000a- Football Central.....ahh, my favorite part of this place.  Every NFL season, they have a FREE NFL football party located inside the Hilton Theater, which acts like an extension of the sportsbook.  There are huge Hi-Def screens that show every single NFL game at one time....yes, you can watch all of them at once!  The best part?  You can find seats!  Because it's in the theater, there are over 1,000 seats in the lower level plus another 400 or so up in the balcony.  I like to bring large groups of friends here because we can always find seats and they are comfortable theater seats too!  Also, $1 Hot Dogs, $2 16 oz beers....and other food for $3-$7.  You can't beat this football party!  I did a search on Google and found this YouTube video that shows it well:\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJCiy308TdQ\u000a\u000a- Location.....the Hilton is located in the center of the city, next to the convention center....so it's easy to get people from around the city to come together because it's the same drive for everyone.\u000a\u000aCONS\u000a- I seriously can't think of any.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet! (no pun intended)

VAfter all these years, this place is still the best place to make a sports bet in Vegas.  It's still the world's largest sports book and they continue to deliver the most complete set of proposition bets for the Super Bowl in the city of Las Vegas.\u000a\u000aEvery year, I look forward to the Super Bowl propositions coming out so that I can grab a copy and sift through the hundreds of options for betting.  Despite moving out of the State, I make a pilgrimage to Vegas to bet on the Super Bowl and this is my stop.\u000a\u000aSince I don't live here anymore, I don't hang out and watch games in the book, but they still have the giant screens and plenty of seating.  I send my friends here when they come to Vegas and want to bet sports.  Keep it up guys!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VMet some friends here for drinks and to hang out for a bit.  The joint is tucked away on the 2nd floor of Harrah's in the back near the entrance to the Monorail.  It's too small to be a club.....about 1/2 the size of Gilley's.  \u000a\u000aThe food here is OK bar food.  Our friends ordered some Wings and I sampled a few....they weren't bad, just OK.  Same goes for the Fries.  Since I didn't pay, I didn't catch the price.\u000a\u000aThe waitresses are supposed to be cute/hot....but only 1/2 of them were.  The others looked a little "sloppy".  I hate saying that, but if you're going to put your staff in sexy outfits, I'd make sure they are able to meet high standards....especially in Vegas.\u000a\u000aOverall, the food/experience was just OK.  The best part is the music.  The joint feels very 'touristy'.  I'd give it another chance under the right circumstances.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VI'm a big fan of the Signature @ MGM Grand.  The Better Half and I spent a few days here and absolutely loved it.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a- Large whirlpool tubs with jets.  Very relaxing, nice touch.\u000a\u000a- Balcony facing the Strip.  There aren't too many places in Vegas with a balcony.  We were on the 23rd floor and had a great view of the Strip.\u000a\u000a- Comfortable bed.  We slept well during our entire stay.\u000a\u000a- Kitchenette.  We didn't use it, but it is a nice amenity to have.\u000a\u000a- Privacy.  These towers are not attached to the MGM Grand.  There is a long walkway that connects it to the property.  Each tower has it's own swimming pool and there is a small lounge in the Tower we stayed in, which was the center tower.  There is also a private valet entrance for each tower.\u000a\u000a- 1st class treatment.  We were treated well by every employee.  They helped make our stay pleasant.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VWalking through the Paris hotel & casino, The Better Half all of a sudden had a craving for dessert.  I think the large displays of pastries and sweet smell in the air from this joint had something to do with it.   Whatever it was, it worked on her.....we "had" to stop and wait in a long line so she could satisfy her craving...LOL.\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait, we went through the line and she had a large slice of Chocolate Cake.  We sat in the common eating area and people watched while she enjoyed her Cake.  This is located by a very busy walkway, so the people watching is great.  There's nothing like watching people late at night in Vegas....it's a show all by itself, ha!\u000a\u000aThe desserts here are awesome....next time, I want to try a slice of Pizza.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

It had a nice Garlicky kick to it and the Sauce was very light.....delish!\u000a\u000aI had an Iced Tea to wash it down and it was very refreshing....I must have drank 5 or 6 glasses.

VIt was 10:30 pm on a Tue night and after a few drinks at a nearby bar, I was getting a little hungry....so I jumped on Yelp and looked for a nearby place to grab some grub.  I found this Sandwich shop and walked a couple of blocks to check it out.\u000a\u000aAfter looking at the menu for a minute, I decided that I wanted a Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich w/Whiz & Jalapenos.  After waiting a few minutes, they brought out my Sandwich.  The Sandwich had a ton of Whiz on it, which is great....but it was light on the Meat.  Usually, places put too much meat on their Steak Sandwiches...not here.  I know Jalapenos isn't part of a traditional Steak Sandwich....and my friends from Philly would've killed me for ordering it that way, but I couldn't help myself....I love to spice it up a bit!\u000a\u000aThe Jalapenos were pretty spicy and added to the flavor in my opinion....good proportion of peppers.  The Steak was kind of bland and the bread was just ok.  I've had better Steak Sandwiches....but this did the job.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Probably not.

VI've been coming to this Sandwich shop on a regular basis for the past few years.  They're always doing Groupons and I will jump on it when they do.  The food here is ok....not the best Philly Cheesesteak that I've ever had, but it will do.\u000a\u000aSome other items we have tried here:\u000a\u000aFried Mac n Cheese\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/philadelphia-sandwich-company-scottsdale?select=VV2yC5d9549ZnhfMOU8YNA#VV2yC5d9549ZnhfMOU8YNA\u000a\u000aFries\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/philadelphia-sandwich-company-scottsdale?select=BNHY2b1YJSX3UQN6lwUJOA#BNHY2b1YJSX3UQN6lwUJOA\u000a\u000aSweet Potato Fries\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/philadelphia-sandwich-company-scottsdale?select=3tkCICkMT7V5hYs43WqyDg#3tkCICkMT7V5hYs43WqyDg\u000a\u000aOnion Rings\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/philadelphia-sandwich-company-scottsdale?select=6nJCqbEzLdPpC2PLkI3enQ#6nJCqbEzLdPpC2PLkI3enQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/philadelphia-sandwich-company-scottsdale?select=vKgaxqWI3ZKkkOwDXAQR8Q#vKgaxqWI3ZKkkOwDXAQR8Q\u000a\u000aThe Fries & Sweet Potato Fries are pretty good.

VIt's been a few years since we've dined at Terra Rossa.  We decided to come give it a try to see if we liked it as much as when we lived in Vegas.  We decided to order:\u000a\u000aAffettati (Italian Meats, Mustard, Peppadews, Arugula, Basil Tapenade, Fig preserves) $15\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/terra-rossa-las-vegas?select=yR9bkEM9PYqYwDfTWycGmg#yR9bkEM9PYqYwDfTWycGmg\u000a\u000aPasta e Fagioli, $7\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/terra-rossa-las-vegas?select=F1saafD2elzKOhagp4AoTg#F1saafD2elzKOhagp4AoTg\u000a\u000aSpaghetti Polpette (Tomato Sauce, Parmesan, Butter, Beef-Ricotta Meatballs), $18\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/terra-rossa-las-vegas?select=R5xNvIC-aq1dbR1JKCresg#R5xNvIC-aq1dbR1JKCresg\u000a\u000aTartufo E Funghi Risotto (Black Truffle, Wild Mushrooms), $29\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/terra-rossa-las-vegas?select=wDQk-F5dJuvhK0hRpNWLmQ#wDQk-F5dJuvhK0hRpNWLmQ\u000a\u000aThe Affettati appetizer was very good, but the portion is large, even for 2 people...if you decide to get it, I recommend 3 or 4 sharing unless you are eating a light entree.\u000a\u000aThe Pasta e Fagioli was awesome! I forgot how much I loved it until I took the first bite.\u000a\u000aThe Better Half had the Black Truffle and Wild Mushroom Risotto and I was lucky enough to get a few bites out of her dish....it was simply amazing!  The Black Truffle has a very sharp and distinct flavor that makes your taste buds dance for joy....yum!\u000a\u000aI had the Spaghetti Polpette, which was also good, but not as awesome as the Risotto.  The Meatballs were great and the pasta was cooked al dente, which is the right way to cook pasta....they get bonus points with me for that.\u000a\u000aService the night we were there was a bit spotty.  We had to flag our server down to get us more Wine and our check when we were ready to leave.  He was a bit inattentive.  The food made up for it though, so it gets a solid 4 Stars.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

VThe DMV has come a long way since I moved here in 1993.  The process use to take hours.....yes, that's plural hours.  Yesterday, I went in to renew my registration because I forgot and it expired 11 days ago.  I was so angry at myself this morning.\u000a\u000aI totally blew 1/2 my day because I had to get a Smog Check & I wasn't looking forward to the DMV experience.  However, my anxiety proved to be false as I was in/out of the DMV within 40 minutes.\u000a\u000aHere are some tips to ensure that your DMV experience goes well:\u000a\u000a1.  Be prepared.  Bring all of your paperwork...ie Drivers License, Proof of Insurance, Old Registration (so you can provide License Plate # or VIN number if they ask).\u000a\u000a2.  Be patient.  Even though the lines appear long, it actually goes by pretty fast.  Being impatient won't help it go any faster.  To help you relax and enjoy your time, bring your iPad or Kindle....or an old fashioned book or newspaper.\u000a\u000a3.  Get into the Information line as quickly as possible.  There is a 2 Step process for all transactions at the DMV.  Step 1 is to get in the Info line so that you can get a number.  Step 2 is to complete the transaction after your number is called.  It's pretty simple and you'll save yourself a lot of time if you understand that no matter what, there will be a minimum of 2 lines you must wait in.\u000a\u000a4.  There are Self Service Kiosks near Windows 1 & 2.\u000a\u000a5.  Bring a form of payment, Credit Card, Check, or Cash.  Believe it or not, I've watched people leave because they didn't have a way to pay their fees.....seriously.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's not a bad experience.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Not unless I have to.

VI've lived in Las Vegas since August 1993 and this is by far one of my favorite restaurants.  My fiance and I dine there at least once a month.  We discovered the place 2 years ago based on a referral from a colleague at work.  It was one of the best recommendations.  \u000a\u000aThe restaurant is located in a tough to find area if you are not familiar with Las Vegas, but it is worth the effort.  The room is small relative to most of the newer restaurants you see being built, but that is what makes the place special.  You feel like you are getting the attention you deserve.  The Executive Chef/Owner, Roberto, is always around and personally checks on you during your dinner.  The food is excellent, I would recommend the Gnocchi, Escargot, and Lamb.  Those are our personal favorites.  The wine selection is pretty good and pairs up with the meals well.  We hope everyone else enjoys it as much as we do.

VThis update is long overdue.  Was here for dinner last night with The Better Half (TBH) and four friends.  We were pleased to see many of the same familiar faces working there. We were greeted like old family members coming home for the holidays.\u000a\u000aWe started out with a bottle of Chianti before we ordered dinner.  We had all night and was enjoying the company, so our waiter ran down the Specials list and then gave us time to decide.  I ordered the Portobello Mushroom Appetizer ($9) and special ordered a Gnocchi w/Gorgonzola Sauce ($14.95)...not on the current menu, was on the old menu from a few years ago, but it's our favorite and they have no problem whipping it up.  TBH ordered the Escargot ($8.95) and the Gnocchi w/Gorgonzola Sauce ($14.95).\u000a\u000aThe Portobello Mushroom appetizer was excellent....the Mushroom was juicy and the Sauce that came with it complimented the dish well....it was a Tomato based Sauce that didn't overpower the dish.  It's a nice sized portion that can easily satisfy two people or four people with a light appetite.\u000a\u000aThe Gnocchi of course was perfect....which is why it's our favorite dish here.  The Gorgonzola Sauce was rich & creamy, but not too heavy.  The texture of the Gnocchi was just right....not too soft, which is a common mistake that many restaurants make.\u000a\u000aFor Dessert, I shared a Tiramisu ($6) with TBH and I had some Coffee....which is why I'm writing this review early in the AM.  The Tiramisu was very good......light and fluffy, just how we like it.\u000a\u000aThe service is awesome.  The server remembered us, even though it's been over 7 months since our last visit....made us feel special.  One thing about this place is that they are always willing to please their guests.  Two of our friends had special order dishes that they were more than willing to accommodate.  This was in addition to our Gnocchi order....which the server remembered how we like it and didn't ask for much direction on the order.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  There's no doubt about it.

VOnce upon a time, there were Q'doba restaurants all over the place.  Now, you have to look for them....it's like an Easter Egg Hunt trying to find one.  Luckily, the Yelp app on my iPhone found one relatively nearby.  I made the trek to seek out their Queso Steak Burrito, which is one of my favorites.  I think they put crack in their Queso Sauce.....that's the only explanation I have for wanting to drive a ways to grab something from this joint.\u000a\u000aIt didn't take long for me to finish the Queso Steak Burrito and a Side of Chips.

My friends ordered an appetizer for the table that was a Tortilla with melted Cheese on it.....they insisted that I give it a try.  I did and was instantly a fan....wow, it tasted sooo good.  The Cheese was gooey and had a nice, rich flavor.  We added some Guacamole to it and it was great.\u000a\u000aBy the time my Bean & Cheese Chimichanga came out, I was almost full from the complimentary Chips & Salsa plus the Cheesy Appetizer.  However, once I took one bite from the Chimichanga, my stomach kicked into 2nd gear.....it was good!\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a nice place to have dinner with friends.  It's very casual.....it was busy when we arrived around 7:30, but was empty by 9:00.....I can never get use to cities outside of Vegas where places empty really fast!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VOur family is a huge fan of Pin Kaow.  We were going to try Prommares, but instead chose Archi's.  \u000a\u000aFood - I had the Tofu Pad Thai (spicy level 6) and Vegetable Fried Rice.  The Pad Thai was ok.  I wasn't blown away from it and wasn't left wanting more.  I asked the server to fry the Tofu crisp and it came out soft.  They should have fried it a little bit longer.  The spice level was appropriate and enjoyable.  I felt the same way about the Fried Rice.  It was just ok.\u000a\u000aAtmosphere - The restaurant is small and the tables kind of feel on top of each other.  We prefer a more private dining experience.  We had a party of 6 people and that is probably the most I'd try to take here.  There is enough room to get larger groups in there, but it wouldn't feel comfortable in my opinion.\u000a\u000aService - The service was good.  The servers were friendly.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Probably not.....unless I'm invited there by a friend or family member.

VThis review is only for their meeting rooms and banquet facilities.  I've been to over a dozen luncheons and galas held here.  They recently opened a new ballroom area that's really impressive.  The space is large and has huge glass walls that separate the main ballroom from the pre-function space just outside.  The walls open up the ballroom in a unique way....instead of individual small doors, it creates a grand entry.  This is important because when opened, it gives your event a "grand entry" feel to it....I find that impressive.\u000a\u000aAlso, the new ballroom gives you the option to have a separate valet entrance just for your event.  Again, this can be very impressive and convenient for your guests.  As a guest of a few events that utilized this feature, I thought it was awesome.\u000a\u000aThe banquet staff here does a great job with their service of guests.  The food is always excellent.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fairmont-scottsdale-princess-scottsdale?select=Z7jE_8qF3WIf6Ad18f9Hbg#Z7jE_8qF3WIf6Ad18f9Hbg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fairmont-scottsdale-princess-scottsdale?select=N7cFBwu6HYG6os-WyAh1Vw#N7cFBwu6HYG6os-WyAh1Vw\u000a\u000aOverall, they know how to help you create and execute a solid event.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VToday was my first visit to Sunflower Market.  The Better Half (TBH) shops here all the time, but I've never joined her until today.\u000a\u000aShe had a short list of items to get, so I decided to wander around a bit.  The produce section was really amazing.  It's hard to find good, fresh produce in Vegas....we're in the middle of the desert and for some reason stores can't keep it fresh.  Well, that's not the case here....the Bell Peppers were in great shape....large, plump, ripe, and had just the right texture.  We're huge fans of Mushrooms and found the Mushroom section to be extraordinary....many of the markets in town have slimy Mushrooms which have been sitting a while....not here, they were all good!\u000a\u000aI moved on to the Salsa section....which was a little disappointing....not much of a selection here....I think I'll stick with Trader Joe's....I bought a small jar of Organic Spicy Chipotle Salsa and tried it when I got home with some homemade Nachos.....the Salsa was bland and wasn't Spicy at all....disappointing.\u000a\u000aThe Meats section was amazing here....great selection of Fresh Sausage....we didn't need any, but I will be coming back before our next Cookout at home or next Italian dinner night.\u000a\u000aTBH got her shopping list completed.....Tofu ~check~, All Natural Yogurt ~check~, Bag of Potatoes ~check~, Eggs ~check~....and a bunch of other stuff I can't remember right now.  \u000a\u000aI took a few pictures because the store was so clean and I loved their produce displays....but got scolded by an employee who said Asian business owners from other cities come here to Spy on them and steal ideas on how to setup their stores.....seriously?  Anyway, I abided by his orders and stopped taking pics....but that was after I already took a bunch...ha!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet!....wish it was closer to my house though....

VI was looking for a canvas "Cowboy bag", which is a canvas cover that you sleep in with your sleeping bag so it keeps the moisture off you and this was the only store in Phoenix that had it.  So, I made the hour long drive from Scottsdale to this place to pick it up.  It's just like Bass Pro Shops, huge and full of outdoor equipment.\u000a\u000aWhen I arrived, I didn't want to mess around with trying to find this thing, so I asked the person at the front to help.  He pointed me to the camping area and described where it was located.  I went to the spot he told me to go and voila, it was exactly where he said it would be.  Who knew these Cowboy bags were that common?  Either that, or he memorized the entire store....LOL\u000a\u000aThe bag set me back $125, but it's been worth ever penny...when I go camping, I wake up warm and dry.  Thanks Cabela's!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90% (if it wasn't so far away, it would be 100%)

VMet a couple of colleagues for lunch the other day and saw @Matt S review that mentioned a Pastrami Melt....so I went for it with Fries.  I wasn't paying, so I didn't get the price....I think it was around $7.95.\u000a\u000aThe Sandwich came out pretty fast.  It tasted pretty good, but the Bread was greasy!  I understand it's a melt, so it should be kind of like a Grilled Cheese Sandwich.....but it was much more oily than that.  The Fries were excellent and the service was very good as usual.\u000a\u000aThis place gets packed for lunch, especially during the weekdays, so get there before Noon if you don't want to wait.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 75%

VSince I've been to Napoli and have had Pizza from the city, I couldn't wait to give this place a try.  I've heard so much about it, it was time for me to visit.\u000a\u000aMy son and I came here after a couple of hours at the Pinball Hall of Fame.  We browsed the menu and decided on getting a Diavola Pizza (Crushed Tomatoes, Finnochiona (Peppered Salame), Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Crushed Red Peppers, Garlic, Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil.) and a Settebello Pizza (Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Roasted Fennel Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil.)  We planned to split each Pizza in half and share it so we can taste both.\u000a\u000aWhen the Pizza arrived, I was pleased to see that it was very similar to the Pizza I had in Napoli.  The first Pizza out was the Settebello.  When I bit into the first slice, I could immediately taste the Fennel Sausage and Mushrooms.....it was sooo good!  The crust is thin and slightly burnt on the bottom, just how I like it.  The ratio of Cheese to Sauce was perfect.  This was a good Pizza Pie.\u000a\u000aThe second Pizza to arrive was the Diavola.  When I took the first bite, the Finnochiona & Red Bell Peppers were the first flavors I could taste....yum!  It too was slightly burnt on the crust.  Another great Pizza Pie.\u000a\u000aThe service was good as we were only 1 of 3 tables in the entire restaurant.  We were there around 4 pm on a Sunday....I hope it was just the time of day that was the cause of the slow business.  I don't want to see this place close down.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  If I'm ever on this side of Egypt, I will.

VSince I moved away from Vegas, it's been almost 3 yrs since I last dined at Settebello.  During a recent trip back, we stayed at GVR and decided to walk over to The District and have dinner here one evening.  I was glad to see it was still around, and most importantly that the Pizza was still very good.\u000a\u000aThis time I went for the Margherita DOC (Crushed Tomatoes, Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, Parmigiano Reggiano, Extra Virgin Olive Oil), $13.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/settebello-pizzeria-napoletana-henderson?select=hkekGVh_GJ4QjwweLrCsjw#hkekGVh_GJ4QjwweLrCsjw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/settebello-pizzeria-napoletana-henderson?select=kfsNFds_cvzeN1IEoAjqZQ#kfsNFds_cvzeN1IEoAjqZQ\u000a\u000aThe Better Half opted for the Settebello (Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil), $13.50.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/settebello-pizzeria-napoletana-henderson?select=LnvEfX_z6Tt0JoZnVA7i3A#LnvEfX_z6Tt0JoZnVA7i3A\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/settebello-pizzeria-napoletana-henderson?select=LFy3ytX6YHx_EBvqvMt6yg#LFy3ytX6YHx_EBvqvMt6yg\u000a\u000aThe Pizza was awesome of course, just how I remember it.  The Crust was slightly burnt and the ingredients were fresh and full of flavor.  They've kept the quality of their product very high.\u000a\u000aOur friend who joined us for dinner was also very impressed.  Although he's lived in Vegas for over 15 yrs, he never had Settebello until now.  He also had the Settebello and was blown away.\u000a\u000aService was good.  The server kept our Wine and Water glasses full.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 92%

VFor my 1600th review, I chose the 3rd and final restaurant in the Scottsdale/Phoenix Mastro's trilogy.  I've dined at the other 2 restaurants and this was the last one....I am now complete! :)\u000a\u000aWhat more can I say about this place?  Outstanding service and food!  Wifey and I dined with 2 colleagues from out of town.  They'd never dined at a Mastro's before, so we decided to go all out and give this location a try.  Here's what we ordered during this visit:\u000a\u000aBeef Carpaccio\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=0A3PEoUl8nKmlvj8EF5-oQ#0A3PEoUl8nKmlvj8EF5-oQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=Ixj6faa-nc0dTkGppacixw#Ixj6faa-nc0dTkGppacixw\u000a\u000aShrimp Cocktail\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=3AR60YF7zUfUTlMkpHYINw#3AR60YF7zUfUTlMkpHYINw\u000a\u000a12 oz Bone-in Filet\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=QVxssj3cmGN4HCaFUaGUUg#QVxssj3cmGN4HCaFUaGUUg\u000a\u000aLobster Tail\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=7Au-elHq0sjklrUCFmc9Rw#7Au-elHq0sjklrUCFmc9Rw\u000a\u000aSwordfish\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=NSB9arDBjuxvveTXfEw9yA#NSB9arDBjuxvveTXfEw9yA\u000a\u000aGorgonzola Mac 'n Cheese\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=LqVgNLZiYkTlHyI4l27kMg#LqVgNLZiYkTlHyI4l27kMg\u000a\u000aButtercake\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=fxt_7zzR_OwjQGnVuODPzw#fxt_7zzR_OwjQGnVuODPzw\u000a\u000aKey Lime Pie\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=Rf66dP2sU3DFvFST48WwfA#Rf66dP2sU3DFvFST48WwfA\u000a\u000aWhipped Cream\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=V4XXNRsCPC481hDNixC9hg#V4XXNRsCPC481hDNixC9hg\u000a\u000aChocolate Cake\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=tNoj-p2RTdwGIyDk-0sDtw#tNoj-p2RTdwGIyDk-0sDtw\u000a\u000aI had the Bone-in Filet and the Gorgonzola Mac 'n Cheese....these are my favorite Mastro dishes.  I sampled the Carpaccio, which was phenomenal....it's soo tender and full of flavor.  For Dessert, we all shared 1,000,000 calories worth of dishes (Buttercake, Key Lime Pie, Chocolate Cake, Whipped Cream)....but it's all good when you're dining in a top notch restaurant with great people.\u000a\u000aI forgot to mention that we put away 2 bottles of Wine during dinner and a nice glass of Port at the end of dinner.  A perfect way to end an evening.\u000a\u000aTip - Don't forget that Mastro's is not cheap.  It's a fine dining joint....expect to pay for it.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VAfter a disastrous meal at the GVR Cafe, The Better Half and I went searching for some desserts.  We browsed all of the menus around the property and decided to give this place a try.  I asked the hostess if the desserts were good here and she said "Absolutely, especially the Fried Oreos!".....Fried Oreos?!!!  Sold!\u000a\u000aSince we just ate dinner, we saddled up to the bar, ordered a couple of glasses of Wine and the following desserts:\u000a\u000aFried Oreos, $9\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hanks-fine-steaks-and-martinis-henderson?select=Fr6o_W_g8jRLTOy1xV966A#Fr6o_W_g8jRLTOy1xV966A\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hanks-fine-steaks-and-martinis-henderson?select=UDuyjS-PR-QMefJCeCiRZQ#UDuyjS-PR-QMefJCeCiRZQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hanks-fine-steaks-and-martinis-henderson?select=QArOEViaXlGNlALYT_4ltQ#QArOEViaXlGNlALYT_4ltQ\u000a\u000aChocolate Cake, $9\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/green-valley-ranch-grand-cafe-henderson?select=rFCV6YBghUVpNiiND6VEbQ#rFCV6YBghUVpNiiND6VEbQ\u000a\u000aLet's start with the Fried Oreos....they are A-W-E-S-O-M-E....!!!  The Oreos are surrounded by a fluffy, Doughnut shell and come with a Creamy Dipping Sauce....when you mix the two together and bite into it, you feel a slight crunch from the Cookie of the Oreo....then all of the flavors combine in your mouth to take you to nirvana....yes, it's that good!  Trust me.\u000a\u000aThe Chocolate Cake is pretty amazing too.  However, I've had great Chocolate Cakes before.  What sets this place apart is the Fried Oreos.  It's so addicting that we stopped here every night of our stay to have them.  It's a must try if you're in the area.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100% (as long as the Fried Oreos are on the menu)

VSwung by here for drinks after work with friends.  We were amazed at how many people were here on a Tuesday night.  The place was busy.  The music is loud, which is perfect for the atmosphere and vibe here.\u000a\u000aSince we already had dinner, we were only here for cold Beer.  I had a Dos XX Lager and the rest of the group had Heineken.\u000a\u000aService here was so/so.  Our server started out well by getting us our drinks right away, but she wasn't too attentive as the night went on....we had to flag her down whenever we needed a refill.\u000a\u000aAlthough we weren't eating, we received complimentary Chips & Salsa....they were average.  The Salsa is very mild, no kick to it at all...what I like to call, Tomato Sauce Salsa.\u000a\u000aI'll have to come back and try the food.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VTarget is our go to place to get decent household items.  A definite stop during Christmas season, it's also a good place to find gifts for co-workers and friends....when you don't want to spend too much money.  The only thing about this Target is that it's tucked in the back near a TJ Maxx and Ross, which means the parking lot can get crazy when it's busy.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a nice, clean store.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VI was very excited to have dinner here.  The Better Half & I have been wanting to give it a try for a while.  We had several friends visiting this weekend and decided to have a group dinner here.\u000a\u000aThere were 11 of us in the group.  Before dinner, we gathered at the bar to have a pre-dinner drink.  The bartender was very friendly and helpful.  He took several pictures of the group at our request and was patient as we gave him 5 different cameras to take pictures with.  The whole time he cracked jokes and told us he would take as many pictures as we wanted....+1 in my book for the service.\u000a\u000aOriginally, we had a reservation for 15 people but 4 didn't make it, so the hostess had to rearrange the table.  The hostess came to get us 10 minutes after our original reservation time....not bad for a last minute change like that.\u000a\u000aWe were seated and our server immediately asked me if we wanted the wine list and who were the wine drinkers in the group.  I gave her the headcount and instructed her to keep our wine glasses full until I said stop.  She obliged and went to get the wine.  I ordered a Malbec from Argentina, it was nice and earthy with hints of blackberry & pepper....perfect! +1 for the wine.\u000a\u000aThe server made several recommendations for the group and we placed our order.  As a complimentary appetizer, they brought out a tray of 3 different flavors of French Fries.  From what I could tell the flavors were BBQ, Plain, and Garlic & Herbs....served with 3 dipping sauces....BBQ, Horseradish, Ketchup.  They were good, the Garlic & Herbs was the best of the 3.\u000a\u000aWhen the food came out, it was presented beautifully on the plates and cooked exactly how we all ordered it.....that's rare for a group this large.  Normally there is one or two that has to send it back because it wasn't cooked right, but not tonight!  I had the 10 oz Filet and ordered it Medium Well.....it was tender and the knife sliced through it like butter.  It had a nice juicy flavor with a smokey & peppery finish.....a great pairing for the Malbec...nom nom nom!  +1 on the Steaks.  I took a few pics of the Steaks for foodie viewing pleasure.\u000a\u000aFor a side dish, I ordered the Truffled Mac 'n Cheese....again, great pairing for the entree....I highly recommend it.  The Asparagus was good too.\u000a\u000aNobody had any room for dessert, so I can't comment on that.  Overall, the dinner was a big hit with everyone.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet your Steaks I will!!

VA friend from out of town visited and we decided to head down to Old Town and bar-hop.  We walked by this joint on the way to Revolver and decided to stop by afterward.\u000a\u000aWe were easily the oldest people in the building.  When we walked up to the bouncer, he said...."oh look, a couple of businessmen"....ha ha!  He didn't even card us!  We walked around for a little while and determined we were WAYYY out of our element.  The music was ok....dance mixed with a little Hip Hop....but the crowd was too young.\u000a\u000aIf I was 10 yrs younger, I'd consider coming back.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 5%

VI rarely shop at Cost Plus, it's just too damn expensive.  However, I was in this store recently to look for Orangina.  I was on a mission to find it.  Unfortunately, they didn't have any......Fortunately, they did have something I've been looking for......Ghost Pepper Hot Sauce.  Yes, they carry the 1,000,000+ Scoville Scale Hot Sauce under the Dave's Gourmet brand! (see pics)\u000a\u000aIf you don't already know, I'm a huge fan of Hot Sauce.  I've only had Ghost Pepper Hot Sauce once and it was at the Chicago Brewing Company restaurant.  I was so excited to be able to purchase a bottle for use at home.  I've only tried it once since I bought the bottle.....IT IS REALLY FREAKIN' HOT!!  I put a toothpick sized portion of it on a bite of food the other night and it burned the living hell out of my tongue!\u000a\u000aBack to Cost Plus.  During my visit they had a ton of Holiday stuff on sale and great prices.  One of the employees told me that I was a little late on finding great deals on the sale....should have come here a few days earlier.  They had Cookies, Chocolates, Candies, and other goodies from the Holidays at really low prices.....good quality imported stuff too.\u000a\u000aOverall, I was pleased with this visit to CP.  Made a mental note to stop by after any themed holiday.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Right after Valentine's Day...you bet!

VWas here recently to meet up with some friends.  The weather was great, so we ate on the patio.  The heat lamps and fire pits were on, so the slight chill didn't bother us too much.\u000a\u000aWe had the Chicken Quesadilla and Duck Quesadilla....both were simply amazing!  Of course, we ate too much Chips and Salsa (complimentary).....but who doesn't?  We topped it off with several rounds of Pacifico.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a great experience.....the service was awesome.  I highly recommend the patio area during the warmer months.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VThis was my first experience eating at an Indian restaurant.  It was a group dinner that was served family style and I had no idea what I was eating.  We didn't order off of menus, someone picked the dishes and we all sampled everything.  I wish I asked what the heck I was eating because it was awesome.....however, I was too caught up in the great conversation I was having with friends and my Wife took care of putting stuff on my plate to sample, so I didn't get the names of the dishes.\u000a\u000aThe service was very good.  They made sure our plates were always full.  The only downside is that their credit card machine is old school and takes forever to close out a check.\u000a\u000aI know this is a useless review for 90% of the people out there, but for those who haven't tried Indian food, I recommend giving it a try.....I was pleasantly surprised and can't wait to go back and try more dishes....this time I'm taking notes.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VI've been an In-N-Out Burger fan for over 20 yrs.  Since my first bite into an In-N-Out Burger at their Camarillo location when I was in High School, I've been hooked.\u000a\u000aNow that I'm well into my 30's, my visits to In-N-Out have dwindled to only a few times a year.....I can't seem to burn the calories like I use to, so visiting one is a huge treat for me.  Last night was one of those nights.\u000a\u000aI ordered a Double Double & a Cheeseburger & Fries.  Of course, they came out prepared just like I remember them.....Sloppy, Drippy, and Nom-ilicous!  I am talking about the Burgers....ok?  The Fries are my fav's too.....you can always tell that they were just cut moments before I walked into the door.  I love it!\u000a\u000aThis location is the closest to my house, but for some reason I've never eaten here.  The drive thru was a madhouse of course, but there was no line inside....bonus!  I love watching them prepare the food as I wait....It amazes me that they can crank out so many burgers and fries so efficiently and consistently.....one of the major reasons why I come back.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  That's a stupid question.....of course!

VOne of my fiance's and I favorite restaurants.  She is a Sushi lover and thoroughly enjoys the Sushi.  My personal favorite is the Thai Peanut Chicken Noodles......I can't really describe it, it just tastes so good.\u000a\u000aMy fiance's favorite dessert is the Passion Fruit Creme Brulee.....I'm usually stuffed by then, so I don't have any room for dessert.\u000a\u000aThe place is generally packed on the weekends.  The best time to go with the least amount of time to wait is during the weekdays around 8 pm.  We go at least once a month, sometimes more.

VIt has been over 1 year since I've been to Kona Grill.  A lot has changed on their menu, which is a good thing.  The Better Half and I were regulars here for many years but got tired of the same old menu and stopped coming last year.  I met a friend here for lunch this past Friday and was glad to see new menu items.\u000a\u000aSince it was Friday, we decided to sit at a table at the bar.  Friday afternoons are happening at Kona Grill, so it was great for people watching.\u000a\u000aThey have a special "Pairing Menu" where you can order any 2 items for $8.50.....what a deal!  The Sandwiches on the menu are 1/2 Sandwiches, so keep that in mind.  I went for the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich and the Avocado Chicken Wrap.  To wash it down I ordered a Stella Artois.\u000a\u000aThe food came out fast and our waitress was very attentive.  My Wrap & Sandwich didn't come with Fries, which was a good thing....I'm trying to cut back on Fries.  The flavor of the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich was amazing!  Full of flavor....and the Bread was delicious.  The proportion of veggies in the sandwich was good too....no single flavor overwhelmed the Sandwich.  The Wrap was just as good.  The Avocado and Chicken were distributed evenly in the Wrap......I hate it when stuff in a Wrap is bunched together so you only taste a single flavor.  That wasn't the case here.....very good.  As a big eater, I was left wanting more though.....but it was probably good for my diet, ha!\u000a\u000aMy friend and I put away several beers before we called it a day.  Overall, I was pleased with the food, service, and menu selection.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet, I want to try more of the new menu items.

VLocated in downtown Phoenix, this hotel is a great place to meet after hours during a conference at the convention center.  It's only a couple of blocks away and I have come here often to meet clients in the lobby to have a few drinks and go over contracts and proposals.\u000a\u000aBeing a local resident, I've never stayed in the rooms and can only comment on the public areas.  The lobby has a cool, modern look to it.  Very clean and upscale.  It's the perfect vibe for conducting business and gets them in the mood to get the deal done.  I've found that the vibe/decor of a meeting place can help or hurt your business deals and can affect people's attitude towards the subject matter being discussed.  The reason why I give this place 4 Stars is because in my experience they've helped me through a few successful negotiations and my clients have always commented on how nice the staff and hotel rooms are.  The lobby has several areas where you can conduct business and maintain a semi-private conversation while remaining comfortable.  That's key to me.\u000a\u000aAs long as this place continues to deliver the goods, I'll keep coming back.  When the other hotels closer to the convention center sell out, I always recommend this place as an alternative to clients visiting from out of town.  So far, it hasn't disappointed them and that means I'm happy too.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VOld Town is a different place during the night & day.  I'm a fan of Old Town.  Here's why:\u000a\u000aDaytime\u000a- There's plenty of outdoor shopping.  Great for walking around during the Fall/Winter/Spring seasons.\u000a\u000a- Large variety of restaurants in a small area.  You can make last minute decisions/changes and still end up at a nice place to eat.\u000a\u000a- Wide variety of restaurants.  From fast food to fine dining, there's something for everyone in Old Town.\u000a\u000a- Art district.  I love walking down the Art district area and window shopping/browsing through all of the art galleries.  That's 1/2 a day right there.\u000a\u000aNighttime\u000a- There's not much in terms of nightlife in Phoenix/Scottsdale/Arizona unless you're in Old Town.\u000a\u000a- There's a "Vegas-like" vibe here.....nothing compares to Vegas, but it's similar enough for me to keep me going until my next trip back.\u000a\u000a- It's the only place in the State of Arizona that has any sign of life after 10 pm.\u000a\u000aThe only complaints I have about Old Town are the parking and the pedicabs.  Parking is hard to find and could cost you $, depending on where you're at.  The Pedicabs are a safety hazard in my opinion and they cut you off and disregard traffic....they're very annoying to me.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VOne of my favorite places because they host so many events that I enjoy.\u000a\u000aBarrett Jackson Auto Auction\u000aArabian Horse Show\u000aParada Del Sol Rodeo\u000aGood Guys Car Show\u000a\u000aHowever, it's not an ideal place for large events.  The parking is atrocious.  Anybody who's made the trek to one of these events knows what I'm talking about.  The lots are dusty, dirt lots and oftentimes there's no organization in the lots....you're left to fend for yourself where to park.  Plus the walk to/from the parking lots is far.\u000a\u000aAlso, traffic flow is awful.  You have to dodge cars between ropes with flags that delineate the lanes of traffic and pedestrian walkways....not really safe.\u000a\u000aThe bathroom situation here is really bad too.  There are too few permanent restroom facilities.  Certainly not enough to accommodate the huge events they host here.  The restrooms are like the public park restrooms you see around town....small, concrete structures with a handful of stalls.  Instead, you have to use port-a-potty's....which are nasty.\u000a\u000aOverall, there are some great events here and in my opinion, the city should put some money into making this a top notch facility for attendees of these events.  However, I just read an article in AZ Central that said Westworld will lose $3 mil in 2014, so I'm not sure any of this is possible.\u000ahttp://www.azcentral.com/community/scottsdale/articles/20130125audit-westworld-faces-million-deficit.html\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100% (because I enjoy the events that much)

VI'm a fan of the Yard House, so when I saw that there was a location at the Desert Ridge Mall, I had to stop by for lunch.  I ordered some Sliders & Fries and a pint of Green Flash IPA:\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p9v9Sl2g_ibaajWvO0NjkQ?select=sy9P0ShsAXZrv2H-CVje9g\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p9v9Sl2g_ibaajWvO0NjkQ?select=9i6Nv0PT-Uye96zJrz8W3A\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p9v9Sl2g_ibaajWvO0NjkQ?select=uK60mVysXfTVfvznGgsozg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p9v9Sl2g_ibaajWvO0NjkQ?select=4AbpvM3j4KJYChtYIz-SFw\u000a\u000aThe Sliders & Fries were pretty good.  You get a stack of 4 Sliders and a pile of Fries.  The IPA went down smooth with the meal...yum!\u000a\u000aWas there during lunch hour on a Saturday, so the wait was short dining at the bar alone.  One of the best things about dining at the bar is that your glass is never empty.....\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VOne of the most upscale local joints in town, Red Rock is one of my favorite places.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a- The decor & design is amazing.  It's not your typical cookie cutter locals casino joint that is shaped like a box.  There are some amazing architectural designs here.\u000a\u000a- The restaurants.  There is a great selection of restaurants here....but keep in mind, they're not cheap.  If you want value, this is not the place for you.\u000a\u000a- Parking.  There is adequate parking and it's easy to navigate to/from your car.\u000a\u000a- Cleanliness.  This place is always clean and well kept.  Some local joints have gone downhill in this respect during the recession, not here.\u000a\u000a- Events & concerts.  They always have cool events like Rock and Roll Wine here.  On occasion, they'll bring in a big headliner so you don't have to go to the Strip to see them.\u000a\u000a- The rooms are awesome.  I've only stayed in a one bedroom suite here, which was an awesome suite.  Lots of square footage, upscale furniture, and the bedding is top notch.  It's a well designed hotel.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  No doubt about it!

VTime for a review update since it's been almost 3 yrs since my last review.  This place has dropped a Star for me.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a great place.  However, they haven't kept the place as clean as it was 3 yrs ago.  The casino has also lost the "excitement"....when you walk through there on a weekday night it's slow and dreary.\u000a\u000aThe restaurants are still solid though.  We ate at Terra Rossa this past visit.\u000a\u000aOverall, this place lacks the energy it once had.  I hope it doesn't continue to decline.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VThanks to a Groupon last year, we found this spot and have visited a few times since then.  Having never been to Gelato Spot, we didn't know what to expect.  We've driven by it dozens of times and it appeared to be a small joint that served Gelato.  When we arrived, we were pleasantly to find a restaurant that offered much more than Gelato.\u000a\u000aMenu items we've ordered during our visits:\u000a\u000aSpicy Pepperoni Pizza (Di Napoli Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Spicy Pepperoni, Tuscan Olive Oil), $9.50\u000a\u000aClassic Pizza (Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Italian Sausage, Mushrooms, Grana Padano, Tuscan Olive Oil), $9.95\u000a\u000aSausage & Peppers Panini (Hot Italian Sausage, Wood Fired Onions, Roasted Red Peppers, Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Tuscan Olive Oil, Grana Padano), $7.95\u000a\u000aGrilled Cheese Panini (Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Provolone, Gorgonzola, Fresh Tomato, Hint of Honey), $5.95\u000a\u000aGelato & Sorbet, $3.99 ea\u000aRaspberry\u000aCookies n Cream\u000aTiramisu\u000a\u000aThe Pizzas are by far my favorite menu item.  They're really good.  I didn't expect to find that in a Gelato joint!  The Panini's are ok, the Sausage & Peppers Panini was too soggy.  The Grilled Cheese Panini was good.\u000a\u000aThe Gelato & Sorbet is awesome.  Raspberry and the Cookies n Cream are my 2 favorite.  You can sample as many as you like before you buy, that's what I like to do! :)\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a nice casual restaurant to visit.  It's order/pick up at the counter, limited service, but the food is great.  The worst part about coming here is the parking.  There's a tiny parking lot with a handful of spots in the back of the building.  If that's full, you'll have to park down the street, which isn't very convenient...especially during the blazing hot Summer.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VI attended the season opener pitting #1 draft pick Brittney Griner (Mercury) vs #2 draft pick Elena Della Donne (Sky).  The US Airways arena was electric.  It was loud and felt like a playoff game.  Unfortunately, the Mecury fell flat.  After a strong start, they couldn't make a shot and the Sky took advantage of that and built a huge lead before halftime.  Meanwhile, Griner was in foul trouble most of the game and it was too late by the time she got back on the floor.\u000a\u000aThe game was a lot of fun.  Too bad the Mercury couldn't take home the win.  The team certainly has a lot of upside....they've since turned it around and are doing well this season despite a slow 0-3 start.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VWent to a Suns game with a friend and had a blast.  The fans were all cheering for the home team and they delivered a win!  I'm not a fan of the team, but love NBA basketball, so there was no way I was going to miss the game.  The crowd was a lot of fun and didn't give opposing fans too much grief in the stands, unlike other cities.  Steve Nash is an incredible player and puts in a lot of effort pre-game to get ready to play....it's no wonder he's one of the best point guards to play the game.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/SfkPbEnDtc1EVTjuS0DDUw?select=qnf3nH3qfObznA_Koxhb0Q\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/SfkPbEnDtc1EVTjuS0DDUw?select=meT5rGbElmR9amJM8oEwKQ\u000a\u000aOverall, it was good times.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VAlthough I'm a Lakers fan, I go to a lot of Suns games because I love to watch basketball.  I'm a big fan of basketball.  This season, the Suns have delivered a subpar product to people attending the games.\u000a\u000a- Fire a popular coach like Alvin Gentry, why? It's not his fault that the team doesn't have the fire power to keep up with 1/2 the league.\u000a\u000a- Get rid of Suns legend Dan Majerle too...?!  That's beyond nuts.\u000a\u000a- Let Nash go for peanuts...?!  (BTW - thanks guys)\u000a\u000a- They generally play 3 to 3.5 good qtr's of basketball before collapsing.  They played Miami and Dallas at US Airways that way.  The exception was when they closed out the Lakers and actually won a game they normally lose this year.  That saved them from a 1 Star review.\u000a\u000aI hope the team gets their act together and produces some consistently good basketball soon.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VI never shop at Food 4 Less, but the Better Half left me a "Honey-Do" list today and her instructions said that I would find Tumeric here.  So, I came all the way down here to look for Tumeric.  Well, it turns out they don't have any and they don't carry it.  The Wifey sent me on a Wild Goose Chase.\u000a\u000aOh well, since I was there I decided I would do a little shopping.  After walking around for about a 1/2 hour, I determined that A) I don't really like any of the items here and B) The items I do like, I can find at other grocery stores at a lower price.\u000a\u000aSo, I quit F-ing around and left.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Probably not.

VOne of the largest parks in the city, this is a pretty cool place to run or play basketball.  You can usually find a serious game of basketball here.  I like to watch them play....there are some good players here, nothing like Venice Beach or Rucker Park, but for Vegas it's not bad for a pickup game.\u000a\u000aDuring the Christmas Season, they use to have a holiday lights festival here, but that was discontinued in 2010 due to the economy.....that's too bad, it was a nice place to bring your kids.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 40%

VI love Spring Training and I enjoy watching baseball, but this place is one of my least favorite ballparks in the Cactus League. Here's why:\u000a\u000a- It's an old facility.  I've been to high school baseball parks which are more modern than this.  How is that possible?\u000a\u000a- There's a small number of food vendors, so the lines are super long.\u000a\u000a- Bathrooms are tiny, so lines get long here.\u000a\u000aThe best thing about this ballpark is that it's small, so there's not a bad seat in the house in my opinion.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/phoenix-municipal-stadium-phoenix?select=R5fVIm59XAsUhsFSpwuQRA#R5fVIm59XAsUhsFSpwuQRA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/phoenix-municipal-stadium-phoenix?select=6cIpBAcPqEVYSnFnQTrQxQ#6cIpBAcPqEVYSnFnQTrQxQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/phoenix-municipal-stadium-phoenix?select=aA5zMGQfL-YiEL8wUKGxEQ#aA5zMGQfL-YiEL8wUKGxEQ\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50% (only when the A's a playing a team I want to see)

VI've never stayed here, but have been here several times for their pool parties and to have breakfast or lunch in their restaurant.  It's a pretty cool place that makes me feel like I'm in a hotel that was designed by a Rockabilly artist.  A quick breakdown of my visits:\u000a\u000a+ The employees are really friendly.\u000a\u000a+ Parking is tough, especially during pool party season.  I prefer to pay the extra for valet instead of driving in circles around the building trying to find a spot.\u000a\u000a+ It's a nice spot for a business lunch or happy hour.  \u000a\u000a+ The lobby lounge and bar is inviting and chic.  \u000a\u000a+ We like to come here for breakfast during the summer weekends before we head out to the pool for their pool parties.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VI Geek-Out every time I come to this place.....and the wallet gets a lot lighter too!  Here's why:\u000a\u000a- The place is HUGE!  Imagine a place the size of a Costco, Sam's Club, or Super Walmart but full of electronics, computers, appliances, and video games!\u000a\u000a- Great selection of everything.  They have 10-20 different types of everything you can imagine.  This is the only place I can spend 10-15 minutes deciding what type of blank DVD to purchase, LOL.\u000a\u000a- Hard to find stuff.  This is where the Geekness comes out in me.  One day I bought 6 surveillance cameras, a digital recorder, and tons of cables just so I could outfit my house in a security surveillance system....did I need one?  No......but it looked like fun to setup so I spent the cash to do it.\u000a\u000a- Electronic accessories.....wired or wireless anything can be found here, name brand/off brand, Mac or PC...you name it, if you can't find the accessory here, chances are no other store in Vegas will have it.\u000a\u000a- Great deals.  Check the Sunday paper.....there's always an insert with a page full of smoking deals......I'm not allowed to see this page.....The Better Half hides it from me.  Why?  Because it tends to bring out the compulsive shopper in me, ha ha!\u000a\u000aI really enjoy shopping here, can you tell?\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Are you kidding me?!

VWe found this joint thanks to Groupon last year.  Since that first visit, we've been here a couple more times.  It's in a shopping center just off Mayo & Scottsdale Rd....for some reason, this shopping center doesn't do very well, places close down frequently.  We're happy that this hasn't. \u000a\u000aHere are some items we've had here:\u000a\u000aMexican Bean Dip, $4.99\u000a\u000aSpinach Con Queso, $5.99 \u000a\u000aNachos, $8.99\u000a \u000aOwner's Chimichanga (Shredded Chicken, Black Beans, Cheese, Rice, Pico de Gallo Charrio Sauce w/Jalapeno Cream Sauce and Green Chili Sauce, Sliced Poblano Peppers, Cheese, Shredded Lettuce and Sour Cream), $13.99 \u000a\u000aUltimate Chimichanga (Roasted Pork, Rice, Pinto Beans, Cheese, Green Chili Sauce and Pico de Gallo), $15.99\u000a\u000aThe food is very good.  My fav's are the Nachos & the Ultimate and Owner Chimichangas.  The Bean Dip and Spinach con Queso are very good too, but if you get those don't get a large entree like the Chimichangas because it's too much food.\u000a\u000aThe servers are friendly.  The restaurant can get packed during happy hour and peak dinner hours.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a nice neighborhood family restaurant.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VA friend of mine from California was visiting and staying at the Palazzo.  So, we decided to give this place a try.  We've heard so much about it.\u000a\u000aFood - For an appetizer, we had the Gnocchi.  It was very good.  We thought the bread was a bit hard and it didn't have much flavor.\u000a\u000aI had the Steak Tagliata....which was very good.  My wife got the Rabbit and thought it was too salty.  She gave me a bite to try it and it tasted just right to me.  We also had the Lamb Chops split for the table so we could try it....they were spectacular!  For a side dish we had the potatoes with rosemary....they were good as well.\u000a\u000aWe drank 2 bottles of wine throughout the dinner....can't remember what it was....ha!  But it was good!\u000a\u000aWe had no room for dessert.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Sure.

When we use to live around the corner from this place we were here all the time.  Now that we've moved, we only come here on special occasions when they have concerts or if they have fireworks on 4th of July.\u000a\u000aIt's a pretty clean and well kept park and it's huge.  There's plenty of restaurant and bar options nearby, so you have a place to go after a long day in the sun.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VThis hotel/casino is a great example of good investments over time.  For decades Caesar's has been a top tier property in Las Vegas.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a- It has consistently changed with the times but never strayed from it's target of being a top notch hotel.\u000a\u000a- The Forum Shops is one of the best shopping malls in the world.  It has a collection of shops that are unrivaled in such a small space.\u000a\u000a- The number of food options allows for any diet or preference.\u000a\u000a- They've remodeled many of the old rooms and have built a new tower.  They've been able to stay relevant by doing so.\u000a\u000a- They have some great nightlife options.  Pure is their anchor nightclub.\u000a\u000a- The location in the center of the Strip allows you to wander around Vegas and experience both the old and new side of Vegas.\u000a\u000aThis is a must see property for our out of town guests.  They've never left disappointed.  I enjoy coming down and shopping at the Forum Shops, which I do 5-6 times a year.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  There's no doubt about it!

VCame here for lunch with my Mom.  It has been a while since we've eaten here.  Since it was Sunday and the NFL games were on, we sat in the bar area.  I'm glad we did because they have Happy Hour all day during the games.\u000a\u000aWe ordered Chips & Salsa to munch on while we waited for our entrees.....it's not complimentary.  I ordered a Bacon Cheeseburger Deep Dish Mini-Pizza, which was 1/2 Off during HH.  Mom ordered the BBQ Bacon Chicken Sliders & Fries, which were $2 Off during HH.  To wash it down, I ordered their Oktoberfest Beer special on tap.\u000a\u000aThe Chips & Salsa were pretty good.....it's not authentic, but we didn't come here for authentic Mexican Food.  The Chips were warm and fresh and the Salsa had a nice kick to it....I'd rate it Medium.\u000a\u000aOur food was ready after a short wait.  My Deep Dish Mini-Pizza was just the right size.....the Crust was moist and buttery and it really tasted like a Bacon Cheeseburger!  Mom was surprised because her plate looked like a mountain of BBQ Bacon Chicken Sliders! (see pics)  There were 4 Sliders on her plate and a mound of Fries.....she told me I would have to help her finish it.....thank God I only ordered a Mini-Pizza!\u000a\u000aI tried the Sliders, which were excellent.  I'm surprised more restaurants don't offer something like this.  The Hickory Smoked Bacon and BBQ Chicken flavors accented one another and the BBQ Sauce had a good tangy flavor to it.....not overly sweet, which I don't enjoy.  The Shoestring Fries were pretty good too....but I didn't have enough room to eat very many of them.\u000a\u000aThe Oktoberfest Beer hit the spot too....I was hoping for a little more hoppy flavor, but it was fine.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a great lunch experience.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet!

VThis is rapidly becoming one of my favorite places to have lunch on Sundays.  They have Happy Hour all day long during the NFL Football games.\u000a\u000aThis visit we ordered the Pulled Pork Sliders ($5.75 happy hour price) and BJ's Favorite Mini Pizza ($5.00 happy hour price).  To wash it down, I had an IPA.\u000a\u000aThe food came out quickly.  I ordered the Pulled Pork Sliders and dove right into it.  They were awesome!  The combination of Pulled Pork, Onion Ring Strings, and tangy BBQ Sauce went well together.  The Onion Ring strings had a nice sweet taste and the BBQ Sauce was tangy and balanced the palate.....the Pulled Pork was very juicy and full of flavor.  Sooo good.  I ordered Wedge Cut Fries with the Sliders and they were cooked just right....not under/over cooked.\u000a\u000aMy Mom couldn't finish her Pizza, so she gave me the last couple of bites.....it was very good as well.  The thick crust was soft & buttery with the edges slightly crispy....hmmmm!\u000a\u000aOverall, another awesome experience @ BJ's!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Hell ya!

VI'm shopping for a car and did some research online for what I wanted.  I found their website and saw a couple of cars that caught my eye.  There's a button to submit an offer for a car, which I did....however, they never responded.  Hmm...so I decide to drive down to the dealership to check it out.  I saw the car there so I pulled in and walked over to take a closer look.  It was really nice and I wanted to test drive it, but it was raining, so I told the guy I'd come back another day when it's dry.  A few days later, it was gone.\u000a\u000aThat was about three weeks ago.  Since then, I've popped in/out several times as they are continuously getting new cars.  The customer service here is so/so.  Sometimes, a really nice guy will come out an greet you and answer questions.  Other times, you have to walk inside to find help.\u000a\u000aThey have a good selection of cars, but damn do they sell fast.  I'm not the type to buy fast, especially with a used car.  I need to do research, etc.  However, in this case I've missed out on every car I was interested in.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VPicked up some Cupcakes from the Bakery.  Tina in the Bakery Dept was great.  She helped us pick something we needed and was very friendly.  We called around to various grocery stores in the area and this one was the cheapest.\u000a\u000aIt's not convenient for us to shop here, but we will because they went over the top for us on a custom request.  We also picked up some Halloween Cookies and a Cake....great prices and good quality.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VA few colleagues wanted to meet up for drinks and it was my turn to meet them on their side of town, so I drove all the way out to this location to have drinks & dinner.  It was around 6:30 pm on a Wednesday and it was pretty busy.  We were able to find a table and settled in.\u000a\u000aI ordered a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger & Fries and washed it down with a pint of Smithwick's.  I've never had Smithwick's before, so I was anxious to give it a try.  It wasn't bad....a little lighter than I expected, but not bad.\u000a\u000aThe Burger came out after a short wait and I devoured it in short order.  It was pretty good and the portion is large...filled me up nicely.\u000a\u000aAfter dinner, we hung out and watched a little baseball.  It was trivia night and it was kind of hard to follow the game with all of the trivia announcements.  Our waitress was nice and friendly and kept our glasses full.  Overall, a good night out.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VWe found this place on the Yelp app and since we don't live anywhere near Chandler, we had no idea what we were in for when we decided to drive down for lunch from Scottsdale.  The restaurant is located inside of an old indoor mall that's not in a good part of town....I'm glad we were here for lunch and not dinner.  Everyone was looking at us like we were from outer space.  We were here for the food, not the ambiance...here's what we ordered:\u000a\u000aCarnitas Tacos, $1.25 & Pastor Tacos, $1.25\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tortas-ahogadas-guadalajara-chandler?select=Xqb_g5Q8wCiIOxz3Gegftg#Xqb_g5Q8wCiIOxz3Gegftg\u000a\u000aPastor Burrito, $5.75\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tortas-ahogadas-guadalajara-chandler?select=_QobIQhnl1-00UTl7CnhlA#_QobIQhnl1-00UTl7CnhlA\u000a\u000aMexican Coke\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tortas-ahogadas-guadalajara-chandler?select=DAXSRhnY8v_qs4qo8cmbzQ#DAXSRhnY8v_qs4qo8cmbzQ\u000a\u000aThe Tacos were amazing...served Street Taco style, they were simple but very good.  The Pastor Burrito was average....the Pastor was very dry, which is unusual to me....Pastor is generally juicy and full of flavor...this was dry and full of flavor...different and it didn't appeal to me.  The Burrito comes with Beans and Rice inside.\u000a\u000aThere's a Salsa bar with a handful of choices for you to place in small, plastic cups.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tortas-ahogadas-guadalajara-chandler?select=WfCsN36Irna9lPTznkcq3g#SguCSpOh3tNAtHMJbK1CQA\u000a\u000aThey have Mexican Coke available here...which is my fav and it comes in larger than average bottle (500 ml).  When you're done eating, you leave your empty bottle on your table and they will come pick it up for you....at least that's what I think you're supposed to do.  We looked around and didn't see a place to put empty bottles....we didn't want to throw them in the trash because there's recycling value to them.  During our meal, we watched several other tables leave their bottles on the table when they were finished, so we assumed that was expected.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tortas-ahogadas-guadalajara-chandler?select=WfCsN36Irna9lPTznkcq3g#DAXSRhnY8v_qs4qo8cmbzQ\u000a\u000aOverall, the food was OK.  When we left, it didn't leave me wanting more.  I'm not sure I would drive all the way back here again.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VI'm accustomed to going to Costco and having the lines be crazy long and people everywhere.  That wasn't the case with this location.  I was here on a Monday at 6:00 pm and the lines were very short and the parking lot was not a hot mess.....am I in the Twilight Zone?  It sure felt like it.\u000a\u000aAnyway, I had to pickup a few items and since I was hungry, I decided to grab 2 Slices of Cheese Pizza ($1.99 ea) on the way out the door.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uMQaaUvdHGhTFiyOhGa93w?select=PrWtJjc8bN3FqTUPyG3Tfw\u000aThey just came out of the oven, so they were piping hot and the Cheese was gooey and tasty....yum!  You can't beat the price of these huge slices either.....great value.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uMQaaUvdHGhTFiyOhGa93w?select=oxrExCvfWrbnfNevyjLVBQ\u000a\u000aOverall, it was another fun time shopping at Costco.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VI love shopping at Costco.  They have many items I want and need.  It's my go to place for Shampoo, Razors, Shaving Cream, Vitamins, Supplements, Toiletries, and much more.  Also, this location has a gas station that's always much cheaper than regular gas stations. There's a car wash here too...although recently I stopped coming here in favor of my all you can wash membership at Clean Freak.\u000a\u000aThe best day and time to come for me is Sunday morning at 10 am when they open.  It's generally pretty slow and you can get your shopping done in peace.  Saturdays are the worst.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VA great place to get your car washed and detailed!  I stopped by on a recent Saturday afternoon to get my car washed after a couple of days of rain.  It has been a couple of years since I've had it detailed, so I paid the extra $$ to get it detailed and hand waxed.  I also added on an oil change....may as well right?\u000a\u000aThey told me it would take 2 hours, so I walked down the street to Ernie's to watch a few games and hang out for a while.\u000a\u000aWhen I got back my car was looking like new!  Awesome!  I did pay a lot for it though......the detail, hand wax, and oil change came out to $243....ouch!  It was worth it though....my car is still clean after 3 weeks of dusty desert driving!  Plus it drives faster..... :)\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 87%

VHad this place on my To Do List for some time now.....finally decided to pop in for lunch.  I ordered a "well done" Small Veggie w/Butter Cheese Crust (Tomatoes, Mushrooms, Onions, Olives, Green Peppers, $9.99).\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sNQ5ZaDneM31V6Qe_19d9g?select=XoGDsNgUlrK9Wb3P_pur2A\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sNQ5ZaDneM31V6Qe_19d9g?select=kqpEk-9H_AngZpHMgGE8ew\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sNQ5ZaDneM31V6Qe_19d9g?select=87Jca8jZku3Jb5TGzwo1jg\u000a\u000aI was curious what the Butter Cheese Crust was all about.....after I got the Pizza I realized that they brush Butter and sprinkle Parmesan Cheese on the edge of the Crust....ok, got it.  The Pizza was OK, not great.  I don't know, it didn't leave me wanting more....I know a Pizza is good when I can finish off a Small Pizza and feel like I can eat another....but this one didn't leave me with that feeling.\u000a\u000aHere's a tip....if you decide you want to dine in the restaurant, like I did, they only have 2 Liter Bottles of Soda, so if you're not in the mood to fill your bladder, bring your own drink.  Also, bring your own napkins too.....I couldn't find any in the eating area.....weirdness.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 40%

VCashed a few checks at this branch.  The teller was very friendly and helpful.  I was in/out within 5 minutes and it was 11 am on a Thursday.  The only downside is that the entrance to the bank has only one driveway which is on the Northeast corner of the road when you're driving North on Scottsdale Road.  If you miss it, you have to drive around a little bit because of how the lights and U-turn restrictions are setup in the area.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

It's kind of out of the way for me, but the food here is solid, so I can't complain.\u000a\u000aI had the Cheeseburger Sliders and Fries.  They were excellent.  Service here is impeccable.  The servers made sure we were well attended to and kept our drink glasses full.  I'd like to come back and have dinner sometime.\u000a\u000aThe vibe here is stuffy country club...so if that's not your deal, don't come here.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

I was on my way to meet a client for a meeting and noticed I left my eye drops at home, so I needed to buy some before my meeting.\u000a\u000aI dropped in here to pick up eyedrops and ended up doing some shopping.

NoRTH  and Chloe's Corner are two of my favorite places here. (separate reviews for each)\u000a\u000aI also enjoy walking around and enjoying the outdoors.

Over the past few years, it has been one of my favorite places to visit from the Fall through Spring season.  It reminds me of Town Square in Las Vegas (one of my fav places of all time).\u000a\u000aThere are a ton of restaurants here.....Bobby's Jazz Lounge, North, Mastro's, PF Chang's, Chloe's Corner, Zinc Bistro....and much more.  We enjoy grabbing an Ice Cream at Cold Stone and walking around.  It's also fun to bring our dogs for a leisurely stroll window shopping.  Definitely worth stopping by if you're in the area.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VI've used this car service many times to go to/from the airport on business trips.  The drivers are always at least 5-10 minutes early picking me up from home, which is great because sometimes I want to leave a little early.\u000a\u000aThey're also very courteous and take care of your luggage and door when you get in/out.  They hate it when I do it myself....that kind of stuff doesn't matter to me, but I've learned to let them do it because I get the feeling that they're required to and will get in trouble if they don't.  I have no idea how they would be audited, but I just go along with it.\u000a\u000aThe cars are always well kept, comfortable, and the AC is always on....in Phoenix, it's important to have the car cool.  There's controls in the back for you to take care of the temperature if it's not right for you when you get in.  There's also a complimentary bottle of Water waiting for you in the back as well.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's an awesome service.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VMy Wife and I have been wanting to try Donovan's for a very long time.  It's taken us 2 yrs to finally give it a try.  After browsing the menu, we decided to order:\u000a\u000aPrime Peppercorn Filet 10 oz, $53\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/donovans-steak-and-chop-house-phoenix?select=Did6OCytPePzwEjhjLBz6A#Did6OCytPePzwEjhjLBz6A\u000a\u000aNorth Atlantic Salmon, $32\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/donovans-steak-and-chop-house-phoenix?select=Eq4wjwTn5jyNpL_bFoq_bQ#Eq4wjwTn5jyNpL_bFoq_bQ\u000a\u000aSkillet Fried Potatoes w/Sauted Onions & Peppercorn Gravy (comes with the entree)\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/donovans-steak-and-chop-house-phoenix?select=aYlGbe8XrtjZ_iN9QD8BgQ#aYlGbe8XrtjZ_iN9QD8BgQ\u000a\u000aThe joint is upscale and the ambience is pleasurable.  Definitely not a place where you want to take small kids who are loud.  We were very impressed by the traditional, dark wood decor and bronze western themed statues.\u000a\u000aIt took a while to get our food...much longer than expected.  But it's a fine Steakhouse, these types of things takes a while.  We enjoyed each other's company while we waited, no big deal.  We knew there was a problem though when a supervisor or manager came up to apologize for the length of the wait...that made us pay attention.  We also noticed that we hadn't seen our server for a while.  We then noticed that a different server was coming to our table to pour Wine from our bottle...I jokingly said "hey you must be our new server"...he had a slight grin and then went away.\u000a\u000aOur food finally arrived and I couldn't wait to dig in.  I had the Peppercorn Filet and after the first bite knew it wasn't for me.  There was way too much Peppercorn on it for me.  Normally, I like it but this was a bit much...my bad for ordering it instead of a regular Filet.  See the pic I posted and you'll see how much Pepper was on there.  I was hungry and it was my fault for ordering it, so I ate it.  The Fried Potatoes I ordered for the side dish was ok.\u000a\u000aThe Wife enjoyed her Salmon a lot.\u000a\u000aAfter we ate dinner, the bus person cleared our table and we sat for a while...where the heck was our server?  I think he might've went AWOL....who knows, but after a while the other server who came by earlier stopped by to check on us.  Normally, if a server goes home sick or takes a long break another server will let you know that they'll be taking care of you...but that never happened here.  Since it was my Wife's birthday, she received a complimentary Creme Brulee...nice touch and she enjoyed it, saved the place from getting rated 2 Stars.\u000a\u000aNext time I will try something different.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VI love Trader Joe's.  This is one of my go to places for daily table Wine at home.  You can find a variety of decent bottles for $5-$10 here.\u000a\u000aThey have good products and prices, but damn does it get packed!  This store is no different....most days you're cramped in the aisles with people shopping.  That doesn't deter me from going, but it has changed my shopping habits....now, I will go less frequently and buy more stuff so I don't have to come back until I have to.  I can't tell you how many "near misses" I've had in the parking lot with soccer mom's SUV's and minivans rushing in/out of this place.  But alas, there's no alternative.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

However, the gas prices are above average and the car wash is a bit confusing....it says "Get a Car Wash for as low as $5"....yet, the Car Wash options shown starts at $6.......???\u000a\u000aUnless I really need gas, I probably won't be stopping by here too often.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 10%

VTime for a review update.  They no longer serve the Cheesy Bean & Rice Burrito, so I had to substitute one of my favorite menu items with a Bean Burrito.  This is in my neighborhood, so when I'm looking for a quick meal, I stop by here.\u000a\u000aThe employees working here are usually very friendly.  There's a kid that works on the weekends that's always super friendly and tries to upsell me on various new items they have....pretty funny guy.\u000a\u000aIt can get busy here on Friday nights when Desert Mountain HS plays their home football games, so if you see a ton of cars and people in there on a Friday, you know what's going on.\u000a\u000aI still get my usual order....7 Layer Burrito, 2 Bean Burritos.  It's good for a quick fill up.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VI've been to the McDonald's a few times, only through the drive thru.  What's really  impressive is that they have a double drive thru, which means there's 2 ordering lanes that converge back into 1, so you can process orders twice as fast.  What's impressive is that to keep up, they have to get the food ready at twice the speed.  I'm not sure why this particular location does this, but it's pretty cool....I've never seen anything like that before.\u000a\u000aThe food here is average McDonald's food....nothing much to really talk about.

They're also very fan friendly and put on some great game day promotions.

I chose the pre-paid full tank option because it was much cheaper than the going price for gas...nice benefit.\u000a\u000aI hope I don't have another accident that I would need the services of this location.

VBilled as the #1 Hit Music Station, KISS FM is on my regular rotation when flipping through the channels.  \u000a\u000aIt's a radio station that I can only handle in small bursts....if I listen to it too long, I feel like I'm Bill Murray in Groundhog's Day.  It's very predictable and you are guaranteed to hear a song come on at least 4 times per hour.\u000a\u000aThe music they play are the top songs on the charts, so it's not too bad most of the time.  Just like any other station, I tune out as soon as a DJ starts yapping.  I listen to the radio for the music.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

VThe name is a bit misleading.  Technically, there's water and this area is located adjacent to it.  However, it doesn't deliver on the goods for people, like me, who are accustomed to a different setting when they see/hear "waterfront" in a name.\u000a\u000aDespite the misleading moniker, this area is still pretty cool at times.  There's a ton of special event.....festivals, outdoor shopping tents, and random celebrations.  I like how they're trying to do something different.  Sometimes I think Scottsdale gets stuck in it's "old ways" and at least this area will try something out of the ordinary and make it interesting.\u000a\u000aIf I were single, I'd live in one of the condos nearby and have great walking access to all of Old Town.  If it wasn't for the name, I'd give it 3 Stars.  The name alone is worth a 1 Star loss because it can't deliver on that promise when the "waterfront" is a canal that an old lady can throw a baseball across the width of it.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VAttended a gun show that was hosted here a few weeks ago.  The gun show was cool, but the convention center is less than stellar.  Bottom line....it's old, dirty, and tiny.  Add to that, parking is not convenient....the gun show attracts a lot of people and parking was scarce.  If you fell asleep in the 1970's and woke up today, you wouldn't know the difference if you were in this place.\u000a\u000aI wouldn't stage events here and would only come back so I can attend a show like this.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

It's located right on the border of Scottsdale and Tempe, so it's convenient when I setup quick meetings with clients and colleagues.\u000a\u000aI'm a pretty boring Coffee drinker....99% of the time, I'll order Coffee and drink it black.  On rare occasions I will try something else.  It's a Starbucks.

V104.3 plays some of the Old School R&B and Hip-Hop that I remember from high school, middle school, and younger.  It's a fun station to tune into and more times than not, I end up smiling because those songs bring back good memories.\u000a\u000aThey don't play any of the hard stuff, it's very mellow.  It's good to listen to when I'm in traffic because it gets me into a good mood.  The only problem is that the on-air personalities talk too much in the mornings, so I end up tuning out when that happens.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VOne of our favorite local bars to grab a bite and watch the game.  It was my hangout joint during the NFL season this year.  They have a decent selection of seasonal Craft Beer and their Burgers are awesome.  Here are a few items we've had over the past year:\u000a\u000aZipp's Wings - $7.95 We get them Extra Hot....and they are extremely hot, but very good!\u000a\u000aBasket of Fries/Onion Rings/Sweet Potato Chips - $3.25  The Fries are superb.  The Onion Rings & Sweet Potato Chips are "meh"...the Rings are soft/crunchy and don't hold together well.  The SP Chips are only good when they're hot & fresh...after a few minutes they get chewy and don't taste good.\u000a\u000aNachos - $6.50  They're ok, nothing special.  Served piled high, it can easily feed 2 or 3 normal sized people.\u000a\u000aBurgers - $8.49 The 1000 Island is my favorite, sooo good!  The Sweet Jalapeno is pretty good, but not spicy enough.  BBQ Bacon is really good too...a high quality Western Bacon Cheeseburger.  Black and Bleu is awesome too but I have to be in the mood for it.\u000a\u000aBesides the food and beer there are tons of large TV screens to watch sports.\u000a\u000aThere's no question we'll be back.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VTime for a review update.  This is one of my regular places to grab a Sandwich for lunch.  They do a very good job making a consistent Sandwich every time I visit.  The Sandwich Artists here should be recognized for it.  It can get very busy during the lunch hour rush, so I recommend coming here before 11:45 am or after 1 pm if you want to avoid the crowds.\u000a\u000aI still order a Footlong BMT w/Italian Cheese Bread, Toasted, Provolone, Mustard, Mayo, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Green Peppers, Pepperoncini, Salt, Pepper, Oregano, Oil, Vinegar....I just can't seem to order anything else.

VNow for a review of my "Nuclear Option" for cold symptoms.....Zicam.  I don't like to use this very often, once or twice a year, but when I do it's because all other options have failed and this is my last line of defense.\u000a\u000aI've used two of their products over the years.....the Throat Spray & their Chewy Lozenges.  The Lozenges work well, but taste awful.  Even though it's flavored, I don't like it.....by the way, my tolerance level for taking nasty medicine is high...these are at the top of the list.\u000a\u000aThe Throat Spray is much easier on the taste buds, although you won't be able to taste much of anything after a day or two of using this stuff.  Their older product was very harsh on the taste buds, not any more.....their new spray has a nice Mint flavor to it....so it's very mild.  But the active ingredients in it is what kills the taste for food.  I don't care though, I don't want to get sick.  It works 8 out of 10 times.  When it doesn't work, I get really sick.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a great product and there isn't an alternative out there that I'm aware of.  We always have a bottle of the spray in the house and I have one that I travel with.  You can get a 2 pack at Costco or Sam's Club.\u000a\u000aThankfully I haven't had to use it this Winter!

VAnother cool spot found via Groupon.  Located all the way up near Troon North, there's no way we would have found this place on our own.\u000a\u000aThere are a lot of interesting Pizzas on their menu, but I decided to order the Wiseguy Pizza (Pepperoni, Sausage, Salami, Proscuitto, Pepperoncini), $16.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rare-earth-scottsdale?select=x4f3MwAQt08eDOqBbxIxag#x4f3MwAQt08eDOqBbxIxag\u000a\u000aThe Better Half made her own Pizza (Sausage, Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Onions, Olives).\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rare-earth-scottsdale?select=KnjgxSUGvqHG9EJwDRnhlA#KnjgxSUGvqHG9EJwDRnhlA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rare-earth-scottsdale?select=fSEzpCv89XBvCn_VB_Y5iA#fSEzpCv89XBvCn_VB_Y5iA\u000a\u000aThe Pizza is made with a thin Crust that's amazingly good....I really enjoyed my Wiseguy Pizza.

VDropped by this Walmart on the way to my friend's house to pick up some supplies for a BBQ.  It's a Walmart.....\u000a\u000a- Long lines.\u000a\u000a- Lots of products.\u000a\u000a- Good prices.\u000a\u000aI picked up some Chips & Sodas and made my way out.

They each have slightly different flavors and textures.  \u000a\u000aI didn't care for the Chicken Wings.  They douse it in Buffalo Sauce here....it's not "baked" into the Wing, so it's more like a dipping Sauce.  I prefer it the other way.\u000a\u000aThe Fries, Breaded Mushrooms, and Mozzarella Sticks are so/so.\u000a\u000aThe Garlic Cheese Bread is awesome.  I could easily order 2 of those and a bottle of Wine and I'd be good to go.\u000a\u000aThe service here is hit & miss.  It's a young group of servers and they haven't quite learned real customer service yet.  However, not much you can expect from a chain pizza joint.\u000a\u000aIt's too far out of the way for us to come here on a regular basis.  If I'm paying full price, there are other Rosati locations closer to our home.  However, if there's another Groupon with 50% off, it will be worth the drive.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VTime for an update.  This Taco Bell is located right off the 101 and is very convenient when I'm on the go.  Since my last review, they discontinued the Cheesy Beans & Rice Burrito (Boo!), so I've replaced it with just a regular Bean Burrito on my normal order.\u000a\u000aThe customer service here is good most of the time.  When you employ teenagers, you don't know what you're going to get, so it's always inconsistent...but they do a good job for the most part.  They've always got my order right and served it up fast.  What more could I ask for?\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VI just became a member here and workout at two different gyms.  Here's a breakdown of this one:\u000a\u000aPros\u000a+ Clean.\u000a+ Nice, modern equipment.\u000a+ They have a theater workout room where you can watch a movie while riding a bike, elliptical, or treadmill.\u000a+ Lots of free weights.\u000a+ They're very strict with watching who goes in/out of the gym, there's a gate that you have to swipe your membership card to get in/out.\u000a\u000aCons\u000a- Not enough elliptical machines with the moving handles.  Oftentimes you have to wait a long time to get on one if it's busy.\u000a- There are a lot of huge bodybuilder types here.  If you're not built like them, using the free weights is a little intimidating.\u000a- Parking can be tight, especially when it's busy.\u000a\u000aThis gym is definitely not for the average person who's self-conscious.  Tons of beautiful people here.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

It reminds me of Golf Galaxy back in Vegas only a little smaller.\u000a\u000aI wandered over to the used golf clubs section and found a couple of drivers that interested me.  I took them to the practice area and hit a few balls with the clubs....unfortunately, they didn't feel good when I hit them, so I passed.  The prices for the used clubs were a little high I thought....still, it's better than paying full price.\u000a\u000aThe other stuff they had in the store was competitively priced with other stores.  Decent selection of shoes and clothing.  I know I'll definitely be back.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VMy car got hit by someone in a parking lot.  It was their fault and they were insured by GEICO.  After going through the claims process, they offered the use of this body shop to repair my car because they have a claims adjuster located on-site to handle the process and that it would be faster.  They also offer a lifetime guarantee and warranty for all work completed by the shop....ok.\u000a\u000aThe process was pretty easy and convenient.  Dropped off the car and then received daily phone calls from the shop keeping me informed of the progress....it was nice, but a little bit over the top.  Since it was covered by insurance, I'm not sure if their pricing is fair or expensive....but the work they did was good.  You really can't tell that the car was involved in an accident.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 75%

The Fries were excellent too...reminds me of the Fries at 5 Guys.  I'll have to look around the Scottsdale area to see if there's a location closer to home.  The meal exceeded my expectations.\u000a\u000aBTW - There's FREE WiFi available in the food court area where Charley's is located.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VThanks to Groupon, we found the gem in our neighborhood.  The dining room is small, so when it's busy, tables are tough to find.

VI don't want to get into the habit of writing reviews for hospitals.  However, this past year I had to visit this one because I got really sick and there were no other options at 8 pm.  \u000a\u000aThe staff here is really friendly and knows what they're doing.  They discovered that I had early stage pneumonia and administered a shot of antibiotics immediately.  Luckily, I didn't have to get hospitalized.  They sent me on my way with prescriptions and the comfort of knowing that I would be ok soon.\u000a\u000aI hope I never return, but if I need a hospital, this is at the top of the list.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - Hoping for 0%

VSprouts is my new go to spot to pick up vitamins and supplements that I can't find at Costco.  Their selection is quite large and encompasses several aisles.  The prices are pretty good too.  This particular store is not in my neighborhood.  I was at a friend's house for a BBQ and forgot a few of my supplements at home, so I drove around the corner to this joint to pick some up so I could stay on my daily routine....it saved the day!\u000a\u000aParking is kind of tight in this shopping center....very busy.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VFor my 1000th review, I decided to choose Chloe's Corner.  I've been here a few times and really enjoy coming here for breakfast on my day off.  Located in Kierland Common,  I love how convenient it is to a large parking lot and garage.....easy in/out access.  I also love the counter seating option.....makes for a very quick meal and comfortable for dining alone.\u000a\u000aMy two favorite dishes here are the Chorizo and Egg Burrito, $6.00 and the Breakfast Sandwich (Eggs, Bacon, Mayo, Cheese), $6.50.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jvnMR2D-YVtnQWCP4PN_kw?select=eHfPsCEtTbF1_xC8RoWe4A\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jvnMR2D-YVtnQWCP4PN_kw?select=1OXc4iFyfif-X4YZl0O2mw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jvnMR2D-YVtnQWCP4PN_kw?select=fxHDSdlPpvOJXGviWzt1YA\u000a\u000aThey're both very simple dishes, but done very well.  The Eggs are prepared scrambled in both dishes with the right proportion of Meat.  Their homemade Salsa goes really well with the Burrito....I just wish it was spicier...although my tastes are on the spicier side than most people.  The portion size of these dishes are just right too, not too much and not too small....I don't need to order 2 dishes to feel full and 1 dish doesn't leave me feeling guilty.\u000a\u000aAs a bonus, the service here is great.  They're always friendly and spot on making sure my Coffee cup stays full or that I'm satisfied before they give me the check.  It's not one of those places that sets your check in front of you while you're eating.....it's one of my Pet Peeves when dining out.\u000a\u000aOverall, I really enjoy coming here.  I look forward to my next visit.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

He underestimated the number of people who attended his party....so, he asked me to run to Walmart to grab a few cheap chairs.  I found one for under $10....perfect, threw 10 of them in the back of his truck and headed back to his house.\u000a\u000aWe were able to pull the truck up to the curb and load in front of the store.

VAnother stop on the Pizza Bender Tour 2011 Edition, I've had this place bookmarked since last year's Pizza Bender Tour.  I was eager to finally get to try it out.  I asked for 2 Slices of Sausage Pizza, but the girl behind the counter told me that all they had was what was in front of me.....wow, this was the first time I've been told that I couldn't customize my Slice order from a Pizza joint.\u000a\u000aOK, so I browsed the available Pizza Pies and decided to order three Slices:\u000a\u000aPepperoni & Jalapeno\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=kfLqk6iyi4eYWlLz45uuPw\u000aMeat Pie (Bacon, Sausage, Pepperoni, Ham, Meatball, on a Double Crust)\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=69kV9XIlg2VoR8DTHSuqng\u000aSuper Meaty (Bacon, Sausage, Pepperoni, Canadian Bacon)\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=9-R9RYbmNcXlysJbumdR9g\u000a\u000aThe total damage was 14.38 for 3 slices.....which seems like a lot to me, but  I couldn't see the per Slice price anywhere on the hand written menu.....so I just paid the bill and moved on.\u000a\u000aIt was lunch time (around 12 pm) and it was beginning to get really busy, so I quickly jumped on an open table near the door.  I asked for my Slices to be "well done", so it took a few extra minutes to heat them up.  It didn't take too long before I was called.\u000a\u000aOnce I brought the Pizza back to my table, I quickly realized that I ordered too much Pizza.  I could easily eat all 3 Slices, but then I'd feel too full.  The Slices are pretty big, so consider yourself warned!\u000a\u000aThe first Slice I went for was the Meat Pie.  The Crust is much thicker than the other Slices of Pizza and the Meats are buried within a ton of Cheese.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=q1Ts-19RUkbAy2GEi11Ciw\u000aI liked the flavor of it although I couldn't taste the Meatballs.  The Bacon, Ham, Pepperoni, and Sausage flavors were easily identifiable and delicious.  The Double Crust was more on the edge of the Slice than throughout the Pie.  Despite wanting to eat this with my hands, I had to commit the Mortal Sin of eating Pizza and ate it with a fork because the weight of the Slice was too much for the thin Crust to bear.  Next time I'll probably just go with the Super Meaty, which is the same ingredients on their normal Thin Crust.\u000a\u000aNext up I went for the Jalapeno & Pepperoni Slice.  Since it's NY Style Thin Crust, you have to fold this bad boy.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=ZiF9E3htkJ-ux6JLyyZtkg\u000aThe Pepperoni was full of flavor and the Jalapenos packed a nice kick.  The Crust was nice and crispy since I asked for it to be "well done".\u000a\u000aLast but not least was the Super Meaty.  I wasn't sure if the crust would hold up with all of that Meat on it, but it did.  The Slice was full of flavor and as I mentioned above, like the Meat Pie, I could identify every Meat on the Slice except the Meatball.  This Slice is the Thin Crust version of the Meat Pie.....very delicious.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=Gx_4cQ3K4pBUBY6L9974aQ\u000a\u000aOverall, I really enjoyed the Pizza here at Joe's.  However, I thought the prices were a bit high compared to other Pizza joints in Vegas.  I guess being so close to the Strip is a big factor.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

VWhen visitors from out of town ask "Where can we stay that has reasonable room rates, good gambling, good food, and near the Strip?"......I tell them South Point.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a- Low room rates compared to the Strip.\u000a\u000a- Great gambling options.....$5 Blackjack, low min bet Craps & Roulette, nice payouts on Video Poker, decent selection of slot machines, generous player's club rewards.\u000a\u000a- Good food.  Their Deli, Steak n Shake, Mexican, and other restaurants are very good and not too expensive.\u000a\u000a- Movie Theaters.\u000a\u000a- Equestrian arena.\u000a\u000aThis is such a well built and run property.  The only gripe I have is the surface lot self-parking is far away from the entrance of the casino.  However, it won't stop me from coming back!

VTime to update my review.  Since we moved away from Vegas a few years ago, we've come back to the South Point a couple of times, during the NFR Rodeo or when they're hosting an equestrian event.\u000a\u000aThis is a really fun place to be during those events.  During the NFR, the South Point is the host of the Gold Buckle presentations every night in the showroom.  It's full of Cowboys & Cowgirls and there's music and parties in every bar.  With cheap food and drinks, it makes for a fun evening.\u000a\u000aAll of the other points from my past review are still valid as well.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

VKLUC is one of the few radio stations that hasn't changed format since I arrived in Vegas in '93. They play a variety of old school and new music and have a goofy morning show, The Morning Zoo.  \u000a\u000aDespite being only 300 miles or so away from Los Angeles, our radio stations aren't even close....KLUC is one of the closest to those type of big city stations.  This is one of the most popular radio stations in Vegas, but I don't listen to it much anymore except when I'm surfing channels from time to time.

VMy Son has tutoring here every once in a while and I study on occasion while he's in his tutoring session.  Of all of the local libraries I go to, this one is not one of my favorites.....here's why:\u000a\u000a- It's too small.  During my most recent visit, it was freakin' packed and there was very few spots to study.\u000a\u000a- The staff members here aren't friendly.  During my last visit a security guard told me to take my feet off the furniture.....they weren't on the furniture!  I was resting my calves on a chair (feet hanging off the edge)......I'm not stupid enough to destroy furniture by putting my dirty shoes on it, but he didn't care and made me take my leg off the corner of the chair......meanwhile, obnoxious teenage kids with ringing phones were allowed to talk loudly.  WTH?\u000a\u000a- Uncomfortable furniture.  I don't know why all of the libraries in Clark County have different furniture....but they do.  The Sahara and Buffalo libraries have comfortably chairs and sofas with coffee tables to study at.  Not here....they have chairs and tables that aren't too comfy.\u000a\u000aOverall, not my favorite place.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Only to take my Son to his tutoring sessions.

VWhen I'm looking for a little better quality stuff than what Wal-Mart can deliver, I head to Target.  This particular store is one of my favorites in Las Vegas because it's a Greatland Store....which means it's massive and has a lot of items to choose from, which is what I prefer when I go to a big-box store.\u000a\u000aThis store is also always very clean and the employees are friendly.  I was there earlier today to pick up various household items and was able to find it easily and get through the checkout line quickly.....two huge points in my book.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Absolutely!

VWhen it comes to Pancakes, I'm a simple guy.  Give me some traditional Buttermilk Pancakes and I'll be a happy camper.  That's what I get 99% of the time I come to IHOP.  This location is in the middle of Summerlin, next the the gym I work out at.\u000a\u000aIt's one of the nicer locations in town as they've kept it clean and comfortable.  The employees here are always friendly and I've never had any issues with the service.  It gets really busy on the weekend, so I normally come here with the family on a weekday morning.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet.

VI remember when this place opened up many years ago.  It was a very new concept for the Las Vegas area and pre-dated the more successful Town Square.  It could never catch on like Town Square and many of the restaurants/shops I remember from the early years are gone.\u000a\u000aHowever, I'm glad to see there are some restaurants and shops still open.  During a recent stay at GVR, we walked around The District almost every night.  The weather was perfect.  It's not as busy as I remember it.  The restaurants had some people dining, but it wasn't as bustling as the boom years.  Despite all of that, we had a good time window shopping and had dinner at Settebello Pizza one night.\u000a\u000aI hope this place continues to make it through the tough economy and adds more stores/restaurants.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VI was in Vegas for a weekend golfing with some old friends and I broke my driver's shaft on the driving range....bummer!  Instead of paying for an expensive one at the golf course, I drove to this store to pick up a new one.  It's a good thing I used to live here because I knew exactly where to go.  This store was where I'd shop for all of my golfing needs.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VIt's been a while since I've been on Fremont Street.  Came here the other day to check out the new Zipline attraction (separate review for that here http://www.yelp.com/biz/fremont-street-flightlines-las-vegas#hrid:Ym-pbDyo5N79ZZHAIJPuLQ ).  Here's my breakdown:\u000a\u000aPROS\u000a- You can walk around from casino to casino.\u000a\u000a- There are always cool events & concerts during holidays.\u000a\u000a- Cheap drinks & food.\u000a\u000a- Cheesy FREE light show on the canopy.\u000a\u000a- Cheesy carnival atmosphere with vendors doing crazy things to get your attention.....sort of like a sterile Venice Beach.\u000a\u000aCONS\u000a- There's a lot of shady people Downtown.  Watch your belongings....especially if you're looking up watching the light show.\u000a\u000a- Parking.  Most places make you pay for parking, unless you're a guest of the hotel.\u000a\u000aAfter this recent trip, I was reminded of how much I use to enjoy this area.  Before I got married my friends and I would come down here for cheap eats and drinks.  Now, we rarely come here.....it's lost it's appeal with me.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I definitely will for the Ziplines but won't run out of the house to come back.

It's very ghetto and there are a lot of teenagers here hanging out and drinking.....not a good combination.  We didn't feel comfortable here at all.  We walked to the new East Fremont entertainment district instead.\u000a\u000aI can't wait until they re-open the ziplines...that will probably bring me back.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VI have to thank @MARIANNE Y. for pointing me in the right direction and referring this place to me.  Now this is going to sound a little strange but I didn't come to a Hardware Store to purchase home improvement items.  I came here to purchase Hawaiian food items.....yes, you read correctly.....they sell Hawaiian snacks and other products here!\u000a\u000aI was on a mission to buy two things.....Li Hing Mui (which is a sweet/salty dried Plum snack) & Dark Chocolate Dipped Hawaiian Shortbread Cookies.  I found both here!\u000a\u000aYou can imagine my surprise when I found it.....I was a bit skeptical....Hawaiian Food in a Hardware Store?  But it was true!  The Better Half looooves those Hawaiian Dark Chocolate Shortbread Cookies....and we typically only get them when we go to Hawaii or when the family from the Islands visits.  Since it was her Birthday today, I decided to surprise her when she got home from work and bought a couple of boxes of these bad boys.\u000a\u000aThere is a bunch of other Hawaiian things here too......fresh made Leis for graduation.....Lei making accessories, snacks, t-shirts, you name it.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet!

There aren't too many places in Vegas like this.  I think there is only one other Antique Mall.  We didn't find anything on this particular visit, but saw a lot of interesting items....(see pics).\u000a\u000aWill we return?  Wifey will several times this year and I'm sure I'll tag along on a few visits.

VOnce upon a time, this was the only Del Taco that was near my house.  I would drive 10+ minutes out of my way to stop here....ahh the college years were always good times.  Now, I only stop here when I'm in the area and need to find a quick bite to satisfy my growling stomach.  It can get pretty crowded during the lunch rush, so I try to avoid it if possible.\u000a\u000aTheir speed, accuracy, and quality is about par with other Del Taco restaurants.  I enjoy the Big Fat Chicken Tacos and Veggie Works Burritos.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Sure.

VWas referred to this place via a thread in Yelp Talk.  I am always on the lookout for a place that makes good sandwiches.  I decided to give it a shot for lunch.\u000a\u000aFood - They use Boar's Head meats here, which is always a good thing.  I asked the guy behind the counter what the most ordered cold sandwich was....he said the #2 Italian.  So, I went with the recommendation.  I also added in Fried Raviolis as they looked so tempting on the menu.  The food was pretty good....not great, but good., which is why it got 4 stars from me.\u000a\u000aAtmosphere - It is kind of like Roma Deli, only smaller.  They sell canned/packaged food as well as a good selection of hard to find sodas and ice cream.  The family is clearly from New York & are fans of the Mets.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Yes, because there are other sandwiches I'd like to try.

VMy lunch appointment was canceled today, so I decided to head to Cugino's and try their Pizza and Cappicolo/Salami/Provolone Italian Sandwich (#2 on the menu).\u000a\u000aTheir Pizza is a traditional NY Thin Crust Pizza (see pics).....very good!  Easy to fold...(like it's suppose to be)....Fuggetta-bout-it!  I had a slice of Cheese Pizza to get the lunch started while I waited for my sandwich.\u000a\u000aThe sandwich came out and was the perfect portion, not too large, not too small.  They use Boar's Head deli meat, which is one of my favorites.  The bread is good and there's just the right amount of oil/vinegar...not too overwhelming like some other sandwich joints.\u000a\u000aWhat a great lunch.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  What's the mattah you!....of course!

VAttended the UNLV vs UNR game last Saturday.  I've lived in Vegas for over 17 years and besides a few updates here and there, not much as changed with Sam Boyd Stadium.  It is seriously outdated and needs a major renovation or a new Stadium needs to be built.  Here's a breakdown of the joint:\u000a\u000aPROS\u000a- Because it's so small (38,600 seats), it's a great view from any seat in the house.\u000a\u000aCONS\u000a- It was built in 1971, renovated a few times, but is very outdated.\u000a\u000a- The food here is atrocious.  I won't eat food here.  On Saturday we ate at a Pizza joint before we drove here and then ate at the Tailgate Party before we walked into the Stadium.....that's how bad it is.\u000a\u000a- Parking is on dirt lots that are either really dusty or muddy, depending on the weather.\u000a\u000a- The seats are bench seats....like a high school football stadium.  Actually, my Son's high school has a better stadium than this.....seriously.\u000a\u000aIf you're here because you love to watch Football, or a concert and don't care about the comforts of a modern stadium, then you'll be fine.....if you want all of the perks that a newer stadium has, this is not the place for you to come.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I have no choice, so I will.

VIt's been 3 years since the last time I attended a game at Sam Boyd Stadium.  Not much has changed.  The Rebels are still terrible and the stadium is subpar when compared to other college stadiums.  They did win against Western Illinois the night I went, so that was a plus.\u000a\u000aThe stadium is outdated and the concessions offered here are terrible.  All of the points I made in my original review still apply....someday UNLV will build a new stadium and that will change, I hope....\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VWas in the area and stopped by for lunch.  It was around 1 pm and the restaurant was empty....perfect!  I ordered a 12" BMT, toasted, on Italian Herbs and Cheese Bread ($6).\u000a\u000aThe Sandwich Artist made my sammie to order and it tasted very good.\u000a\u000aAnother great visit to Subway.  They're pretty consistent and that's why they're one of my favorite places to go when I want a quick, cheap meal.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Sure.

VWhen I'm in the mood to listen to good 70's and 80's music, I turn the dial to KKLZ.  They play some good stuff on this radio station.  It's definitely on my regular rotation of channels that I surf when I'm in the car running errands or getting from A to B.  Their morning show isn't as good as Foxx & MacKenzie, but is not too bad.\u000a\u000aI hope they don't change their format anytime soon.

VI enjoy banking with Wells Fargo.  Their staff is friendly, they have plenty of locations, and they have always treated me well.\u000a\u000aThis location is convenient for me to stop by when I'm going to the gym.  It has a drive-thru and a couple of ATMs on the exterior near the front door.  The bank is always clean and the people at this location always greet me with a smile.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  As long as I have money in the bank.

VOne of the few gas stations and convenience stores near the Las Vegas Strip, we fill up on gas here before heading back home.  The gas station portion of this place is an ARCO, which means that if you want to pay at the pump, you have to use your debit card.  Credit Cards won't work at the pump.  The lanes are very tight here and it gets very busy at times.\u000a\u000aThe location is convenient though, so it's worth the hassle.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VI live on the other side of town and rarely visit Green Valley.  I was at GVR for a conference and went to a cocktail mixer at Kennedy Tavern.\u000a\u000aIt was a Tuesday night and besides our party of 50 people, there wasn't very many people there.  It would have been dead.  I had a few drinks and enjoyed the atmosphere.  The servers were very friendly and attentive.  I didn't get a chance to try the food.\u000a\u000aWill I come back?  If I'm back in Egypt, I'd consider it.

There's some great no named Hot Sauce you can get here.\u000a\u000a- Hand sanitizer.\u000a\u000a- Eye drops.\u000a\u000a- Dish soap.\u000a\u000a- Shaving cream.\u000a\u000a....and much more.  I always end up buying random stuff on the way out....the Bubble Gum is a good example of that.  What the hell...it's less than a $1 right?!  Ha!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet.

VCame here recently to purchase the Rosetta Stone software (separate review of that store).  I'm a fan of the Fashion Show Mall, here's why:\u000a\u000aPROS\u000a- Easy in/out.  The underground parking lot with the entrance across the street from the Trump Towers is a great spot to get into the middle of the mall easily.  With the exception of Christmas Shopping Season, I can get in/out with no issues.\u000a\u000a- Great stores.  Despite being on the higher end of the scale, this mall has some great stores.  Some of my favorites are Tommy Bahama, Zara, Front Row Sports, Dillard's, Nieman Marcus, Sak's 5th Ave.\u000a\u000a- Decent food.  There are some good food choices here.  Johnny Rockets, Maggiano's, and California Pizza Kitchen are a few of my favs.\u000a\u000aCONS\u000a- It's on the Strip.  That means it's not convenient to get there for a local.\u000a\u000aOverall, I like this mall a lot.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Of course!

VWith the decline of most of the malls in Vegas, this one has withstood the test of time by remaining one of the best shopping malls in the city.  Despite larger, newer malls opening up in a couple of the large casinos, this one has remained relevant.\u000a\u000aWe visit Vegas 8-10 times a year and drop in here every 3 or 4 visits.  It's located on the Strip, so it's convenient for us since we live out of town now.  The season ending clearance sales are always fun because you can find some great styles for cheap.  The food choices here are excellent too.  Everything from cheap eats to high end restaurants are located in this mall.  The restaurants that are on the Strip side of the mall offer great people watching opportunities too.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VOne of the oldest Kinko's locations in Vegas, this place was my "go to" spot when I lived at the Lakes just up Sahara.  Now, I rarely come here unless I'm in the area.  This Summer I visited this location twice, most recently a few days ago.  It was refreshing to see that this location was still well run and delivered great service.\u000a\u000aHere's why I like this location:\u000a\u000a- Large Self-Service area with Copy, Printing, Fax machines....both color & b/w.\u000a\u000a- Plenty of staff to help you....some Fedex Kinko's are very small and only have 1 or 2 people working, which can make it frustrating if it gets busy....not here.\u000a\u000a- Ample parking.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet!

VThis place is old and it shows.  I'm here at least 3 to 4 times per year for the NFR, NBA, & UNLV Basketball games.  While I enjoy those events, this building is not so good.  Here's why:\u000a\u000aPROS\u000a- Great seating with awesome views of the court/event floor.\u000a\u000aCONS\u000a- The food and beverage selection sucks.  This place is stuck in the 90's.....given what you can get at more modern arenas, this is sub-par.  Besides the domestic draft beers you can get a couple of craft beers, but only a very small selection.\u000a\u000a- The video screen is outdated.  It's the grainy, low quality, large pixel type screens that you saw back when the Rebels won the National Championship in 1991.....I don't think they've updated the screen since then.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's decent.....I've been in worse arenas.....but it's nowhere near the level of the new ones built since the mid-90's.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I will, we have no choice.

VI enjoy coming in here and having a Beer or two or three with friends.  Sometimes I bring my family along....but that's only for food.  One of my favorite dishes here is the Kobe Burger.  It's a must try if you're a fan of Burgers.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a good time but it's not a place we come to very often.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I'm sure I will.

VWhat happened to Taco Bell?  It use to be one of my favorite Guilty Pleasures....it has fallen so far down my list, I don't even crave it anymore.  Why?\u000a\u000a- Because their portions are much smaller.\u000a\u000a- Prices increased.\u000a\u000a- Quality of the food downhill.\u000a\u000aMy most recent visit the other day I ordered a 7 Layer Burrito ($1.99) and 2 Bean Burritos ($1.09).  The Bean Burritos were the size of the ones they sold a few years ago for 69 cents....now they're $1.09?  They're freakin' tiny and unsatisfying.  The 7 Layer Burrito has taken a huge hit in quality too.....all of the ingredients tasted bland.....blech.  Also, Taco Bell has the habit of not putting out their Fire Sauce for people to use....only Hot & Mild.....and when you ask for some, they give you 2 packets for each item.  I can easily use up 4 or 5 per item....whatever.\u000a\u000aOverall Value - Even though I spent less than $5, it was garbage.  Only reason why I stopped by was because of old memories of good junk food.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Eventually, someday.....but not anytime soon.

VVery cool store located in the Las Vegas Outlet Mall on Las Vegas Blvd.  Was here recently doing some Christmas shopping.  They always have a good selection of shoes and the employees are very helpful.  They helped me find a style and size of shoe that would be just right for my Son.\u000a\u000aMy Son wanted shoes for Christmas.....found a pair I thought he'd like based on the recommendation of the sneaker head employees (they know their stuff).  When he opened the present, he was ecstatic!\u000a\u000aJob well done, thanks Adidas!

VStopped by this location because I wanted to get a few vaccines prior to my trip to Beijing next month.  Was told by our health insurance company that they offered vaccinations here and it was 100% covered....so I made the trip this morning.\u000a\u000aI was pleased to find nobody waiting in line.  Since it was my 1st visit, I had to fill out paperwork....the best part?  It was done via a kiosk!  That's right, no forms....a simple, easy to use interface that walked you through step by step.  It took me less than 2 minutes to complete the process.\u000a\u000aSince I didn't have my health insurance card on me, I thought there would be another long wait while the technician looked up the info.  Nope, she found The Better Half's (TBH) info in the system and was able to get everything she needed.  \u000a\u000aBam!  3 minutes into the visit, I was getting prepped for the vaccination shots.  She carefully prepared each shot and I got whacked on both arms.  I was out of there....soup to nuts within 15 minutes.  She advised me to stick around the store for 10 to 15 minutes just in case I had an allergic reaction to the vaccinations....and gave me a 10% OFF coupon just in case I bought anything.\u000a\u000aWhile I was walking around the store I found Mexican Pepsi in the cooler, score!  Dammit, can this store get any better right now?  Hell yeah!  They had two 3-packs of 5 Gum for $7 and a 2-Pack of my favorite toothpaste, Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint, for $5.99!  What a score!\u000a\u000aCould that have been a ploy or setup by CVS to keep me around the store to shop?  Maybe....Probably....but I would have purchased these items anyway and I saved a little money in the process.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet I will!  Wish it was closer to home.

VMy last trip to Vegas I didn't rent a car, so we cabbed it everywhere.  We used this cab company a few times that weekend and was pleased with the service.  They didn't longhaul us and actually asked which route we preferred once the drivers found out we were former locals.  However, the cabs were beat up and 2 of them didn't have a working AC.  Thank God it wasn't that hot yet.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VKohl's reminds me of what JC Penny was like when I was growing up....a find everything department store.....only with better stuff.  The odd thing is that I never "want" to go to this Kohl's, but I invariably end up here when searching for a gift for someone.  Unlike their Irvine location, they don't have any USC gear, so it's not on my regular shopping list.\u000a\u000aI've found many birthday and Christmas gifts here.  I bought a golf accessory set for a few of my golf buddies for Christmas last month.....they loved it and it was priced just right at $14.99.\u000a\u000aThe only complaint I have about this place is it seems to be slightly understaffed.  I've had difficulty finding help when I need it.  Other than that, it's a pretty pleasant shopping experience and Golf Galaxy is next door....+1.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 75%

I always browse the used golf clubs area for Wedges or Drivers that might catch my eye.  I saw a few Ping G15 Drivers, but they were still a bit expensive for what I was looking for ($247 - $299)....I'll wait until they're in the low $100's.\u000a\u000aIt's always a great shopping experience there.

VI've had this Pizza joint on my radar for a long time.  I'm always in the neighborhood, so I don't know why it took me this long to finally try this place.....well, the Pizza Bender Tour 2011 Edition finally brought us together.\u000a\u000aI was hoping to get 2 Slices of Sausage Pizza, but they didn't have any so I settled on 2 Slices of Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza.

VI've never had a bad experience at a Wells Fargo branch.  This location is no exception.  The cashier I was dealing with was fast, efficient, and friendly.  She even suggested a few of their financial products that I might be interested in......I passed, but it was the thought that counts.\u000a\u000aAlthough I'm in the area often, I didn't notice this location until recently.  Since I'm in the area 4-5x a week, I'm sure this will be a regular spot for me.\u000a\u000aOverall, a solid visit to the bank.  Return Factor - 80%.

VI was on this side of town for an early evening meeting and had a few hours to kill.  I didn't want to drive home and burn the gas and waste time, so I came to this library to get some work done.\u000a\u000aI enjoy going to the public libraries near my home and had been to this library before, but that was years ago.\u000a\u000aI was disappointed to discover that this library is nothing like the libraries in my neighborhood.  The furniture is old and they don't have any seats with cushions!  All of the seating was hard wood chairs on community tables where you have to share your space with up to 4 people.  Other libraries that I visit often have individual, padded chairs with more privacy.....this was Strike 1.\u000a\u000aI settled onto a table with one other person who seemed to be minding his own business and quietly reading....perfect.\u000a\u000aAbout 30 minutes later a couple of teenagers sat at the table next to me and began talking a bit loudly......several people including myself gave them a dirty look.  They didn't care.  Then one of them got a call on his cell phone......the phone wasn't on vibrate and was ringing loudly.  Perfect, now the librarian will come over and throw them out......there is a "No Cell Phone Use" policy in the library and I've seen people get evicted for using their phone at the libraries in my neighborhood.....not at this one!  He continued to talk for several minutes.....meanwhile I watched several library employees nearby do nothing.....Strike 2.\u000a\u000aNow I'm a little pissed.....a few minutes later, he gets another call!  Still no action from the employees.....Strike 3.  By this point, I was too mad to concentrate.....I left immediately and went to a bar/lounge that I knew would be more peaceful than that.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Not unless I'm forced to.

VI admit it, one of my guilty pleasures is fast food.  I try my best to stay away from these joints, but I can't help it every once in a while.  This Jack In The Box location is most convenient because it's a few blocks away from my house.\u000a\u000aI like coming here because it's at the gas station I use the most and the drive thru is usually pretty fast.  The food is always hot and fresh and I've never had any issues with taste.\u000a\u000aMy most recent visit, I ordered a Big Cheeseburger and a Bottle of Water.  Simple order, but one of my fav's.  It was as tasty as a JITB Burger can be.  It did the job.....filled my tummy.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Unfortunately, yes.

VAte here with my Son here last week during our lunch break at Three Square.  I ordered my usual toasted footlong BMT w/Provolone, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions, Green Peppers, Pepperoncinis, Mustard/Mayo, Oregano, Salt & Pepper, Vinegar & Oil on Italian Cheese Bread ($4.99).  Yum!  They made it perfect and the service was fast.  The Bread was fresh as usual and the joint was clean.  \u000a\u000aWhat more could you ask for from a chain restaurant?\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I think I found my new lunch spot when I volunteer @ Three Square.

This place is a dump!  It's old and very smokey.  The last time I was in this casino, was in the late 1990's and it still looks the same.\u000a\u000aI watched basketball games for around 2 hrs while TBH shopped and when I walked back to see her, she said I reeked of smoke....yuck.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 5%

VWas hungry for quick Mexican food, so I stopped by this place.  I've passed by it a hundred times and finally decided to try it.\u000a\u000aThis place reminds me of Qdoba & Chipotle.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Nachos & a Quesadilla.  The Nachos were tasty, but I thought that they drenched it in the ingredients and the bottom half of the dish was soggy....I hate that.  The Quesadilla was good...not great, just good.\u000a\u000aThe service was ok....they didn't offer me all of the fixings...I had to ask for guacamole & green salsa, it wasn't offered....this is unusual for a place like this.  Normally, they try to upsell the hell out of you with the extras.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Maybe.  I still like Qdoba & Chipotle better.

The Pastrami Burger was very tasty.  The only thing I would change is add more mustard....I like a lot of mustard with Pastrami.  The order of fries were huge for a small....enough for 2 people.  The fries were ok, not great.\u000a\u000aThere are so many other things on the menu that I want to try that I will definitely come back.  Next time, I will try one of the Hot Dogs.

VMet a colleague here for lunch the other day.  It was my first visit to Frank & Fina's.  I arrived early and was seated promptly by the hostess.  While I was browsing the menu, the owner Frank came out with Chips & Salsa and asked for my drink order suggesting a Margarita or Beer....hmmm, ok!  You don't have to ask me twice in a Mexican Restaurant if I want a Margi or Beer.  I ordered a Pacifico....what the hell, I don't have to go into an office and my afternoon was clear.\u000a\u000aWhile I waited for my friend, I decided I'd order the Nachos.  He arrived a few minutes later saw my Pacifico and ordered one for himself....I love how contagious Beer in a Mexican Restaurant can be!  We ordered our lunch and I like how the waitress asked me if wanted Jalapenos on my Nachos....I asked her if they could cut it fresh and put a lot on top...she said yes.\u000a\u000aWe had a nice conversation while we waited for our food, which came out a short time after we ordered.  The place was packed for lunch and I expected the service to be much slower, but it wasn't.\u000a\u000aThe Nachos were very good.  The proportion of Cheese, Guacamole, and Sour Cream were just right.  The proportion of Salsa and Onions were good too, relative to the amount of Chips.  The portion was on the Appetizer menu and it could easily feed two or three.  It's not a huge pile of Nachos like you find in some restaurants. For $5.50, it's not bad.  The flavor of all the ingredients were very good too.  The only complaint I have is that the Chips are too thin....they broke easily with the slightest amount of pressure....which forced me to eat most of the Nachos with a Fork.  That's sacrilegious to some Nachos aficionados...LOL\u000a\u000aWe had another Pacifico and continued our conversation for a while after lunch.  It was a pleasant experience.  As a bonus, I ran into two friends I haven't seen in 8 yrs who were sitting a the table next to us.\u000a\u000aOverall it was a good time.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Of course!

VI really enjoy shopping at the pawn shops in Vegas.  There's always a good selection of products.  This location has a nice selection of jewelry and watches.  \u000a\u000aOn a recent visit, I found a ring for The Better Half.  I bought it at a great price and squirreled it away for a future gift.  The Superpawn stores in Vegas are willing to deal with you.  I offered 30% less than their asking price (not sticker price) and got it....I probably should've asked for more, but once they agree it's hard to go less than that.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VSo my Son comes to me the other day and says.....\u000a\u000a"Dad, I have to go to Del Taco and buy 34 Tacos for a school project"\u000a\u000a....I said "What are you trying to pull?!  What class is this for?"\u000a\u000a....he says "Health".\u000a\u000a....I laugh my ass off and ask him if he's serious.  Apparently, he was.  They were studying the nutritional contents of Fast Food and if he brought in 34 Tacos for the entire class he'd get extra credit on his project.\u000a\u000aOf course, this was too funny to pass up so of course I agreed to do it.  So we left for school a little early this morning and I called ahead to ask the employees how long it would take to make the Tacos.  They said they'd start working on it and that they would be close to having it ready when we arrived.  10 minutes later we arrived and they were 1/2 way done with the order.  We waited another 5 minutes or so and we were on our way.\u000a\u000a34 Tacos ($14.33).....extra credit for kiddo, priceless.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  This Del Taco has their act together....of course!

VCame here to meet a colleague today for coffee.  It's a nice location with ample seating and of course FREE WiFi.  The staff here is friendly and the big bonus is that the other patrons are nice too.....I've been to some Starbucks in Vegas where I didn't care for the other customers as they were very rude and filthy.\u000a\u000aThere is also ample power outlets for your laptop and the spacing between tables is comfortable, not cramped.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I think I found my new hangout spot in the afternoons.

VThis is my favorite Sears store.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a- It's clean.  Items are always kept organized and I can find my way around the store.\u000a\u000a- It's never busy.  I predicted that this store would close years ago....obviously I'm wrong.  I don't understand how they can stay open with the lack of business they have......oh well, it just means I can shop in peace....perfect!\u000a\u000a- The electronics selection.  I've found some great deals on TV's and home audio here.  I recently bought a DVD player for $29 and it works great.\u000a\u000a- Clothing selection.  When I'm looking for cheap T-shirts or pullover sweatshirts....basically, stuff I wear when I'm bumming around the house, I like to stop by here to check out their clearance rack.  I don't believe in spending a lot of money on those kinds of clothes and this store has some great deals from time to time.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a pleasant shopping experience from end to end.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VWe had a problem with the igniter on our stove, it stopped working.  We called American Home Shield and they assigned A-1 Accurate to come out to complete the repair.  They were able to identify the problem within a few minutes and informed me that they had to special order a part.\u000a\u000aIt took 2 weeks for the part to come in and for them to install it.  It didn't take them too long to get it done, now the stove works great.\u000a\u000aOverall, a pretty good experience.

VLocated less than a mile away from my house, this is the most convenient auto parts store for me.  I've been here many times in the past.  It's not as big as a Pep Boys, but carries all of the basics.\u000a\u000aSince the weather has been cold & rainy in Vegas, it was time to change my windshield wiper blades.\u000a\u000aI stopped by today to pick up a pair for my car.  One blade was $8.99 the other was $7.99.....two different sized blades on my car.  Using their car fitting guide, I was able to find my blade sizes and was in/out in less than 5 minutes.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet I will.

VJust got back from shopping at this Albertson's.  It was my first trip here....it's kind of out of my way but is on the route home from my colleague's house, so I decided to give it a shot after I left his house.  It's getting 5 Stars from me.....here's why:\u000a\u000a- It's new & very clean.\u000a\u000a- It's large and has a good selection of food items.\u000a\u000a- The alcohol section is larger than most supermarkets and offers a larger selection of wine than most.\u000a\u000a- They are the only supermarket I've found that carries my favorite Hot Sauce.....Melinda's.  I bought 3 bottles today to stock up.\u000a\u000a- Their carts are clean and in good condition.  Nothing makes me more frustrated when I'm at the grocery store than junky shopping carts.\u000a\u000a- They have self-checkout registers.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet your Hot Sauce I will!

For that, I gave it the Star back....still a 5 Star joint in my book.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Absolutely!

That's one of my favorite things about B-Dubs is the FREE WiFi.\u000a\u000aI'll order a 6 pack or dozen Boneless Wings and just work away.  It's really hard not to have a Beer or two while studying so I'll cave every once in a while and grab a Blue Moon.\u000a\u000aThe staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is great for hanging out.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 75%

VWent here for lunch today to meet a colleague.  I ordered the Burger with Cheddar Cheese & Jalapenos with a side of Fries.  The food came out fast and as ordered.\u000a\u000aThe Burger was good....not great.  The Fries were outstanding.  The service was good and my meeting went well.\u000a\u000aOverall it was a good experience, but for $14 I've had better Burgers.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I usually have business lunches here because of it's proximity to the Strip & Convention Center.....so I will probably return.  I wouldn't take the family here for dinner....just not good enough for the price in my opinion.

VI stayed here for a few days during a recent trip to Vegas.  It was my first time staying in the hotel.  Here's a breakdown of my experience:\u000a\u000aPros\u000a+ The rooms are awesome...spacious, comfortable beds, quality linens & toiletries, kitchenette.\u000a\u000a+ Free WiFi.\u000a\u000a+ Lobby Bar is a great place to unwind for a drink or three.\u000a\u000a+ Customer service was great during out trip.  Kudos to the front desk, bartenders, and bellmen who assisted us.\u000a\u000a+ Great views.  You can see the Strip from one side of the tower and the Vegas Valley from the other side.\u000a\u000aCons\u000a- The biggest negative was the fact that after 7 am or so, the freakin' trains start to run through the city and blast their horns at all of the train crossings.....there's at least 3 or 4 crossings in Vegas and you can hear that train through the windows and walls of your room.  If you're a light sleeper or bothered by this kind of noise, you can forget about sleeping in.\u000a\u000a- The valet parking is inadequate.  The waiting area outside to pick up your car was not meant for a full blown hotel.  It was meant for a condo tower....so it's not made to handle the constant in/out volume of a large Vegas hotel.  It also doesn't handle the cabs, limos, and shuttles very well either.  So you end up waiting for your car inside the lobby and try to see through the lanes of other cars to pick yours up when it's ready.\u000a\u000aThe 2 negative items are big ones for me and that's why this place gets 3 Stars in my opinion....otherwise, it could've earned 4 Stars.\u000a\u000aThere's also no casino at this hotel....which can be a positive or a negative to some people.  I'm indifferent.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VWas going to go to Cabo Cantina at Santa Fe Station for lunch today with the family, but it was closed and didn't open until 3 pm.  So what did I do?  I jumped on Yelp to find an alternative.  What I found was Buzz BBQ which was only 1.5 miles away.\u000a\u000aFood - There is a ton of selections to choose from (see pics for menu).  I was going to order the Beef Brisket sandwich and the Pulled Pork sandwich, but the waitress convinced me to try the Tornado sandwich....which has Beef Brisket, Pulled Pork, and Sausage in it.  The sandwich is huge.  I ordered Fries on the side with Blue Cheese Dressing for dip.\u000a\u000aThere are 2 sauces on the table.....Hot & Mild.  The Hot is not really that hot at all.....kind of disappointing as I like spicy BBQ sauce.  They get a -1 for that.  They also get another -1 for charging us $.50 ea for the Ranch and Blue Cheese dressing for our Fries.....I think that kind of stuff is petty....especially since our sandwiches were $11 a pop.\u000a\u000aThe Tornado sandwich was very tasty.  I can taste the flavor of each meat.  The bun was just ok though....I think they could do better than that.  Even though they didn't have a spicy sauce, I liked how they allowed you to dress your sandwich with the sauce of your choice....I hate it when places drench their sandwiches in sauce.  \u000a\u000aService - The service was fast and the server was friendly, +1.\u000a\u000aAtmosphere - The restaurant is in an outdoor shopping mall....they have it decked out in Western decor, but it's not really convincing....kind of cheesy actually....but that doesn't matter to me with a restaurant of this caliber.\u000a\u000aWe had a clean table & booth and they gave us a roll of paper towels just in case....which is nice touch.\u000a\u000aI would have given this place 4 Stars, but the lack of a true spicy sauce and the petty charge for the dressings made me drop them to 3 Stars.  I still prefer them to the Memphis chain that's in town.\u000a\u000aWill I come back?  Sure, when I'm in the mood for BBQ.  Next time, I will bring my own sauce....lol.

VI finally got a chance to stop by The Office to grab a bite and have a few drinks with friends.  I've heard about this place for a while now and was excited to give it a try.  After browsing the menu, I decided to order:\u000a\u000aCheeseburger Sliders, $9\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-office-bar-and-grill-scottsdale?select=Dl5Mp7LBNsJuTYL86474Ow#Dl5Mp7LBNsJuTYL86474Ow\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-office-bar-and-grill-scottsdale?select=7k_p0AlaVqz7gEgHBTZSzA#7k_p0AlaVqz7gEgHBTZSzA\u000a\u000aPotato Skins, $7\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-office-bar-and-grill-scottsdale?select=EmdOjMK5dPaoPUf8pSpQRg#EmdOjMK5dPaoPUf8pSpQRg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-office-bar-and-grill-scottsdale?select=DFOZF33MjR4lzPkqmb4OFg#DFOZF33MjR4lzPkqmb4OFg\u000a\u000aThe bartenders here are really friendly and the food prices are reasonable.  I also like the large bar top, where you can easily eat your meal and have a few drinks without feeling like you're cramped.  There's also plenty of large TV's above the bar, perfect for watching a game.\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait the food came out.  I tried the Potato Skins first.  They were pretty good...not the best I've ever had, but above average.  Next, I tried the Sliders which were very good as well.  The Fries that came with the Sliders were ok....the Sweet Potato Fries were definitely the highlight between the 2 Fries.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a good experience which exceeded my expectations.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VThis is rapidly becoming one of my favorite places to go when we go to the Strip.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a- The vibe.  The place attracts a younger crowd that has a lot of energy.\u000a\u000a- Bars & Lounges.  They have a wide variety of bars and lounges.  On a recent visit we spent some time at the Heart Bar....a DJ was playing and the drinks were reasonable....$8 for a glass of Wine.\u000a\u000a- Miracle Mile Shopping mall.  This mall is pretty cool with some unique shops and dining options.  The Earl of Sandwich is at the South end of the mall.....one of my favorite Sandwich shops in town.\u000a\u000a- Restaurants.  From cheap, food court type food to nice sit-down restaurants, there is something for everyone here.  One of the highlights is Pink's from Los Angeles which is known for their Hot Dogs.\u000a\u000a- Easy access to the Strip.  The distance between the property and the Strip is short, making it easy to get to/from the Strip.\u000a\u000aThere are a few negatives to the place......the parking situation sucks.  The parking garage is at the rear of the property and the walk to the casino is pretty far.  Valet parking is underground and is also a big pain the ass.  This is a function of very poor design which has plagued this hotel since they opened.  The layout of the casino floor is very confusing....it's difficult to figure out where you are located and how to get around.  The mall is a little confusing as well.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You can count on it.

VI came here to attend a breakfast meeting in the conference area.  The group hosting it had one of the large ballrooms setup and the lobby was the pre-function space.  Coffee and Tea was setup for the attendees with a nice selection and quality of Teas.  \u000a\u000aOnce the meeting started, we headed into the room and sat down for breakfast.  The banquet staff here was very friendly and did a good job.  The food was served hot and fresh.  The meeting started and went off without any issues.  It was a great all around experience.  I'd like to come back and try it for a stay-cation.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VAhh....51's baseball.....my family and I have been coming here every year to watch the 51's play a few games.  We love to watch minor league baseball and Cashman Field is a decent place to watch a game.\u000a\u000aThere is really no bad seat in the house.  We've sat in every level and corner of this place and not once did we complain about our seats.  That doesn't mean this place is perfect though.....here are a few things that prevent this from being a 5 Star experience:\u000a\u000a- Parking.  I hate that most of the parking is located 100 ft above the ground level in an elevated parking lot.  Yes, there are some lower level spots, but 1/2 of those are reserved and the other 1/2 get taken very quickly.....so it's not worth driving all the way down there.\u000a\u000a- Food quality.  The food options here are great....Nachos, Philly Cheesesteak Sandwiches, Bratwurst, Polish Dogs...etc.  However, half of the time they're not cooked properly (too cold), or the Bread/Chips taste stale.  I wish they could get this together, because when it is on....it tastes great.  It's failing in the execution somehow.\u000a\u000a- Post game traffic management.  There is none.....which means the parking lot is a free for all.  At least the Thomas & Mack have people directing the traffic post-game....here, everyone just makes a mad dash for the exit and of course everyone turns into a road rager because there's no respect for each other.  A few off duty cops working the exit would help this out tremendously.\u000a\u000aOverall, we enjoy the games here and will come back again.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VAfter getting some business done at the Fedex-Kinko's next door, I headed to Golden Spoon to grab some Froyo.\u000a\u000aIt was a totally spontaneous decision and when I make those types of decisions it's usually not in my best interests....so I was having second thoughts about indulging in some Foyo Awesomeness.....then I saw the huge Nutritional Info board explaining the calories and other key facts of the Froyo.....88 Calories per serving huh?  hmm....I asked the girl how many servings was in a Small.....she said about 1.....so, I said how about the Regular?  She said about 2.5.....I did the Math quickly and decided that 216 or so Calories isn't going to kill me......so I ordered a Cookies & Cream w/Raspberry Cheesecake no toppings.\u000a\u000aAfter the first bite I was very pleased with myself for justifying this to myself....ha!  I enjoyed every last bite!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Ummm....of course!

VAnother  5 Star golf course in my book.....if you get a chance to play Dragon Ridge, make sure you take your time and enjoy everything this course has to offer.\u000a\u000aThe course is tucked atop the most exclusive area of McDonald's Ranch in Henderson.  The golf course is very challenging and the elevations and valleys will fool your eyes into believing the distances are not what they appear to be.  Despite it's tough layout, it's a very fun course.  The views of the Las Vegas Valley are amazing!\u000a\u000aThe greens are very fast on this course, so bring your A-Game and make sure you hit the practice green before you step up to the 1st Tee!  If you play this course during the Summer, make sure you buy some water to bring with you during the round, because it gets really hot!  I'm accustomed to playing in the desert and normally don't have any issues with playing in 100+ degree heat, but this course for some reason must have a magnifying glass hovering above it.....it was a scorcher!\u000a\u000aThe food in the clubhouse is very good.....what you would expect for an exclusive private golf club.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  The next opportunity I get!

VNice little burger type cafe on the corner of Robindale and Jones.  I had the sliders and enjoyed them.  They were a little small compared to many of the sliders that you see in restaurants nowadays.....but the portion was fine.  All their burgers are made fresh and hand pressed daily.  I will definitely go back and try some of their other offerings.  The Pastrami Sub looked good as well as the Ortega Burger, which my friend ordered and said was wonderful.  They also have Criss-Cut Fries, which are not usually available in most restaurants.

VNormally, I get a burrito from Blue Burrito then head over to my favorite watering hole, Corcoran's.  However, I didn't have much time this trip, so i stopped by Jose Cuervo Tequileria to have a beer and Blue Burrito.\u000a\u000aFood - This time I had their veggie burrito.  It was beans, rice, lettuce, tomato, sour cream, cheese, and guacamole.  They put way too much lettuce in this burrito.  Normally I have a steak or chicken burrito....but opted for the veggie.  While it tasted good, the lettuce drowned out the other flavors.\u000a\u000aAtmosphere - It's a fun bar to hang out at.  Plenty of seats and FREE Wifi.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Yes, but probably won't order the veggie next time.

VThis review is for the Lobby Bar only.  I am at the Platinum Hotel at least 5 or 6 times a year for Toastmasters meetings.  Before and sometimes after the meetings, a few of us will get together at the Lobby Bar for a few drinks.\u000a\u000aThe bartenders and waitresses here are really friendly and attentive to you.  I've only been here once or twice when it was really busy....and that was during the NFL football season on Monday Nights.  The rest of the time, it's not too busy around Happy Hour.\u000a\u000aSpeaking of their Happy Hour, that's the best part of this place.  1/2 Off drinks.  Last visit I had 2 Blue Moons and the total was $4.50!  What?!  I can't believe it!  That's what has me coming back.\u000a\u000aThe decor is modern and the furniture is very comfortable.  It has a lounge atmosphere and it's a great place for a business meeting.  In the middle of the day, there is nobody there so you can have the place to yourself.  It's truly a hidden gem in Vegas.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet!

VI heard about Jollibee by reading a Harvard Business Review case on the company and was interested to try it out for myself.  I was surprised to discover two locations in Vegas.  I gave the Seafood City location a try.\u000a\u000aI knew it was a Filipino fast food joint that had food that catered to that demographic.  Since I'm an "white-washed" Pacific Islander, my taste in food leans more towards a traditional American taste than the islands....so, I knew I was in for an adventure.\u000a\u000aI decided to sample a little bit of everything.  I had the Shanghai Rolls, 99 cent Corned Beef Sandwich, 99 cent French Fries, and a Champ Burger.  To wash it down I had a bottle of Water.  Since I ordered to eat in the restaurant, I was issued a number and waited for my order to be delivered.  The order came out in two batches since it took a while to cook my Champ Burger.\u000a\u000aThe Corned Beef Sandwich was very small....about the size of a Slider.  It didn't have much flavor to it....kind of bland to me.\u000a\u000aThe Shanghai Rolls were very good.  They were tiny, pinky sized Rolls that had the texture of Lumpia.  They were pretty good but you didn't get much for 99 cents.\u000a\u000aThe French Fries were just ok, nothing special.\u000a\u000aThe Champ Burger was a mess.  It was very sloppy with the Mayo and Ketchup running down the sides of the Burger.  It has a different taste to it....I don't know what it is....but it doesn't taste like a regular Burger.  I didn't like it at all.\u000a\u000aThe joint was really busy and had at least 10 people in line during my entire visit, which was around 2 pm.  That's pretty impressive.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Probably not, it wasn't for me.

VWalking down the Las Vegas Strip is not fun between Mandalay Bay and Excalibur....that's why I'm a big fan of this tram.  Whenever friends visit, Mandalay Bay is a must stop.  On the rare occasion they want to also visit the Excalibur (not by my recommendation) we take the tram.  It's FREE and it beats walking all the way to the front of the property.  It's especially great during the hot Summer months.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VA collection of Art, Music, Food, Drink, and good times.....First Friday is a monthly event held in the Downtown Las Vegas arts district.  I'm not sure if you can call it a 'district', but it's the closest thing Vegas has to what outsiders and new residents refer to as 'culture'.  The streets are blocked off and food vendors, art vendors, galleries, and music stages pepper the surrounding area......think of a massive block party or small festival.\u000a\u000aI enjoy coming down here with the family from time to time to check out the scene.  It gets really crowded, so it's difficult to really appreciate the art if you're into a more quiet and calm setting like I am.  One First Friday I saw a guy smoking inside the Arts Factory gallery.....that's crazy, the smoke can ruin the artwork!  Of course, nobody said anything to him.....and when I mentioned it, he gave me a "who the F___ are you?!" look and walked away.  *sigh*  Some people come to First Friday for the party and not the art.....that's cool, but not really my style.\u000a\u000aThere's a lot of local musicians represented down here and a few stages where they perform.....it's kind of cool to see local bands perform since there aren't too many places in Vegas to listen to them.  There's usually a few food trucks and concession stands as well as restaurants down here.  We rarely eat at the event though as the lines can get very long and we don't really enjoy our meals when there's nowhere to sit and enjoy the food.  Definitely worth a trip if you've never been before though.\u000a\u000aSome TIPS:\u000a\u000a- Parking is very difficult to find.  There is paid valet parking at the Arts Factory on the corner of Charleston & Main St, but it fills up quickly.  Street parking close to the event is sometimes hard to find too.....my recommendation is to get there early or be patient to find a spot.\u000a\u000a- Wear comfortable shoes.  The First Friday event covers a few city blocks, so if you want to get the full experience be prepared to walk.\u000a\u000a- Bathrooms are a premium.  Because of the large crowds, expect long waits at the restroom.  The Arts Factory has one, some of the smaller galleries around the area won't let you use their private bathroom....keep that in mind.\u000a\u000a- If you bring your kids, make sure you keep an eye on them.  It's easy to lose them in the crowd and remember that you're on the streets of Downtown Las Vegas.....not a cool place to lose your kid at night.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a pretty cool experience if you know what to expect.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VWas in the area and was hungry for Mexican Food, so I stopped by this Chipotle to grab some lunch.  It's a typical Chipotle.....if you've never been to one before here's a breakdown:\u000a\u000aYou select your menu item...ie Burrito, Taco, Quesadilla.  Then you instruct the employee making your meal on what ingredients you'd like on/in your item.....ie Pinto/Black Beans, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Salsa etc.\u000a\u000aI decided to go for a Chicken Burrito w/Pinto Beans, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Pico de Gallo, Hot Sauce, Rice.  To wash it down, I got a bottle of Izzle Clementine Soda.\u000a\u000aThe Burrito is huge and was delicious.  I really like their Hot Sauce at Chipotle, it has a nice kick to it.  I devoured the entire Burrito, then enjoyed my Izzle.\u000a\u000aOverall Value - I always get great value for my money at Chipotle.\u000aWill I return?  I like this location, I'm sure I'll be back.

VAlthough this mall is extremely far away from my neighborhood, I enjoy coming here for events they have.  In the past couple of years I've attended at least 3 or 4 events here.  Most recently, I attended the Battle Swagger B-Boy Competition last weekend.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyioBGi083o\u000a\u000aHere are the Pros/Cons of the mall:\u000a\u000aPros\u000a- Easy to access from the US 95 freeway.  You can get to it from Galleria Dr or Sunset Rd.\u000a- Parking is easy.  Most of the events are held in the area near the Food Court, so park around back where the Food Court is for easy access in/out of events.\u000a- They have a decent selection of stores.  One store they have that the other Malls don't have is Dick's Sporting Goods.\u000a\u000aCons\u000a- It's getting run down a little bit.  The crowd that hangs out there is sometimes sketchy.\u000a- The Food Court blows.....some malls have improved their offerings, this one is stuck in the 90's with their food offerings.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  For events and to shop at Dick's Sporting Goods.

VLocated at the Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino, the Miracle Mile Shops are a pretty cool place to go shopping.  There are a ton of stores and the Earl of Sandwich (one of my favorite Sammie shops) is located there.  The food selection is pretty good too.  There's a food court and a ton of restaurants in the mall.....something for everybody.\u000a\u000aThe only negative for me is that the layout of the mall is confusing.  Only the shops that are near the parking garage are easy to remember the location....the location of the rest of them don't make sense to me.  It's probably because it has been remodeled a few times and the design has evolved over the years.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's not too bad of a shopping experience.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VDropped by for lunch with a friend.  I love the vibe an decor here....it's very modern and chic.  I ordered a Triple Grilled Cheese Sandwich (Provolone, American, and Cheddar Cheese on Griddled Texas Toast, $7.95 & Tomatoes, $.95).  It comes with a complimentary side of Caesar Salad....bonus!\u000a\u000aThe Grilled Cheese Sandwich was awesome!  The thick Texas Toast was griddled perfectly....not too burnt, but not too soft....and the combination of Cheeses was just right.....the Tomato provided a nice, juicy & sweet flavor to the Sammie!  Next time, I'll also add Avocado to the Sammie for $.95 more.\u000a\u000aOur server was great too.....patient with us as we talked and browsed the menu.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was an awesome dining experience.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VI love coming to Wally's for lunch.  It's a great place to bring colleagues and clients for a bite to eat.  The food is good and atmosphere is perfect to fit in a working lunch.  One of my fav's for lunch is the Frisco Burger, $11.95.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wallys-pub-and-grill-scottsdale?select=0eueAUaNpi_w0YDj6-Otnw#0eueAUaNpi_w0YDj6-Otnw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wallys-pub-and-grill-scottsdale?select=OHjcUgqlSv-tZ-eu4wglsQ#OHjcUgqlSv-tZ-eu4wglsQ\u000a\u000aIt can get a little sloppy on you if your not careful, but it's worth it.  If you are feeling adventurous and don't worry about calories, try any one of their S'macs....it's their version of Mac 'n Cheese....ridiculously awesome.  However, be prepared to be in a food coma if you decide to have one of those!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VI've lived in Vegas for 18 yrs now and one of the places that hasn't changed much over that time is the Fantastik Swapmeet.  Located at the intersection of Decatur & Oakey, the Swapmeet is a collection of vendors that sell everything from T-Shirts to Snakes.  Yes, there's an exotic pet vendor here!\u000a\u000aIt's fun to come here and window shop.  I rarely buy anything here because most of the stuff is of cheap quality.  Plus, you have no recourse if something breaks or doesn't fit properly.  I do come here to have one of the watch vendors replace a dead watch battery.  It only costs $7 to get a new battery, so I always come here for that service.  \u000a\u000aI also enjoy the "As Seen On TV" vendor.  Over the years I've purchased more stuff I didn't need from this vendor than any of the others here.  The one I actually use often is the Ginsu Knife knockoff.....hey it cuts well/stays sharp and it was cheap ($10)!\u000a\u000aOne of the more interesting things about this place is the carpeting.  They've carpeted the floor with old casino carpeting.....so you'll see various carpeting from old casinos like the Fitzgerald's and 4 Queens on the floor.  It's kind of like the Neon Museum but for carpeting.\u000a\u000aThere are food vendors here, but I don't recommend eating here.  I've had Hot Dogs and Sandwiches here a long time ago, but it's really not worth it unless you're super-hungry.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's an interesting place to visit and worth the small price of admission ($1).

VOnce upon a time, this place rocked.....always packed with people and had a great vibe.  Then, inexplicably, it became a topless strip club....wth?  Where were all the partiers who wanted to sing along with Tommy and his band go?  Who knows.\u000a\u000aNow, it's no longer a topless strip club, but it's lost the momentum it once had.  Which is too bad because it was a really fun place to go to meet up with friends, have a few drinks, shoot some pool, have some food, and sing along with the band.  Well, not really sing along, but the bands were so much fun (think Jimmy Buffet style) that you couldn't help but sing along with your drunk friends.\u000a\u000aI recently stopped by the joint to see what it was like now.  I walked into the place and it just didn't feel the same.  It's the same building and not much as changed inside the bar, but it was missing the people that made it fun.  It was replaced with other people, but it just didn't seem right.  I had a Beer and left.\u000a\u000aDespite losing it's luster and momentum, this place is one of the best places to be during a weekend that Jimmy Buffet is performing in Vegas.  Although Jimmy has opened up a joint at the Flamingo, many Parrot Heads still come here.  Before Margaritaville opened up, this was Parrot Head heaven during those weekends.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Only during a Jimmy Buffet concert weekend.

VCame here for lunch and to do some Studying & Work.  A friend of mine highly recommended this place because of the relaxed atmosphere and FREE Wifi.  I've passed it 100's of times and have never been here.  This was my first visit.\u000a\u000aSince it was lunchtime, I was hungry and ordered the Italian Combo Sandwich with Kettle Chips & a Bottle of Water.  The menu is simple and you don't get to pick the toppings of your Sandwich....so that was a bummer to me....I like to select my toppings.  Oh well, no big deal.  On a positive note....they post the # of calories for each menu item....that was helpful....1,040 calories for my Sandwich + 180 Calories for the Chips....I was at 1,220 for the meal...not bad.\u000a\u000aThe place is a Bakery and had a ton of fresh Bread & Pastries....all very tempting, but I didn't want to pass out from food coma....I had to get some work and homework done.\u000a\u000aI settled into a small table and setup the wireless on my laptop while I waited for my food.  It didn't take long and the food was ready.  I dove into the Sandwich....the Bread was pretty good and the proportion of Meat and toppings was good too.  It was good, but not great.\u000a\u000aAfter lunch I moved over to a plush chair in the corner and got to work....got some work done and hung out for a couple of hours.  It was very comfortable.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I think I found a new place to add to my FREE Wifi work rotation....of course!

I recently came to this location and ordered:\u000a\u000aCheeseburger Animal Style, $2.25\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n-out-burger-tempe?select=K7mA8k4ZMqZ0ga-DN0-wdQ#K7mA8k4ZMqZ0ga-DN0-wdQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n-out-burger-tempe?select=EUJfvJBibUcaWvjeggno5w#EUJfvJBibUcaWvjeggno5w\u000a\u000aFrench Fries Animal Style, $3.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n-out-burger-tempe?select=MocfGFJGvCqJYX4_rR_7VQ#MocfGFJGvCqJYX4_rR_7VQ\u000a\u000aSmall Soda, $1.40\u000a\u000aThe Cheeseburger was perfect....had all of the flavor that I've come to love about In-N-Out.  The Animal Fries on the other hand were terrible....they were cold and chewy.  Unbelievable, because they cook it fresh....they must've left this order on the counter while they finished by Burger instead of giving me a fresh order of Animal Fries.  It was a little disappointing because I normally have a 4 or 5 Star experience at an In-N-Out.\u000a\u000aOh well, maybe I caught them on a bad day?  \u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

VI love this place.  We have one in Vegas and I was pleased to see one out here.  It is massive and I enjoy coming in here to browse the boats and the outdoor gear.  \u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rw8YDgz69vqdeu-oLR4W8Q?select=APVssPpowbz3Lb0ob4SAUA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rw8YDgz69vqdeu-oLR4W8Q?select=iwbx1a-HRGvIR4fm8qHJhQ\u000aI'm not really into the outdoors, but still enjoy window shopping some of this stuff.\u000a\u000aI am about to go on a camping trip....(I can't believe I just typed that)...and was looking for a 0 degree sleeping bag.  While I was looking for that, I browsed the Golf equipment and the bow & arrows.  \u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rw8YDgz69vqdeu-oLR4W8Q?select=Img8wGILm74mjpwVK-AeGA\u000aI want to take archery lessons soon and wanted to price the equipment.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's always a blast to shop at a Bass Pro Shops.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VWas shopping for folders, a folder box, and a binder.  I was shocked to see how expensive office supplies were.....$10.99 for 100 manila folders, $9.99 for a box, and $8.99 for a 1 1/2" binder!  Damn!\u000a\u000aDespite my perception of high prices, it was a pleasant shopping experience.  The store is well organized and I found what I was looking for within minutes & without assistance.  The checkout process was smooth and easy.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Only if I have to.

VOne of my family's favorite restaurants for Mediterranean Food in Vegas.  We used to live nearby, so now when we visit we have to drop by and have one of our fav's.  It's cheap, convenient, and fast.  We enjoy these dishes:\u000a\u000aGreek Salad, $5.95\u000aCombo Platter Appetizer (Hummus, Tabouli, Babaganoush, Greek Salad, Dolmades, Falafel), $10.95\u000aSpanakopita, $8.25\u000aTraditional Gyro, $7.75\u000a\u000aAll of the food is very good and authentic.  This place can get very busy during peak lunch and dinner hours.  We like to go later than normal so we can find a seat and enjoy our meal.  It's also great to order it to go if you don't feel like dining in.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VThanks to Groupon we found this place.  It's a nice Mexican joint in North Scottsdale.  Tucked away in the corner of the shopping center, there's no way I could've found it on my own.\u000a\u000aAfter browsing the menu, I ordered:\u000aQueso Crisp, $5\u000aMonster Nachos, $10\u000a\u000aThe Queso Crisp was pretty good.  Kind of hard to screw up a Cheese Crisp, so I wasn't expecting anything less than good.  The Monster Nachos was very good.  I am a self-proclaimed Nacho-lover...and I'm a fan of their Nachos!\u000a\u000aThe service was so/so on the night we went...they were packed, so it was understandable.  Overall, pretty good experience.\u000a\u000a**TIP** - the parking lot can get crazy packed on weekends, so park in the first spot you find.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

VAny restaurant with 4.5 Stars after hundreds of ratings is going to attract my attention.  Today was the day I went to give this place a shot.\u000a\u000aI took my son along.  We decided that we were going to order an Original Sandwich & an Italian Sandwich.....that we we could split each of them and give them both a try.\u000a\u000aWhen we arrived, the place was packed.  However, this restaurant knows how to handle volume.  The ordering & payment process was smooth.\u000a\u000aI was surprised to see the selection of Chips, Fruit, Beer & Wine, and Muffins & Pastries that were available.  We found a 2 Top table and waited for our number to be buzzed.\u000a\u000aAfter about 10 minutes, our pager buzzed and I went to pick up our order.\u000a\u000aThe Sandwiches are hot & toasted.  I eagerly bit into the Original Sandwich (Roast Beef, Cheddar Cheese, & Creamy Horseradish Sauce).  The Bread was toasted just right and the Roast Beef was tender, it melted in my mouth.  The bite of the Cheddar Cheese & Creamy Horseradish went very well with the meat & bread.....it was like heaven!  I couldn't get enough.....I wish I ordered a full sandwich.\u000a\u000aSo, I couldn't wait to eat my half of the Italian (Salami, Capicola, Roasted Ham, Mortadella, Mozzarella Cheese, Roma Tomato, and Zesty Italian Dressing).....again, it was toasted just right.  This sandwich also burst with flavor on my taste buds......oh man, I think I hit the jackpot!!!\u000a\u000aThis place was off the hook!  For once, a restaurant lived up to the hype!  5 Stars in my book.\u000a\u000aThe only knock for me is that it is very inconvenient for a local to get in/out of Planet Hollywood just to get a sandwich.\u000a\u000aWill I come back?  Abso-freakin'-lutely!

VMet a colleague here for lunch recently.  Located inside the Firesky Resort, this restaurant is a nice little Italian joint that has a nice view of their pool and courtyard.\u000a\u000aWe came here on a Wed around 12 pm.  There were only 2 or 3 tables when we arrived.  We sat down and ordered lunch:\u000a\u000aClub Sandwich w/Fries, $13\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/taggia-scottsdale?select=U586HjZ5vZnKRQkcIO9ojg#U586HjZ5vZnKRQkcIO9ojg\u000a\u000aSausage Pizza, $13\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/taggia-scottsdale?select=HKTmINBakTZ14pnh1lqDmw#HKTmINBakTZ14pnh1lqDmw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/taggia-scottsdale?select=SME4BCsSKX8f_bHCcRcMeg#SME4BCsSKX8f_bHCcRcMeg\u000a\u000aThe food was really good.  I had the Pizza....it was huge!  Very large for a lunch portion.  It could easily feed 2 people.  Luckily, it isn't heavy.  The Crust is thin and toppings are not heavy.  It's cooked crispy without asking for it that way, so be prepared for that....if you don't like it crispy, I recommend ordering something else.  The flavor was excellent, especially the Sausage which was amazing.\u000a\u000aMy colleague had the Club Sandwich and he said it was very good.\u000a\u000aThe food and ambiance earns 4 Stars. The service on the other hand gets 2 Stars.  Despite there being only a few tables....it never got packed....the service was very slow.  It took a long time for our food to come out, then it took 20 min for the server to pick up the bill after he dropped it off.  Slow service is a big no-no for lunch....you have to get people in/out quickly.  Luckily, our schedules were clear and we got some work done over lunch, so we made the best out of it.\u000a\u000aI may have caught them on a bad day....might back to give it another chance.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 65%

VHad lunch with my Mom here last week.  It has been over a year since our last visit.  It is a restaurant/video poker bar.  The restaurant is on the left side of the building.  We were pleased to see that it was still kept well and clean.  Many video poker bars in Vegas go downhill rapidly.\u000a\u000aAfter taking our drink orders, the server told us the Lunch Special was Buy One Burger, Get One FREE.  We decided to go for the Special and ordered a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and a Montana Peppercorn Burger.\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait the server brought out our food.  I should have paid closer attention to the menu because the Montana Peppercorn Burger was served open-face with Gravy smothered all over the Burger & Fries.....not exactly what I wanted, but that was my bad.  Mom wasn't that hungry, so she was nice enough to trade with me....so I had the BBQ Bacon Burger.  The Burger was pretty good, not great....the Onion Rings that were served as toppings for the Burger were great.  The Steak Fries that came with the Burger were awesome.....they were cooked just right so that they weren't too soft or soggy.....which happens a lot with Steak Fries....they made it just right.\u000a\u000aMom couldn't finish the Gravy smothered Burger, so I had a couple of bites....I didn't really care for it....I'm not a fan of Gravy unless it's with Turkey & Stuffing.  I could barely taste the Peppercorn Burger under that Gravy and Grilled Onions.\u000a\u000aOverall, it  was an ok lunch.  Will I return?  Yes, but not for the Gravy Burger.

VAfter living here for 3 yrs, I recently discovered that it's easier to get downtown using the 51 Freeway instead of the 101/202/10 route.  It's counterintuitive because I have to go in the opposite direction on the 101 for a short distance.  However, it's much faster, especially during rush hour.  The HOV lane is the best way to travel during rush hour.  Thankfully, I rarely drive alone during rush hour.\u000a\u000aThe freeway is 65 mph for most of the distance until you get within a few miles of the 10, then it drops to 55 mph.  You have to watch for that otherwise you can get popped for speeding. \u000a\u000aAs long as this remains convenient to use, I'll continue to drive it.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VSnoop Dogg!  I went to the fair for the first time ever to see Snoop.  He performed in the arena and there was around 10,000 people in attendance.  He rocked the stage for around 45 minutes.  The crowd was in a frenzy the entire show.\u000a\u000aIt was a lot of fun.  I didn't have much time to go and do the normal carnival stuff....we were in/out for the concert.  It was pretty cool and I'd definitely come back to see another concert.  The only knock on this place is that it's old....but when the music is on, it doesn't matter.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VThis place reminds me of the Irvine Spectrum.  I like it a lot.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a+ It's an outdoor mall.  I like walking around in the sun.  When it gets hot, there are tons of misters to keep you cool.\u000a\u000a+ Easy parking.  There's plenty of parking around the mall.\u000a\u000a+ Easy access to freeways.  The 101 & 202 freeways are very close.\u000a\u000a+ Great selection of stores, food court, and restaurants.\u000a\u000a+ The nightlife is pretty cool.  There are a few bars/restaurants where people hang out and party.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a fun place with a great vibe.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VI really want to like this stadium, I do.  It's just that it's too outdated for me.  The food selection is limited.  But I think the worst part about it is the lack of vibe during tailgates.  Also, despite the huge size of the alumni base in Phoenix, they don't come out to support ASU.  When I attended the Oregon/ASU game this year, there were plenty of empty seats...!  How can this place be empty when ASU had only 1 loss at the Ducks were in the Top 5 in the country?\u000a\u000aWatching the Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl was pretty cool, too bad the stadium wasn't full.  I hope the new renovations they have planned spruce it up a bit.\u000a\u000aI do love College Football, so I'll definitely be back.  \u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VThanks to Groupon, we discovered this place last Summer and have been back several times.  Located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, it's near all of the Western Shops and knicknack stores....a great place to grab a bite if you're walking around and doing some shopping.\u000a\u000aHighlight of some items we've ordered here:\u000a\u000aLos Nachos (Chips, Black Beans, Cheese, Pico de Gallo, Jalapenos, Crema Mexicana, Grilled Chicken), $9.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ja4stXdNYr39u5CZHMNtjw?select=O-yvBcKbgwf9Do-vpgr5xQ#O-yvBcKbgwf9Do-vpgr5xQ\u000a\u000aChicken Tortilla Soup (Bowl), $5.50\u000a\u000aSteak Fajitas, $15.95\u000a\u000a3 Taco Special (any 3 Tacos), $12.95\u000aI've ordered this several times.  Some of the Tacos I've tried are:\u000a- Taco al Pastor\u000a- Shredded Beef Taco\u000a- Carne Asada Taco\u000a- Carnitas Taco\u000a- Pollo Asado Taco\u000a\u000aMy 2 favs on that list are the Carne Asada & the Taco al Pastor Tacos.\u000a\u000aOverall, the food is pretty good and the Margaritas are excellent.  We've only come here during lunchtime and the service is so/so.  Sometimes we get an experienced server and they're good.  Other times we get a young, inexperienced college student that has no clue and forgets to serve us our complimentary Chips & Salsa....that's happened on 2 visits.  The inconsistent service is what knocks them down from a 4 to a 3 Star for me.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

VGreat Rock n Roll radio station.  I've been listening to this station for years.  It's one of the few that hasn't changed formats and has always played Rock.  They have awesome giveaways for concerts and host pretty cool events throughout the year.  I like consistency and this station has it.

VWent to this location to meet a colleague for a drink.  Had their Hefeweizen.....it was good.  Not the best I've ever had.  i would say this review is incomplete because I only had a drink at the bar.  The staff was pretty friendly, but I didn't have anything to eat and we only hung out at the bar.  I will visit this location again in the future and provide a more detailed review.

VWhat can I say....I love this course!  It is a collection of 18 of Jack Nicklaus' favorite holes that he's designed.  I've played on several of the original golf courses that he used to recreate the holes here and I can tell you that they are spot on!  Besides the fact that you can see the Las Vegas Strip from the golf course, you feel like you are playing on the original hole!\u000a\u000aThe course is tucked away in one of Las Vegas' most exclusive communities, The Ridges.  It is always kept in spectacular shape and the staff who work here are friendly.  I like how you hit off of grass in the driving range which gives you better feel during practice.\u000a\u000aDuring the recession there are tons of deals to be had here and and green fees are affordable.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  No question about it!

VI've come here once to meet a client for lunch.  Located at the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall, it's a convenient place to meet up since it's located outside near the parking lot.\u000a\u000aI had the Cheeseburger Sliders, $9.50.  They were good, not great.  Enough to fill me up for lunch.  Service was good as well.\u000a\u000aFor some reason, this restaurant never pops into my mind when I'm thinking of a place to eat...hence the 3 Stars.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VStopped by last Saturday night with The Better Half to have a glass of Wine.  It was around 9 pm and the place was nearly packed.  We found a couple of seats at the bar and enjoyed the dance music the DJ was playing.  The music volume was just right; we could have a conversation without screaming at each other.  The glass of Wine was $8 for the house Cabernet, not bad for the Strip.  The vibe was good and the crowd was decent.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet.

VThe sister property of the Venetian, the Palazzo is one of our favorite places to go when we decide to go to the Strip.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a- We enjoy the food & beverage options here.  LAVO, Dos Caminos, and Double Helix are a few of our favorites.\u000a\u000a- Easy access to the self parking garage.  It's located just off Twain Ave, which is off the Strip.  It makes it easy for us locals to get in/out of the property.  We prefer to park here than at the Venetian.  We often park here and walk to the Venetian.\u000a\u000a- FREE Wifi on the casino floor.  Yes, you can connect on the casino floor for FREE!  This is very beneficial when there's a convention or meeting at the property and you need internet access.\u000a\u000a- The rooms here are spectacular and can be found for reasonable rates in this down economy.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet.

In addition to them, here are some additional reasons why I love this place:\u000a\u000a+ It's very convenient if you're attending a conference at the Sands Expo Center.\u000a\u000a+ The suites are awesome here.  Very large and comfortable.\u000a\u000a+ The cabanas at the pool are very large and comfortable.  Perfect for groups who want to hang out and lounge all day.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's one of my favorite places in Vegas.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VDecided to finally give this place a try.  It's been on my To Do List for a while now.  The menu is extensive and appetizing......I couldn't make up my mind.  Good thing our server, Rosemary, helped us out.  She pointed out that they had a $4.95 lunch menu and that I should try one of those items.  I looked at the lunch menu and decided for that price I'd order 2 items!\u000a\u000aI ordered the 1 Topping Thin Crust Personal Pizza w/Sausage ($4.95) and an Italian Beef Sandwich w/Fries ($4.95) with a side of Hot Giardiniera ($.50).\u000a\u000aThe food came out after a short wait.  I went for the Beef Sandwich first.....dipped it in a little Au Jus and added some Giardiniera.....after one bite, I WAS HOOKED!  This is some seriously good Chicago style Beef!  I'm sooo glad I ordered it!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA?select=AxzEEvoOb0DEaYNr8YaiVg\u000aThe Fries were pretty good....they're Crinkle Cut Fries and had the perfect amount of Salt added to it.\u000a\u000aNext up was the Sausage Pizza.  I ordered it 'well done' because I prefer my Pizza that way.  They obliged and it came out perfectly!  The Crust was nice and crispy and the Sausage was AMAZING!  Another score!  It reminded me of Fox's Pizza in the Southside of Chicago when my friend took me there.  The size of the Pizza is pretty good too for $4.95!  I'd guess it's around a 10" Pizza.  I was expecting something smaller....it exceeded my expectations.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was an awesome lunch.....good food and good times!  Rosemary, our server, was amazing and friendly.  I love going to places like this where people actually care about their customers.\u000a\u000aI can't wait to go back and try their Stuffed Pizza, Deep Dish Pizza, Chicago Hot Dog, and many many more things I saw on the menu!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VI've attended this event now for the past 3 yrs at Talking Stick Resort.  It has really grown into a large, fun event.  Here's why I like it:\u000a\u000a+ There's an area where designers have their products and designs on display so you can view their stuff and talk to them about it.\u000a\u000a+ People are super cool and are unique.  You really can't find a scene like this in the Phoenix area very often.\u000a\u000a+ The main stage area is open and airy.  It's outside with plenty of room.\u000a\u000a+ The lounge areas near the stage are cool and fun for hanging out and meeting new people.\u000a\u000a+ The afterparty on Saturday is a lot of fun.  Awards are given out to the best models of the show.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a good time.  Can't wait for next year.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VWas hungry after a workout session at 24 Hour Fitness, checked out Yelp for nearby restaurants and found this pizza place.  After reading a few reviews I decided to give it a try.\u000a\u000aPizza - There is some great pizza deals here. (see photos for menu)  The pizza is thin crust New York Style....I had the 2 Pepperoni Slice special.  The pizza was very good, but got greasy real fast.  I see why some people rated this low for delivery.....it would be soggy if it was delivered.  The pizza was good, not great....but good.\u000a\u000aWill I come back?  Probably, but it's not the first place I'd think of.

VThis place is easily one of my favorite Steakhouses in Arizona.  They blow me away every time I visit.  I'm a creature of habit when I find a great Steakhouse, so I tend to order the same thing every time.  Here's what I order here:\u000a\u000aWedge Salad w/Blue Cheese Dressing & Crumbles\u000a12 oz Bone-In Filet, $38\u000aGorgonzola Mac n Cheese, $12\u000a\u000aThe Wedge Salad is a big portion and I have to be careful every time I order it not to get full.  I usually split it with The Better Half.  I wish they had a 1/2 order available.\u000a\u000aThe Bone-in Filet is simply magnificent.  It's juicy and full of flavor.  The right amount of marbling and the bone gives this Steak unbelievable flavor....my mouth is watering as I'm typing this.\u000a\u000aThe Gorgonzola Mac n Cheese is a big portion for a side dish...plan to share or take home.  It's very creamy and rich....delicious.  It compliments the Filet well.\u000a\u000aThe servers here are top notch and always go the extra mile to ensure you have a good time.  If it wasn't so far from civilization (it's in Pinnacle Peak), we'd come here more often.\u000a\u000aPS - this is not a cheap restaurant.  If you can't afford to spend the money, don't come here....you'll be disappointed.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VEasily one of the best Sushi restaurants in Scottsdale, we come here every so often.  It can get busy during week...best day to come is Sunday, when it's slow and you get more personal attention.\u000a\u000aSome fav dishes I've had here are:\u000a\u000a12 oz Filet, $46\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roka-akor-scottsdale-4?select=s2yMVUm96Ovi4wVrb4FAZg#s2yMVUm96Ovi4wVrb4FAZg\u000aPremium Nigiri - Sashimi, $6 - $24\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roka-akor-scottsdale-4?select=Z7AaYrSD2y1bED0HBzf56A#Z7AaYrSD2y1bED0HBzf56A\u000aEdamame, $4.50\u000aGrilled Chicken Yakitori, $7.50\u000aDeluxe Sashimi Platter - Market Price\u000a\u000aThe atmosphere in the restaurant is very modern and upscale.  You definitely pay for it when the bill comes, but it's worth it in my opinion.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VI have some colleagues that work in the area and we'll meet here for lunch from time to time.  It's not the best Thai food in town, but their lunch menu is pretty cheap, you can find items around $5, and the service is not too bad.\u000a\u000aWas just here recently and it's still A-OK.....I had the Pad Thai.  It was good, but not great.....didn't leave me wanting more.  I come here mainly for the company.  Lunch was quick and our orders were accurate.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 30%

VThis was the 2nd Mastro's I've been to in the city.  My 1st experience was with their Pinnacle Peak location.  I was curious to see if the quality of the food and experience would hold up.....and yes it did!\u000a\u000aWe joined a group of friends here for dinner and they accommodated 10 of us near the bar area.  We were able to enjoy the live music throughout dinner.  \u000a\u000aOf course, I had to order my fav dishes here:\u000a\u000aWedge Salad\u000aBone-In Filet\u000aGorgonzola Mac 'n Cheese\u000a\u000aThe food was phenomenal, just like the other location.  The Wedge Salad is fresh and crisp....very refreshing.  The Bone-In Filet is simply out of this world....the Bone just adds so much flavor to it....yum!  The Gorgonzola Mac 'n Cheese is addicting and is worth the nuclear explosion of calories....I just can't say no to ordering it.\u000a\u000aThe service is outstanding and we were well taken care of.  Our party of 10 felt like we were at home because we were so comfortable and didn't have to worry about anything all night.  We put away 5 bottles of Wine and the server ensured that we didn't have an empty glass until we were ready.\u000a\u000aTip: The food prices are not cheap here...if you can't fade a large dinner bill, I don't recommend coming here.\u000a\u000aCan't wait for the next time!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VThis is my favorite Target in Vegas.  It's a Greatland Store, so it's HUGE.  Here's why I like it so much:\u000a\u000a- It's clean.  Keeping a store clean and organized are important to me.  This store is exceptional at both.\u000a\u000a- It's large.  I like big stores because it provides a selection of a wide variety of products.  One thing I hate doing is driving all over town to look for something.  I enjoy One Stop Shopping....especially when it comes to everyday household items.  If it's something special or unique, then I favor smaller stores....but that doesn't apply here, it's a Target.\u000a\u000a- Parking.  The parking lot has plenty of spaces for shoppers and the aisles are wide.\u000a\u000a- It's never crowded.  In the 10 yrs or so this store has been open, I've only seen it crowded during the after-Christmas sale where items can be as much as 75% OFF.....otherwise it's a pleasant experience.\u000a\u000aEven though it's a bit of a drive for me, I like stopping by this Target every once in a while.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 85%

VWhen I found out that they opened a Pin Kaow in Green Valley, I knew we had to stop on the way back to Phoenix for lunch.  Their other 2 locations are 2 of my favorite Thai restaurants on the planet.  Would Pin Kaow 3 be able to meet those standards...?  Why yes of course!\u000a\u000aWifey had the Pad See Ew, $9.95 with Thai spice Level 3\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pin-kaow-3-henderson?select=cbiOvOJPrwGHF4ze14KgDw#cbiOvOJPrwGHF4ze14KgDw\u000a\u000aI had the Crispy Tofu Pad Thai, $9.95 with Thai spice Level 7\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pin-kaow-3-henderson?select=j4IyhsLwTvA4UeQo0CeLAw#j4IyhsLwTvA4UeQo0CeLAw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pin-kaow-3-henderson?select=jgl3PClGu3OzDDzj7_ujwg#jgl3PClGu3OzDDzj7_ujwg\u000a\u000aBoth dishes were awesome!  The Pad Thai was a delish as I remember it....and the Level 7 spice was perfect.

Located next to the main lobby of the Bellagio, this place can get really crowded.....especially during the holiday season.\u000a\u000aThey change the design frequently, so it's a different experience every time we visit.  The best place to park if you want to check it out is the parking garage on the South end of the property.....you access the parking garage from Las Vegas Blvd.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

V101.1 The Beat is one of the Hip-Hop stations on my preset list.  I'm not a fan of all of the new Hip-Hop that's out there, so when I pop on to this station it's a 50/50 chance that I'll stay on it.  If there's a track that I like, I'll stay and listen until something comes on that I don't like.\u000a\u000aI don't listen to as much Hip-Hop as I used to when I was younger, but there's some good stuff out there now.  New stuff is mostly uncreative and boring, but every once in a while, you hear something good.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VTown Square is one of my favorite places in Vegas.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a- Outdoor Shopping....yes, there are many outdoor shopping malls in Vegas, but none like this.  The developer did a great job of replicating a modern, downtown shopping area where you can park in front of the store and walk down 'streets' and alleys.\u000a\u000a- Store Selection....Fry's Electronics, Rave Theater, Tommy Bahama, Banana Republic, Bebe, Armani Exchange, Hollister, Apple Store....there's something for everyone in the family.  My Better Half & Kid have their spots and I can spend the entire day at Fry's or in the Apple Store, ha!\u000a\u000a- Restaurants.....this is my favorite part of Town Square.....Grape Vegas, Johnny McGuire's, Yard House, Cadillac Ranch, Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza, Yogurtland, Dairy Queen are a few of the many restaurants we love to visit.  There's something for everyone....casual to upscale.\u000a\u000a- Parking....there's a ton of parking.....3 parking garages plus acres of space.\u000a\u000a- Atmosphere....When the weather is nice, I love to grab a Froyo @ Yogurtland and walk around window shopping, enjoying the scene.  There's a park in the middle of the Square with a water fountain and kids area for playing.  Sometimes they have events here, but I don't care for large crowds so I usually avoid them.\u000a\u000aOverall....a truly unique place in Vegas.  The only other places that are close to it in town are The District in Green Valley & Boca Park in Summerlin.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I'd go every day if it was closer to where I live.

VThis is one of the places I've missed the most since moving away from Vegas a few years ago.  I try to come here every time I come back to visit.....for many of the reasons I pointed out in my last review.  Since then they've added a couple of bars and restaurants that have added to the atmosphere of the place and has enhanced the vibe/energy of the place.\u000a\u000aThe only part of the shopping center that lacks energy is the North side of the place....for some reason, it just seems dead every time we're there.  The happening spot is right in front of the movie theater where there's a high concentration of restaurants/bars.  It's a cool spot for locals to hang out.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VWhat a disappointing location.  I didn't like my experience here at all.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a- No towels provided to you.  The locations I visit in Vegas always provide workout towels.  They do offer some logo'd ones for sale....#fail\u000a\u000a- Old, creaky equipment.  The elliptical I was on squeaked and 2 were out of order.\u000a\u000a- Old TV's.  They are the old school square type with bad pictures.....they should have been replaced a long time ago.\u000a\u000a- Dirty floors.  The gym floor was gross near the free weight area.  I like to do some floor exercises like pushups and stuff like that in between sets.....that's how I noticed how dirty it was.\u000a\u000a- Locker room was smelly.  I didn't like the locker room at all.....it smelled musty.\u000a\u000aOverall, I didn't get a good vibe in this gym.  Looks like I'll have to pay LA Fitness a visit.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 5%

VI have to admit, this place surprised me.  My expectations were very low when we walked by and noticed this restaurant.  It's out of the way, located between the Ft McDowell casino and the Radisson Hotel next door.  If we hadn't parked in the far back parking lot, we would've never stumbled across this place.\u000a\u000aAfter browsing the menu, we decided to give it a shot for dinner.  We ordered the following items:\u000a\u000aRisotto Duet (Habeero Orange, Poblano Vanilla), $7\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ahnala-mesquite-room-fort-mcdowell?select=KyaOVkefz0hPTrYcERTbCA#KyaOVkefz0hPTrYcERTbCA\u000a\u000aCactus Quesadilla, $7\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ahnala-mesquite-room-fort-mcdowell?select=yZN4-ypCO26fzrbrp1I9MQ#yZN4-ypCO26fzrbrp1I9MQ\u000a\u000aFilet (Crispy Shallots, Sherry Risotto, Sauted Broccolini, Tomato Jam, Red Wine), $38\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ahnala-mesquite-room-fort-mcdowell?select=AYeCBi8c3r4SCiZGXUxt1w#AYeCBi8c3r4SCiZGXUxt1w\u000a\u000aThe Risotto Duet was outstanding!  I've never had Risotto with Habanero Orange and Poblano Vanilla flavors before....very tasty and unique.  It's a large portion, even for 2 people.  We didn't realize that when we ordered and also ordered a Cactus Quesadilla for an appetizer.  That was very good too.  Unfortunately, we were stuffed by then and I already ordered the Filet....otherwise, I would've passed on an entree.\u000a\u000aThe Filet came out and I ended up splitting it with The Better Half.  We were both pretty full, so we only ate 1/2 of it.  It was very good though and I would order it again.\u000a\u000aThe service here was good, I wouldn't say excellent.  I'll come back.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VNice place to grab a bite for lunch.  It's located in the Fashion Square Mall.  That's the worst part about this place, the parking.  It's not an easy in/out.  So don't plan a working lunch here unless you want to deal with it.\u000a\u000aMy favorite dish here is the Hickory Burger, $10.75.  It's a pretty big Burger and it comes with Steak Fries.  It will fill you up nice.\u000a\u000aIt's never too busy at lunchtime and we enjoy sitting on the "patio" out in the mall....makes for great people watching.\u000a\u000aStaff is so/so....lot's of college age kids who's first job serving is here, so the service is inconsistent.\u000a\u000aOverall it's A-OK.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 65%

VMy Son and I stopped by to watch Anthony M try to finish the 3 lb Burger challenge......the Burger was actually 5+ lbs total weight!  (see pics)\u000a\u000aWe decided to order some food for ourselves as well.  I ordered the 1/2 lb Open Range Cheesburger ($11) w/Onion Rings ($2) & Loco Bueno Hot Wings ($10).  My Son ordered the 1 lb Big Daddy BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger ($16).  There were 11 people in our party, so I expected the service to be a little slow.\u000a\u000aOur food came out in a reasonable amount of time.....the Burger was OK, not great.  The Hot Wings tasted pretty good, but the sauce was not hot enough for me.  I asked for the hottest sauce they had and it was called the Texas Double Pepper.....it had a small kick to it, but it really didn't do much for me.  My Son enjoyed his Big Daddy BBQ Burger....it was huge at 1 lb, but it was nothing compared to the 3 lb Challenge!\u000a\u000aAnthony ordered his Burger at the same time we all ordered our food, but he didn't get his 3 lb Challenge Burger until we were all finished with our meals.  Keep that in mind if you want to do this challenge.....it will take 15-20 min longer for it to be ready vs other entrees.\u000a\u000aWhen they delivered the challenge Burger, they rang bells, whooped & hollered and made a big deal.  The staff announces it to the restaurant and they count down to start the 30 minute time limit.  Everyone in the restaurant watches as you try to eat this monster.  They advertise it as 3 lbs, which is within range for a normal person.....but it weighs it at over 5 lbs once you add it the 12 pieces of Bacon, Whole Onion, Whole Tomato, 6 slices of Cheese, Bun, and Lettuce!  Crazy!  I give Anthony props for giving it a shot.....he finished 1/2 of the Burger, which is respectful.  The manager told us 150 people have tried it, but only 5 have completed the challenge.  While we were dining there was another challenger at the bar.....we heard he only finished 1/2 the Burger too.  It's a $36 Burger in case you want to give it a try.....\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a pretty fun time hanging out with other Yelpers.  The food was just eh....OK.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 30%

VThis review is of their football stadium, which is modern and average size.  It's tucked away in the Southern part of the campus.  The walk to/from the parking lot is pretty far, and you might have to cut across some desert to create a shortcut.  I don't know why they just don't create a pathway through it.\u000a\u000aThe visitor's seating is larger than most visitors sections in other schools in the Valley.  The field is well kept.  Our son says it's one of the best kept fields he plays on.  The sound system and AV during the game is pretty good.  \u000a\u000aParking is tough....great parking spaces, but if it's a big game with a lot of people in attendance, plan to get stuck getting out of the lot.  It's like going to a Cardinals game....will take you a while to get out.  The nice facilities will bring us back.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VLocated in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, we enjoy bringing friends and relatives here.  Self parking is a mess here, so I use the valet service that's at the front of the restaurant.  It's 100x easier than trying to find parking yourself.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant is huge and offers indoor & outdoor seating as well as seating on the 2nd level.  We've always dined in the main dining room on the 1st floor.  Here are some of the menu items I've had:\u000a\u000aSweet Potato Fries, $8.99\u000aJalapeno Mac n Cheese, $10.99\u000aBlack Truffle Mac n Cheese, $13.99\u000aSpinach & Artichoke Dip, $10.99\u000aBBQ Burger, $12.99\u000aFilet, $29.99\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/saddle-ranch-chop-house-scottsdale?select=w5yMCDXjT_g93ur6zj0_QA#w5yMCDXjT_g93ur6zj0_QA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/saddle-ranch-chop-house-scottsdale?select=cJOIml3aeW0BW3G8EzFEbw#cJOIml3aeW0BW3G8EzFEbw\u000a\u000aI have to say that both their Jalapeno and Black Truffle Mac n Cheese dishes are some of the best Mac n Cheese dishes I've ever had.  They're a must have with every meal when we're here.\u000a\u000aThe Sweet Potato Fries and Spinach & Artichoke Dip are average.  The BBQ Burger is amazing...very juicy and sloppy with the BBQ Sauce dripping out of the sides of the Burger when I bite into it....yum!\u000a\u000aThe Filet is above average...I wouldn't say it's one of the best I've had though.  Although I order it slightly Medium Well, I think they leave it on too long because it comes out more on the well side than I prefer.  Most really good Steakhouses will get it right for me.\u000a\u000aThe atmosphere here is loud and fun.  There's a mechanical bull if that's your deal...on weekend nights, it's comical to watch the drunks jump on it.  On a few of our visits the server gave us complimentary Cotton Candy for dessert.  They're known for that....it's very good and always a pleasant surprise when we get it.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VGreat place for Happy Hour.  The office loves to come here on Fridays.  The joint reminds me of a beach bar in Mexico....cheap wood furniture, loud colors, cheesy beachy look....not really my style, but the majority rules in our office, so we end up here.\u000a\u000aIt's not too bad though because the drinks are cheap.  I bought a round of drinks for 16 people and it was less than $60 out the door, with tip!\u000a\u000aSo while the vibe isn't really my deal here, it's nice on the wallet.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VBuffet of Buffets Marathon - Stop #2 of 7 10:30 AM\u000a\u000aWe walked from Caesar's Palace to the Flamingo to make it to this stop on the BoB tour.  I was already beginning to feel stuffed from the Caesar's buffet, but charged ahead anyway.  The line here was a little longer than Caesar's, but we were seated promptly and had a nice view of the pool area where the Flamingos & Swans hung out.  I even saw a Black Swan....cool!\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw?select=auKWdF71D6A-MqzCJLsY-g\u000a\u000aThe 1st round we all went to the buffet near the entrance, which had standard breakfast offerings....we were a little disappointed that it was so small.  I grabbed a few Pastries, Eggs, Potatoes, and other stuff.  The food was so/so (2.5 Stars for this section)....then another Yelper Holly C said that there was a Crepe station in another room past the 1st buffet section....what?!  How did I miss that?!\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw?select=7yWOGpZ5VrHcpL2YWdcYnQ\u000a\u000aI immediately went to investigate.....yes, there was another huge section of Desserts, a Crepe station, Chocolate Fountain, Donuts, and other goodies.  I ordered a Blueberry Crepe from the nice woman working the station.  \u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw?select=UIQgmkOtmg22t5-_inbfww\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw?select=xbMwXlp78c3N82SeqQxvjw\u000aShe was very pleasant and curious about what we were doing with attempting to eat at all 7 Buffets in one day.  She did a good job on the Crepe, which tasted awesome.  The other Desserts in the area were very good (4 Stars for this section).....but it really started to fill me up.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw?select=J0YxypAGNZJLQZA9yc_rVA\u000a\u000aJust when we thought we saw it all, we discovered that there was a 3rd section of the Buffet!!!  There's a Chinese food section that opens at 11 am....I was done, but a few of the Yelpers I was with went to check it out and said it was very very good.\u000a\u000aOverall, this was a hidden gem surprise as we had low expectations for this buffet.  I wish I would have paced myself better so I could try the Chinese food....next time.  3 Stars weighted average for the Desserts and 1st section of the Buffet.  Incomplete on the Chinese food for me because I didn't have any.....other Yelpers loved it.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 72%

VLocated in our neighborhood, this Fresh & Easy is convenient, but disappointing.  Normally, I rate them 4 Stars.  This one only gets 3 Stars because they seem to run out of product all the time.  I love the IL Fornaio Italian Bread they sell.  However, many times this location will run out of it and there won't be any in stock.  This is at 5 or 6 pm, when I get off of work.  The Bread is what separates them from the rest in my eyes.  Look at all of the empty spots on this pic, it's very common to find the bread shelf like this:\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fresh-and-easy-neighborhood-market-scottsdale?select=tJ8iGjcbgMPuYAVeNfBlXg#tJ8iGjcbgMPuYAVeNfBlXg\u000a\u000aOther than the Bread issue, this place is OK.  \u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VI happened to be in the area and was hungry so I used the Android Yelp App to search for Sandwich joints in the area.  Found this one and decided to give it a shot.  I'm glad I did.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Wise Guys Sub (Capocolla, Mortadella, Hard Salami, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Roasted Red Peppers, Pepperoncini Peppers, Provolone, and Basil Mayo) on Ciabatta Bread $6.99, a bag of Jalapeno Chips $.80, and a Bottle of Water $1.99.\u000a\u000aThe food came out within a few minutes.  The size of the Sandwich was just right....not too big and not too small.  I eagerly took a bite and was impressed with the flavor that the Roasted Red Peppers brought to the Sandwich.  I've had a lot of Italian Sandwiches and have never had one with Roasted Red Peppers.....additionally, the Basil Mayo added another element to the Sub which made it very good.  The proportion of Meat and toppings was very good.\u000a\u000aThe only complaint is that with all of that wet stuff in the Sandwich, the ingredients were sliding off the Bread and it took some work to keep it all together.  I didn't dock them any stars for that....it's more of a preference thing.\u000a\u000aOf course the Sandwich came with a Spicy Pickle.....which I didn't think was too Spicy at all.....nice flavor though.  Would have enjoyed a really Spicy Pickle.....was hoping for one.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I live on the other side of town and rarely come to Egypt....but next time I'm near the area, I'll be back.

VA bookstore....that's someplace I don't visit as much as I used to.  I do most of my bookstore shopping online.  This particular trip was because our Son needed a book for a reading assignment and of course instead of planning ahead and ordering a used book online, he waited until the last minute so we had to go find a new one....$$$.\u000a\u000aGood thing I went though, because I walked away with some Star Wars stuff for myself...ha!\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barnes-and-noble-tempe?select=60avMvahFmow9xyhobOwVA#60avMvahFmow9xyhobOwVA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barnes-and-noble-tempe?select=0JhFNOvwvJPM5l1NhC_Kdg#0JhFNOvwvJPM5l1NhC_Kdg\u000a\u000aIt was a Saturday morning and the store had decent business with people in the Coffee Shop area as well as the books area.

VWhen I moved here 2 yrs ago, everyone spoke about the legendary 16th hole at the Phoenix Open.  I watched from one of the corporate skyboxes and I have to admit, it was pretty entertaining.  However, after 4 days of it, I was over it.  It reminds me of my college party days.....drinking, shouting, and a bunch of nonsense.  Somewhere during the day, there's some golf played I guess.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/16th-hole-at-fbr-open-scottsdale?select=XS63o6ko-7FHlW5S7-3RgQ#XS63o6ko-7FHlW5S7-3RgQ\u000a\u000aThe betting on the the Caddie Races is hysterical.  I love how the poor PGA guys try to keep it quiet for the golfers hitting the ball....yeah right, no chance.  Imagine trying to hit a golf ball at a frat party with 5,000 drunk guys screaming at you....it's got to be tough for the golfers.  Some take it in stride, others seem annoyed at the spectacle of things.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/16th-hole-at-fbr-open-scottsdale?select=3O8ZsoJD2_qbiqjP-J0pvA#3O8ZsoJD2_qbiqjP-J0pvA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/16th-hole-at-fbr-open-scottsdale?select=FOS595df5QbkBAW5GwfD5w#FOS595df5QbkBAW5GwfD5w\u000a\u000aI try to explain it to friends, but there's nothing like experiencing it for yourself.  This year is my 2nd year, same ol' nonsense.....you just have to be there.\u000a\u000aWatching Mickelson dominate this year on this hole was pretty cool.  That and all of the ASU chants were cracking me up.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VI love Pizza.  It's one of my weaknesses.  This place serves up good Pizza and other items as well.  On Mondays they have 1/2 off bottles of Wine.  Bottles are as cheap as $15, how can you beat that?!\u000a\u000aOver several trips, we've tried the following menu items:\u000a\u000aFilet Mignon Sliders, $12.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crust-pizza-and-wine-cafe-scottsdale?select=qemac_ZxOffI83Ws9agJLw#qemac_ZxOffI83Ws9agJLw\u000a\u000aBig Boy Sandwich (Ham, Salami, Prosciutto, Sopressatta, Provolone & Roasted Peppers drizzled with Extra Virgin Olive Oil & Balsamic Vinegar), $8.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crust-pizza-and-wine-cafe-scottsdale?select=MKWlE4L9T77hBmnXF6oObA#MKWlE4L9T77hBmnXF6oObA\u000a\u000aSpinach & Artichoke Dip, $10\u000a\u000aFried Calmari, $11\u000a\u000a20" Uncle Louie Pizza (Sausage, Pepperoni, Marinated Tomatoes, Fresh Mozz, Basil), $22.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crust-pizza-and-wine-cafe-scottsdale?select=kFnaro35eDVgQarSvw-x9Q#kFnaro35eDVgQarSvw-x9Q\u000a\u000aRollatini "Calzone" (Sausage, Peppers, Onions, Ham, Salami, Sopressata & Mozzarella), $8.50\u000a\u000aMy favorite is the Uncle Louie.  The 20" is a huge Pizza that can easily feed 3 to 4 people.  I love how they use Fresh Mozz instead of the regular Cheese you find at most Pizza joints.  Their Sauce is also very good here.\u000a\u000aFor lunch, the Rollatini or "Calzone", Big Boy Sandwich, and Filet Sliders hit the spot....you can't go wrong with any of the 3.\u000a\u000aOverall, this is one of our fav dining spots in the area.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VMet several old colleagues here for lunch today.  It was the first time I've been to this location, so I was kind of excited to give it a try.  The location is conveniently located off the 215 & Flamingo Rd.....so it was easy access for me and them.\u000a\u000aThe traditional Lindo's Chips & Salsa is served here, complimentary.  It has the same fresh, awesome taste as the other locations.  Good start.\u000a\u000aAfter browsing the menu for a little while, I settled on the Lunch Special #3 "Tres".....Beef Chimichanga.  I was going to order a Dos XX or a Pacifico, but since my friends were on lunch from work, I didn't want to throw it in their face that I can drink at lunch and they can't....so I abstained and had an Iced Tea.\u000a\u000aThe food came out pretty fast.  The Chimichanga comes with Rice, Beans, and Sour Cream & Guacamole on the side.  It was cooked just right.....the fried Tortilla was crispy, flaky, and not greasy.  The Beef was shredded and full of flavor.  I like to get their signature Salsa and pour it on top of the Chimichanga....because the Salsa packs a lot of heat and has that Smoky Chipotle flavor to it.  I mixed the Beans & Rice together and devoured the plate.\u000a\u000aThe service was excellent and everyone had a good time.  We spent an hour after lunch talking and catching up on stuff.....even though we settled our bill, the server ensured our glasses were full and that everyone was ok.  It's the signature service I've come to know and love about Lindo and his restaurants....glad to see it was the same here.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Of course!

VMy "go to" place to grab a bite to eat when I'm in the C-Gates area of McCarran Int'l Airport.  I like to grab a Burrito & a Brewskie while I wait for my plane to depart.  Since I'm one of those guys who likes to get to the airport super early so I don't miss my flight, I have plenty of time to kill.  The FREE WiFi is awesome because I can surf the web while I enjoy my eats from this place.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VWith the exception of Christmas, this Post Office is a great location to get your mail out because there are rarely any long lines like the ones you find at the other locations in Vegas.\u000a\u000aIt's also very convenient for me as I workout next door at the 24 Hour Fitness.  The people here are very friendly and it's a pretty relaxed environment.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet.

VI like the products at Costco.....and if I rated the products only, I would rate it 5 Stars....but it only gets 2 Stars from me because:\u000a\u000a- This store is always crazy busy.\u000a\u000a- Parking is a nightmare, the flow of traffic is nuts and doesn't make sense.  Too many in/out points.\u000a\u000a- The layout of the store doesn't make any sense to me at all.  The Kleenex & paper towels are buried all the way in the back right side of the store.  The liquor is split up into multiple areas encompassing 2 aisles and an open area for the wine.  Huh?\u000a\u000a- The lines for the registers butt up against products and aisles and is difficult to get in/out of the center registers.\u000a\u000a- The exit is a Cluster-F.....all registers roll into a single lane to get out....when there are a lot of people getting food near the exit it gets really hairy.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Only when I'm forced to....which is when I need items I can't find at Sam's Club.

VAfter reading all of the great reviews of this place, I was really really hoping for a great sandwich experience.  I don't live anywhere near this place but happened to be in the neighborhood yesterday, so I decided to make a stop here.\u000a\u000aI ordered a Regular Sized (9") Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich with Provolone & Peppers.\u000a\u000aThe woman working there was very nice and friendly.  The other customers in the joint appeared to be regulars because she knew them by name and already knew what a few of them wanted......very impressive.  You don't find service like that too often in Vegas.\u000a\u000aMy sandwich was very fresh & hot and looked awesome.  However, in the taste department it fell flat for me.  I thought the Beef was a little bland.....it didn't have that distinctive taste that I expect from a Steak Sandwich.  I also thought it could have used more Cheese as I could barely taste the Provolone.  The Peppers were good.....although, I didn't know you had the option to order Sweet or Hot Peppers until I overheard other people asking for them.....wish I would have known, I would have ordered Hot......to be fair, it's printed on the menu on the wall.....but I overlooked it as I was trying to read everything and figure out what to order before someone else came in and cut in front of me.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a pleasant experience and even though the Steak Sandwich didn't do it for me, I will give this place another try the next time I'm in the area so I can try the Pastrami & Swiss Burger and their Italian Sandwich.  Until then, it gets 3 Stars in my book.

VFor some reason I'm on a Fatburger kick lately.  I was in the area, so I stopped by and ordered a Large Fatburger with Cheese and Skinny Fries. \u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5jTmjxb1X34EfcY1gos4tw?select=GHXXu6KUhAB1WgvXVovFBg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5jTmjxb1X34EfcY1gos4tw?select=nuXk9K_k26TXuwTqscisEA\u000aI like this location because the restaurant is always clean and there are plenty of seats and tables.\u000a\u000aThe food took a while to come out.....it's Fatburger after all.  The Fatburger was very good, as usual, and the Fries were cooked just right.  I couldn't finish the order of Fries, next time I'll pass.  Solid 4 Stars ()\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VOk, I've seriously died and went to Artery Clogging Heaven!  This place is Awesome!\u000a\u000aAmong other things, I really enjoy Burgers & Hot Dogs....and this place has plenty of it!  There were so many things on the menu, I didn't know where to start.....\u000a\u000aSo, I went with a Pastrami Cheeseburger (Pastrami, Grilled Onions, Provolone, & Mustard on a Burger)....and a Regular Hot Dog.\u000a\u000aSince I was dining solo, I sat at the counter behind the Grill.  I waited patiently and watched the short order cook prepare the artery choking goodness for all the patrons and myself.....that was fun.\u000a\u000aAfter about 10 minutes my order was up.  I went after the Pastrami Cheeseburger first.....wow, it was tasty.  I liked the proportion of Pastrami to Cheeseburger.....some places put too much Pastrami and it overwhelms the burger....not here.  I also liked how well the Grilled Onions tasted.....they were chopped in med sized pieces which I prefer to the larger sized ones you find in some places.  It was so good, I didn't add anything to it....I ate it as it was served.\u000a\u000aNext, I added some Mustard to the Regular Dog and bit into it.  I felt a familiar ~Snap~ as I took that first bite.....awesome!  You don't find too many snapper dogs around town, so I was pleased that I did.  Every bite was full of Hot Dog goodness.\u000a\u000aThere are so many varieties of Dogs & Burgers here, not to mention side dishes that I want to try.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I guarantee you I'll be back at least 10 times to try other stuff on the menu.

VWhen the Better Half and I are in the Palazzo, Double Helix is a must stop for us.  We love how the bar is in the middle of the shopping mall in the Palazzo.....it's perfect for people watching, which is one of our favorite pastimes.  We'll saddle up to the bar or relax in the center of the lounge area.  Either way, it's a nice break from the action.\u000a\u000aThe prices for Wine in the Wine shop is pretty reasonable too and I heard they deliver to your hotel room.....much cheaper than room service and better quality Wine!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 88%

VLocated in the very popular Tempe Marketplace, this is a fun spot to get together after work.  The office has celebrated a couple of birthdays and a few going away parties here.  It's always in the top 3 choices for the young-ins in the office when they get to pick a place for their special day.  There's plenty of space here to accommodate large or small groups.  Our get togethers are normally in the 20-30 people range and we've never had any issues with service.\u000a\u000aThe appetizers are good here.  Potato Skins and Nachos are the two that I've sampled.  I've only had appetizers and drinks here, so I can't speak about the entrees.\u000a\u000aI hear it's awesome on the weekends, but that's for a much younger crowd and I outgrew that scene many moons ago.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VSince the weather has been so awesome lately, we decided to give this trail a try.  After browsing the map of the various trails, we decided to do the "Lollipop Loop", which is a little over 5 miles and includes this route:\u000a\u000aLost Dog Wash Trail to \u000aTaliesin Overlook (backtrack) to\u000aOld Jeep Trail to\u000aRingtail Trail to \u000aLost Dog Wash Trail\u000a\u000aThe trail is very easy and good for beginners.  There was a lot of trail bike and jogger action on the trail.  One group of hikers had strollers with 2 babies....seriously?!  That was a complete fail...I don't know what they were thinking.\u000a\u000aUntil you get to higher ground with decent views....Taliesin Overlook and a couple of spots on the Old Jeep Trail and Ringtail Trail....there's not much to look at.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lost-dog-wash-trail-scottsdale?select=2fDEe35-hrvJmn5Zsp-YnQ#2fDEe35-hrvJmn5Zsp-YnQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lost-dog-wash-trail-scottsdale?select=D9Tp167HbQYd9AYLlscDYA#D9Tp167HbQYd9AYLlscDYA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lost-dog-wash-trail-scottsdale?select=piv7Jl4vqvzzqpZSEX-gdw#piv7Jl4vqvzzqpZSEX-gdw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lost-dog-wash-trail-scottsdale?select=fwIsLFwlv9NREVlK0G3uHQ#fwIsLFwlv9NREVlK0G3uHQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lost-dog-wash-trail-scottsdale?select=2SXvipCe9Uc537UwYfX9Mw#2SXvipCe9Uc537UwYfX9Mw\u000a\u000aOther than those views, there's not much to look at besides the Sonoran Desert.....Cholla, Saguaro, weeds, brush, random green stuff.  I read Lisa E's review on this trail and was hoping to see a lot of wildlife, but besides an occasional bird or two squawking, we didn't see or hear anything....no Javelina, Coyotes, Hawks, Bobcats, or Mountain Lions.....we struck out.\u000a\u000aThere are restrooms at the trail head and the parking lot is nice and adequate.  I'm not sure I'll hike this trail again....I might go up to 128th St next time and do the Sunrise Trail, which is on the backside of the Lollipop Loop.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VI love Spring Training and this is one of my favorite ballparks.  It reminds me of the Kentucky Derby.  The park is relatively small and there's not a bad seat in the house.

VThanks to Groupon, we found this joint.  We dropped in here twice to give it a shot. After browsing the menu, I got super excited...they have Tri-Tip on the menu!!  Growing up in So Cal, BBQ Tri-Tip can be found everywhere in Cali...but is difficult to find anywhere else....so this got me going.  The menu was full of items we wanted to try, so we decided to pig out and order:\u000a\u000aTri-Tip Sandwich, $7\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ribshack-bbq-scottsdale?select=Jgn7JZ3ziA6OBsPoItZ2iQ#Jgn7JZ3ziA6OBsPoItZ2iQ\u000a\u000aPulled Pork Sandwich, $5.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ribshack-bbq-scottsdale?select=cylqtkEZkpXEsZbc3-HMVA#cylqtkEZkpXEsZbc3-HMVA\u000a\u000a1/2 Rack of Ribs, $12.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ribshack-bbq-scottsdale?select=KF-twY_w1ZCAQ99uyYs5qw#KF-twY_w1ZCAQ99uyYs5qw\u000a\u000aHot Links Sandwich, $4.00\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ribshack-bbq-scottsdale?select=67EY5EuVp1j_lr97QhsL0w#67EY5EuVp1j_lr97QhsL0w\u000a\u000aBBQ Beef Sandwich, $5.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ribshack-bbq-scottsdale?select=8pDmW_0c8qGWVi_7oLA2oQ#8pDmW_0c8qGWVi_7oLA2oQ\u000a\u000aMac n Cheese, $1.65\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ribshack-bbq-scottsdale?select=3eMvoA5p-VWPXwtxS1Zeog#3eMvoA5p-VWPXwtxS1Zeog\u000a\u000aSlaw, $1.65\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ribshack-bbq-scottsdale?select=Ff16sZ5g-n_i6wBAC9x00A#Ff16sZ5g-n_i6wBAC9x00A\u000a\u000aRed Beans & Rice, $1.65\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ribshack-bbq-scottsdale?select=YIsvjBrObW4DeKkHQ-Fq9A#YIsvjBrObW4DeKkHQ-Fq9A\u000a\u000aBBQ Baked Beans, $1.65\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ribshack-bbq-scottsdale?select=J3KZogUplw7uUYNz_cP3Fw#J3KZogUplw7uUYNz_cP3Fw\u000a\u000aWe sat at a table and waited for our food.  At the table, you have 3 BBQ Sauces available.....Mild, Spicy, and Carolina Vinegar.  My favorite of the 3 was the Carolina Vinegar....tasted much better and spicier than the other 2.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ribshack-bbq-scottsdale?select=cRU649rlaIr_VsD-Vl_faw#cRU649rlaIr_VsD-Vl_faw\u000a\u000aThe first thing I tried was the Tri-Tip....I dressed it with Hot Sauce and took a bite....it was underwhelming, just ok.  With every bite, I was hoping that more flavor would jump out at me....but alas, I was disappointed.  The Meat was also a bit dry....bummer.\u000a\u000aNext I tried some of The Better Half's sandwich that she ordered....the Pulled Pork Sandwich.  I took a bite and was also underwhelmed.  \u000a\u000aThe BBQ Beef Sandwich had a little more flavor but was average at best.\u000a\u000aThe Hot Links tasted ok, they were spicy....however, it was served on a regular Hot Dog Bun....not much to it.\u000a\u000aOk, how about the sides?  I tried a bite from each of them....the Mac 'n Cheese tasted *meh*....like the boxed Velveeta Cheese from the store.  The Red Beans & Rice was not like what I was hoping for (New Orleans Style)....this one was very dry and had a ton of Tomatoes in it....the RBR I've had in New Orleans is much more wet and I don't recall this much Tomato in it.  The best side was the Slaw & Baked Beans....those were actually very good and our favorite out of the 4 sides.  We only ate 2 bites out of the RBR and 1/2 of the Mac 'n Cheese.\u000a\u000aLast to try was the Ribs...it had to be good, right?  Wrong....that was dry too....damn!  Even dousing the Ribs with Sauce didn't help too much....they fell off the bone, like they're supposed to, but the meat was dry as jerky.  Maybe that's their style of BBQ?  I don't know, but it wasn't good for us.\u000a\u000aI really really wanted to like this place....it had so much potential when I looked at the menu....but I left disappointed.  Oh well, the search for good BBQ continues.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 10%

VI just had lunch with a colleague today.  The food was very good.  I've been here 3 times for dinner and once for lunch.  Much better at lunch than at dinner...don't know why.\u000a\u000aFood - I had the Spicy Chicken Breast Sandwich, which is:\u000agrilled with blackening spices, cheddar and jack, cabbage and cajun aoli on cheese flat bread....  \u000a\u000aI also had 2 glasses of Shock Top, which is rapidly becoming my favorite beer.....I can thank Tampa, FL for that.\u000a\u000aThe service was good and the atmosphere was even better.  The weather was perfect, so we ate outside on the patio.\u000a\u000aI gave it 4 stars.  If the food was better, it would have received 5 stars.  If they didn't have such a huge selection of beer, it would have received 3 stars.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Yes.

VUntil last night's visit to the Yardhouse I was a big fan....now, I'm not so sure, here's why.\u000a\u000aA good friend and his fiance were visiting from California and wanted to get together for dinner & drinks.  Since Town Square is located on the Strip, it was a convenient place for us to meet.  Over the past few weeks I've been drinking a lot of IPA's and Chimay and was telling him that the Yardhouse would be a great place for him to give them a try.  Since they don't have a Yardhouse where he lives in California, we were all very excited.\u000a\u000aThe Better Half and I met them at the Yardhouse.  It was pretty packed for a Sunday evening but we were able to find 4 spots at the bar in the corner so we could face each other and get seated immediately.  After browsing the beer menu, we decided on a Stone IPA.....the bartender said they no longer had it.  Ok, how about the Long Hammer IPA?  Nope...no longer carry it.  He proceeded to tell me they only had 1 or 2 of the IPA's on the menu because they are in the process of switching out the menu......what?  WTF is that?  I understand changing out the menu, but not being able to offer what you have listed until you make the change.....that's BS!  Especially for a place that claims to have 100's of beers on tap!  Ok.....well, if that's the case we asked for a Chimay Triple....guess what?  They didn't have any!\u000a\u000aAt this point I was a little embarrassed because I hyped up this place as a solid "go to" place to enjoy new brews and good food.  We settled for a Ranger IPA and called it a day.\u000a\u000aFor food we ordered Hot Wings, 4 Cheese Pizza, Jambalaya, and Sliders.  The Pizza was very soggy, even though I ordered it well done....that's the second time we've had Pizza and it come out soggy....we won't order it again.  The rest of the food was good, but not great.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a disappointing night at the Yardhouse.  There are tons of places in Vegas that serve good bar food, but came here specifically for beers that were not available....and that's suppose to set them apart from the rest.  I hope this was an anomaly and not the beginning of a trend.

VStopped by this location to look for some Golf gear and left disappointed.  There isn't a Golf section here!  At the location in Vegas where I shop frequently, there's a large Golf section with plenty of options....not here.  Too bad.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 2%

VWhenever we are in Vegas and stay at the Palazzo, The Better Half insists on stopping by this joint so she can get her Sushi on.  On this particular visit, I joined her for lunch and we grubbed.\u000a\u000aShe ordered 4 orders of Unagi (Eel), $4 ea. I ordered some Edamame, $6 and the Seared Wagyu Beef, $18.\u000a\u000aThe Beef was awesome and while it's a small plate, it's very rich and fulfilling.  TBH enjoyed her Unagi....it's her fav.\u000a\u000aWe ate lunch at around 3 pm, which is a great time to do that because it's between the busy lunch and dinner hours, so there's not too many people around.  When it gets busy, it can get crowded.\u000a\u000aWe'll definitely be back.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VWhat a great place to shop, eat, and hang out.  I came here on a Saturday morning to check it out and discovered that this place is a hub of activity.  People hanging out at the tables on the sidewalk with their dogs, enjoying a cup of Coffee & eats from the store.  That's what drew me in....\u000a\u000aMy first impression of the place was that it's a smaller version of Whole Foods.  Lots of choices for Organic Food and high quality products.....perfect!  But what really caught my eye was the selection of Craft Beer!  Usually a joint like this would only have a few options...not here.  So....I grabbed a 6 Pack of Hop Ottin' IPA.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Hv3iuAYsoF2FjH0ND9rIKg?select=TfR9h9_KIteR-fJhvDqYpg\u000aThere are plenty of others to choose from too, which will definitely bring me back.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Hv3iuAYsoF2FjH0ND9rIKg?select=EldltbF7bTHWihkA3FjsCw\u000a\u000aI wasn't hungry when I was in the store (thank God), but I want to come back and enjoy a meal outside too.

VUntil I moved to Scottsdale, I had no idea what AJ's was all about.  Since then, this has become my 'go to' spot for buying Craft Beer and Wine in a pinch.  We only live a few blocks away and whenever we go to a friend's house for dinner or a party, we stop by here to grab beverages.\u000a\u000aThey have an excellent selection of Wine and Beer....for a grocery store, they're on the higher end of the scale.  I like it much better than Whole Foods too....I don't know why, but I just feel more comfortable in here.\u000a\u000aOne thing you can count on at this store location....there's always people hanging out on the patio sipping Coffee or Tea with their dogs....especially on weekend mornings.  It has a nice neighborhood feel to it.  That's why we keep coming back.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VI love going to a Library.  It's a nice break from the day to day rat race.  Was here today to study and work on one of my final projects due in a couple of weeks.\u000a\u000aThis Library is one of my favorite ones in Vegas.  Why?  Here's the breakdown:\u000a\u000aPROS\u000a- It's clean and well kept.\u000a\u000a- If they don't have the book you're looking for, they will order it from another library in Vegas so you can pick it up later.\u000a\u000a- There are plenty of quiet areas where you can sit, read, study, or relax.\u000a\u000a- They enforce the "no cell phone" rule.....some libraries in town don't.\u000a\u000a- They have an Arts area where they feature local artists' work.\u000a\u000aCONS\u000a- The lines to check out books can be slow at times.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a great place to be.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Of course!

VAfter reading many reviews on Yelp and driving past this joint 100's of times, I finally decided to stop by today for lunch to check it out myself.  I decided to give myself a treat after a great workout at the gym.....have to give back some of the calories, right?\u000a\u000aI had no idea how it worked and the menu in the restaurant is posted at the front door facing your back when you enter...so you see it when you exit.....what the hell?  Seems very illogical to me, but whatever.  Because I didn't see the menu when I walked in, I had no idea what to do....so I asked the kid at the register, how does this work?  He kind of looked at me with a puzzled expression and said "You place an order and I take it"......he was kidding around and explained that there are specialty Burgers that I can choose from or I can "Create" my own.  You choose 1/4, 1/3, or 1/2 lb patties, the bread, and the toppings.\u000a\u000aAfter browsing the specialty Burgers for a minute, I decided I wanted to order two of them.  I ordered a 1/4 lb Dali Burger  with White Bread & (Avocado, Peppers, Onions, Monterey Jack Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, & Southwestern Ranch) and a 1/4 lb Impressionist Burger with Onion Bread & (Cajun Seasoning, Jalapenos, Lettuce, Tomato, Pepper Jack, & Atomic Mayo w/side of BBQ Sauce) and a bottle of Water.  He suggested that I get a side of BBQ Sauce with the Impressionist Burger....I took him up on his recommendation.  Total damage ($11.73), for the Burgers & bottled Water.  The price you see on the menu is the combo price.  He issued me a number and my change and told me they would bring out the Burgers when it was ready.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant has plenty of seating and nice comfortable booths....not what I expected.  They also sell Frozen Custard here....since I'm unfamiliar with what that is, I passed on trying it this visit.\u000a\u000aAfter a few minutes my order was delivered by the manager.  He apologized because they ran out of Guacamole and substituted it with whole Avocado on the Dali Burger....I told him that was fine.  I started to take pics of the food and when he saw me, he asked if I wanted a picture with the Burger....I laughed and said yes.  What a nice guy.\u000a\u000aI jumped into the Impressionist Burger first.....I couldn't wait to try it since it was loaded with Spicy Toppings.....I decided to take the first bite without the BBQ Sauce.  Wow....it was Spicy!  It had a very nice kick to it....not too blazing hot, but very enjoyable.  I am impressed because most joints make their mild....not this one!  Then I tried it with the BBQ Sauce per the cashier kid's advice.....yum!  The BBQ Sauce combined with the spicy flavor of the Atomic Mayo, Jalapenos, and Pepper Jack made this burger taste really good.  I wish I would have ordered a 1/3 lb patty though as the 1/4 lb seemed to be too small with all of the toppings.  The Beef was very flavorful, but I could have used more of it...next time I'll get the 1/3 or 1/2 lb patty....my bad.\u000a\u000aAfter devouring the Impressionist, I went for the Dali Burger.  I loaded the Avocados into the Burger and again took a bite before I tried it with the Southwest Ranch Sauce.....it was pretty good, but needed the Ranch.  I poured some of the Ranch with each subsequent bite.....wow, another excellent Burger!  The Onion Bun added to it.....another great recommendation from the cashier kid....he must eat a ton of their Burgers to figure out great combinations of stuff.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a good experience....fresh, flavorful ingredients and the ability to customize your Burger are the highlights of this place.  The one knock would be the Bread....it was very "doughy" and just didn't do it for me.....tasted like and had the consistency of Wonder Bread.  Despite that flaw, I still gave it 4 Stars.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I want to try some of the other specialty burgers as well as up the patty size....so, yeah I will be returning soon!

VHad dinner here with a colleague recently.  After browsing the menu, decided to go for the Baked Ziti (Bolognese, Spinach, Ricotta, Mozzarella Cheese, $16) and a glass of 2007 Frog's Leap Zinfandel, $12.50.  The weather was awesome, so we dined outside on the patio.\u000a\u000aOur server was awesome and made sure our glasses of Wine were never empty.  The food came out pretty fast.  I took one bite of my Ziti and instantly became a fan!  The Bolognese Sauce had the right combination of Spinach & Ricotta to make a heavenly dish....the proportions of ingredients was just right so that any one flavor didn't overpower the meal.  It went great with the glass of Zin.....which had a nice Chocolate-Berry flavor with a slight Peppery bite to it....yum!\u000a\u000aOverall, it was really good dinner.  Can't wait to come back and take The Better Half.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

VBecause it's on the Strip, we don't get down to The Shoppes to often....however, when we make the trip, we're always happy that we did.  There is a nice selection of upscale shops.....Fendi, Billionaire, Burberry, Coach...and many more.  Those are a few of the shoppes The Better Half (TBH) and I like to browse.\u000a\u000aWhile we're here, we always make sure to stop by the Double Helix Wine Bar to enjoy a glass of Wine while we're shopping.\u000a\u000aLocated on the 2nd floor of the Palazzo, it's away from the action of the Casino.  There's a good selection of restaurants on the 2nd floor as well.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You can count on it.

VI enjoy coming here for the FREE WiFi, food, & beer.  This particular location is the closest BWW to my house, so I frequent it the most.\u000a\u000aToday I went for the Sampler.....Nachos, Cheese Sticks, Boneless Wings, and Onion Rings....yeah baby!  I thought the sampler was excellent, except the Nachos which were just OK in my book.  I'm not a huge fan of their Cheese/Chili combo on the Nachos.\u000a\u000aWashed it down with an Apricot Wheat beer....went for the Ranger IPA next and then the other IPA they have on tap to end the day.\u000a\u000aThe place isn't too busy in the middle of the day, so it was nice to have most of the bar area to myself.  The server was awesome and very helpful.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Of course...I will be here often.

VSince I won't be able to make the UYE Cheeburger Cheeburger Challenge in July, I went there today for lunch to make a run at the "Pounder" Burger (20 oz).\u000a\u000aI ordered a Pounder with Jalapenos, Pepper Jack Cheese, & Mayo.  I passed on Fries or Onion Rings because I wanted to make sure I had enough room to finish this monster burger.\u000a\u000aThe waitress was very friendly and the service was good.  It didn't take long for my burger to come out.\u000a\u000aI immediately attacked it and pulled an Adam Richman.....I ate as fast as I could to avoid my stomach getting full.  I was surprised in that I never had to stop....I annihilated the burger in less than 10 min.  Besides the occasional pause to add mustard, I didn't have to catch my breath.  It was easier than I expected.\u000a\u000aWith the challenge completed, the waitress took a picture of me for the wall....there was another customer who completed the challenge in the restaurant, so he got his picture taken as well.\u000a\u000aThe burger itself tasted ok....it wasn't anything great.  Maybe I ate it too fast and didn't get a chance to savor the flavor....I don't know.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Yes, to give a regular burger, fries, onion rings, and shake a try.

VI was able to make the UYE burger challenge after all, but didn't participate in the 1 lb competition.  I was at a BBQ earlier in the day and since I completed the challenge last month, I didn't feel compelled to do it again.\u000a\u000aSo, I decided I would give the Milkshake & Onion Rings a try.  I ordered an Oreo Cheesecake & Peanut Butter Milkshake and a Small order of Onion Rings.  The Milkshake was good, but it was too runny.  I like thick Shakes.  The Onion Rings were very thin and very, very greasy....didn't have much flavor either.....very bland.  Despite ordering the Creamy Jalapeno Sauce to go along with the Onion Rings, it didn't help it much.\u000a\u000aOverall, I had a good time with fellow Yelpers at the UYE, but the food was eh.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Probably not....there are too many burger joints in town and this one is kind of far from my house.

VThis is a superb place to have lunch or brunch.  It's not cheap, so don't come in here with that kind of attitude.  It's a place to be seen in Vegas.  I've been here several times over the past few years and I always see a celebrity while dining.  Gawking is not cool, so if you're easily impressed with that kind of stuff, save the jaw dropping and drooling for the casino floor and nightclub.....this is not for rookies.\u000a\u000aNow, about the food.....it's very, very good.  Some of the dishes I've had over the last few visits:\u000a\u000aFarm Fresh Omelet (Mushrooms, Bell Peppers, Onions, Cheese, Ham, Spinach, $13)\u000aBlack Angus Burger ($15)\u000aGrilled Cheese Sandwich w/Bacon ($14)\u000aMargherita Pizza ($14)\u000a\u000aThe Grilled Cheese is excellent!  My favorite Grilled Cheese Sandwich in Vegas.  The Burger is solid.  When I feel like having breakfast at lunch, I'll go for the Omelet.....it never disappoints.\u000a\u000aThe atmosphere is trendy and the large glass windows facing the pool allow a ton of natural lighting to come in and set a unique mood that you can't find in Vegas very often.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's one of my favorite places in Vegas.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VThings I like:\u000a+ D-backs games.\u000a+ Suns games.\u000a+ Easy in/out and layout for downtown area.\u000a+ Many festivals and cultural events.\u000a\u000aThings I don't like:\u000a- Lack of parking downtown.\u000a- Lack of nightlife downtown.  Yes, there are restaurants and bars....but there's no "life" down there...it's very boring.\u000a- Heavy handed DUI enforcement.  Luckily, I haven't had a DUI, but I know many people who have and in other states they wouldn't have received it.  One drink an you're done here in PHX, no bueno.\u000a- No "Chinatown area".....in a city as large as Phoenix? Finding very good, authentic Asian food is extremely difficult in this city.  The choices are far and few between.\u000a- They say the city is "on a grid"....however, this "grid" is super confusing.  As someone who moved here 2 yrs ago, there are still things I don't understand about the streets....why some streets go all the way across the "grid" and others change names several times.  Also, there's a 5th street in Phoenix, Mesa, Scottsdale and I don't know how many other cities nearby.....how does that make any sense?\u000a\u000aOverall, it's not too bad of a place.  I've seen much worse.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VI've seen Terry Fator's show a handful of times.  It's a very entertaining show that is family friendly.  This is no ordinary ventriloquist show.  He is seriously talented.   He nails each voice and leaves you wondering how he did it.  There's a good amount of humor in the show too.\u000a\u000aEveryone I've taken to see this show has been amazed and wanted to see it again.  I don't want to give away too much, but if you're looking for a nice show to take people of all ages, this is one to consider.\u000a\u000aWill I see it again?  Sure!

VThere are two Burger King's that I generally visit when I'm at the Airport in Vegas.....one in the C Gates area and the other is in the A/B Gate area.  This review is for both of them......\u000a\u000aThey're always busy, so it's not always guaranteed that you can "grab n go" with the food.  The seating area in the C Gate area can also get very busy.....the seating at the other location is usually open because the customers at the A/B Gate location usually get their food and go to their gate since it's at a fork between the 2 gate areas and there's still a 2-3 minute walk to the actual gate.  Keep that in mind if you're planning to grab a bite before your flight.\u000a\u000aThe food is.....well, it's fast food and doesn't taste any different than the locations outside of the airport, just realize the cost is 50% higher.  The service level is decent, not great.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a solid place to grab a quick bite and deserves the 3 Star rating in my book.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VSince the The Better Half had to work today, she made me come here to look for Christmas decorations that were on Sale for 75% off.  It's been a while since I've been to this Target location and wasn't looking forward to dealing with the madness of these types of sales.....however, since I love my Wife I went along with it.  She gave me a list of things to buy.\u000a\u000aThe store was clean and well kept.  I beat the rush and there were only a handful of people in the clearance aisles.  I found some ornaments, stockings, and other random Christmas decorations that Wifey had on her Honey-Do list to pick up.\u000a\u000aI'm glad I came early because after 15 minutes the aisles were packed with maniacs grabbing everything and shoving it into the carts.  It was like a swarm of locusts....nothing was left in their wake!  Luckily for me I had already found everything she wanted and took off for the registers.\u000a\u000aThe registers were full of the Holiday sales herd with hundreds of items in their carts.  Because of this situation It was a longer than usual wait at the line for the cashier.  The employees took it in stride and were very pleasant and efficient.  Overall, it wasn't too bad.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Hopefully not during one of these sales.

VLocated inside the Hyatt Gainey Ranch hotel, The Better Half and I stumbled across this place one night.  It was a pleasant surprise.  There were so many things on the menu that caught our eye.  We decided to go with:\u000a\u000aThree different types of Bruschetta:\u000a- Arrabiata (Spicy Tomatoes, Olives & Garlic), $4\u000a- Peperonata (Roasted Peppers, Capers & Basil), $4\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale?select=TmZ6hTHPUtcTFDIs3QR3oQ#TmZ6hTHPUtcTFDIs3QR3oQ\u000a\u000a- Fagioli (Cannellini Beans, Crispy Prosciutto), $4\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale?select=bYJOjgNiWW6yeWXsy_IXaQ#bYJOjgNiWW6yeWXsy_IXaQ\u000a\u000aEntrees:\u000aFettuccine alla Bolognese (Fettuccine w/Veal and Pork \u000aShank Ragout), $22\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale?select=wvuSD4YdYIc5r_eENfRE8Q#wvuSD4YdYIc5r_eENfRE8Q\u000a\u000aAnatra in Agro-Dolce (Duck Breast, Roasted Baby Vegetables\u000awith Sweet & Sour Roasted Duck Leg, Pine Nuts \u000aSultanas and a Honey Herb Sauce), $27\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale?select=vYEXJIcrxfCh4-cgl5AJlg#vYEXJIcrxfCh4-cgl5AJlg\u000a\u000aSide Dish\u000aRisotto w/Parmesan Cheese & Parsley, $7\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale?select=LHXaImmzdoKPh0qcB9Td5Q#LHXaImmzdoKPh0qcB9Td5Q\u000a\u000aDessert\u000aCreme Brulee\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale?select=pDHJTf0_B-ToAMq8VCuXFA#pDHJTf0_B-ToAMq8VCuXFA\u000a\u000aIt sounds like a lot of food, but it wasn't too bad.  The portions are not over the top huge.  Out of the 3 Bruschettas we tried, my favorite was the Fagioli.  It was totally different than anything I've tried before.  The Beans went very well with the Prosciutto and Bread.\u000a\u000aThe Fettuccine all Bolognese was awesome....very rich though.  The Veal & Pork Shank Ragout was what made it rich and full of flavor.  I had a bite of The Better Half's Anatra and it was good too.  The side of Risotto went perfectly with our meal.\u000a\u000aI was only able to get a small bite out of TBH's Creme Brulee....she doesn't like to share her Dessert, ha!  It was delish....next time, we'll order less Bruschetta so I can get one for myself.\u000a\u000aService was outstanding during the entire meal.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 85%

It's kept me very warm and comfortable.\u000a\u000aThe employees at this REI are always helpful and answer all of my stupid questions.

VI've never stayed here before, but I've attended a couple of events in the conference area and used the parking lot for Coyotes games.  Some thing you should know....Self parking garage costs $$$, so does valet.  It varies based on the event, so be sure to check ahead of time.\u000a\u000aThe hotel lobby and amenities are nice for attending a conference.  Their meeting rooms are spacious and well appointed.  Their staff is well trained and helpful too.\u000a\u000aAlthough I haven't stayed in the rooms, I recommend this place to friends and family who visit from out of town to watch Coyotes & Cardinals games because it's so convenient to the Arena/Stadium.  They've always been happy with their stay, so I continue to recommend.\u000a\u000aOne of these days I will take my own advice and stay there on a game weekend, perhaps next Fiesta Bowl...?\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VAfter a subpar Rubio's experience at another location last week, I decided to give this location a try because I was craving Mexican food for lunch.

VHad an early morning flight to Philadelphia this morning.  Didn't get a chance to grab a bite to eat before I left the house, so I stopped by Flatbreadz.\u000a\u000aI decided to get 2 toaste Sesame Seed Bagels w/cream cheese.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that the bagels were pretty fresh.  They toasted it just right too....not too burnt, but not undercooked either.  I would have rated them 4 Stars, but the cream cheese was a fluffy cream cheese and didn't have much taste....must have been fat-free or something like that....which is a bummer because I like full-flavored cream cheese.\u000a\u000aThe employees were friendly and the place was clean.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  If I'm in the A Gate area, sure.

VTried to be healthy and get a bite to eat here instead of the junk food restaurants at the airport.  Only one person in line ahead of me, 4 employees doing nothing, I waited 5 minutes, got frustrated, and left.  Why 4 employees would waste people's time like that is beyond me.\u000a\u000aInstead I went to a Burrito place and overpaid for a boatload of calories I didn't need.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I might have caught them on an off day, so I will try to come here again next time.  For now, 2 Stars.

VThe sister property of Wynn Las Vegas, this place is an extension of the Wynn's crown jewel.  It shares many of the same qualities as the other property.  The towers look identical from the outside, but the rooms at Encore are slightly better than Wynn.\u000a\u000aI like to take clients and associates here for dinner or drinks as it is a great place to conduct business and have a good time.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet.

VStopped by for lunch with a fellow Yelper the other day.  Heard this was an organic healthy, Vegan & Vegetarian hangout.....that also served the Carnivores, so I was eager to give it a try and see what it feels like to be a Vegan in a Steakhouse (since I'm a Carnivore).  \u000a\u000aThis was one of the most difficult reviews for me to write.  This place has so much potential.....I wish there was a 1/2 Star system because I want to give it 3.5 Stars and was on the fence for 3 or 4 Stars, here's why:\u000a\u000aThe menu is pretty extensive and has a lot of items that pique'd my interest, such as: Grilled Chicken Soft Tacos ($12.95), Buffalo Chicken Wrap ($7.99), Pepperoni Pizzetta ($8.95)....wait, what's a Pizzetta?  Turns out it's a Pizza.....come on, enough with the goofy names already, just call it a Pizza and call it a day!  A lot of stuff looked good and I was surprised at the number of items available for Carnivores....I ended up ordering their Fire Fries (Baked Fries topped with Hot Sauce, Pico de Gallo, Mozzarella & Cheddar Cheese $7) and a Chicken Panini (w/Buffalo Mozzarella, Tomato, Basil with Pesto $7.95).  The server asked if I wanted the Vegan Cheese on the Fire Fries....I passed and wanted the full monty.\u000a\u000aTo wash it down, I had some Iced Tea ($2.50)....which was awesome BTW.\u000a\u000aThe service was a bit slow.  It took some time for the waiter to take our order and the table next to us had to stop a busperson to get their order taken too.  It was 11:30 am and the lunch rush hadn't started yet, so I don't know what the issue was.  Anyway, it wasn't too bad but was borderline annoying.....another few minutes and it would have cost them a Star.\u000a\u000aOur food came out after a short wait and I was surprised to see how HUGE the Fire Fries were!  I thought this was suppose to be a "healthy" restaurant?!  LOL  For a minute I thought I was in Claim Jumper!  The Fries look too good, so I attacked them first.  The top layer of Fire Fries were awesome....baked well and had good flavor.  However.....the middle and bottom portion of the Fries were undercooked and semi-raw, not good.  Also, the cook didn't spread the ingredients throughout the dish.....the Hot Sauce and Pico de Gallo was only in one corner of the dish, buried under the top layer of Cheese.  The other 3/4 of the dish was only melted Cheese and the Fries.  This was a damn shame because the portion with all of the ingredients was awesome!  The rest of it was just so/so.  He/she needs a lesson in making a consistent dish.\u000a\u000aThe Chicken Panini was next.....after I took one bite I realized I made a big mistake.  The combination of Fire Fries and the Chicken Panini wasn't good.  The sharp, spicy flavor of the Fire Fries overwhelmed my taste buds so when I ate my Chicken Panini it tasted bland.  This is not the restaurant's fault, but mine.  So my review of the Panini is incomplete.  The side Salad with Balsamic Vinaigrette was awesome though.  \u000a\u000aAnother note....the Panini came with Whole Grain Bread as a default....I wasn't given an option for any other type of Bread, but saw other people with Panini's with what appeared to be White Bread....wish I had the choice.\u000a\u000aOverall, this place has a lot of potential.  That's what made it so difficult for me to rate it....the 1/4 of the Fries that had all of the ingredients and were cooked thoroughly tasted awesome but the raw Potatoes in the middle was a turn off.  For now they get 4 Stars for their Vegan/Vegetarian menu options and the potential of their Fire Fries.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I will someday to try a couple more items that intrigued me.

Together both of our cups weighed in at $8.69....not bad.\u000a\u000aI put together Double Cookies & Cream, Chocolate Truffle, and New York Cheesecake with Peanuts & Cumbled Reese Peanut Buttercup for toppings...(see pics).....it was awesome!\u000a\u000aThe best part was that there was nobody in line.  Normally this place is a madhouse with a line out the door.  We came at the right time (2:30 pm) I guess.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet Yo-gurt I will!

VMet a business associate here for a breakfast meeting the other day.  I rarely come to this Cracked Egg location, but it was convenient at the time.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Short Stack (2 giant Pankcakes).  They were very good, as usual.  The Cracked Egg rarely disappoints.  This location was very busy when we were here on a Friday morning.  However, the server kept up with the craziness and we were well taken care of.  We also took our time since we were there to discuss business matters....not once were we felt unwelcome because we were taking our time.\u000a\u000aOverall, great service, great food.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet.

VIt's been at least 5 or 6 years since the last time I visited this joint.  I worked at the Eldorado Casino back in the mid 90's and this place use to have decent food......that was back when it was named "Cactus Joe's".  It's really gone downhill since those days.\u000a\u000aI happened to be in the area and stopped by for lunch with my Mom.  I ordered the Nachos w/o Meat and Mom ordered the Fish & Chips special.\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait we were served our food.  I was disappointed to see that the Nachos were Chips, Cheese Whiz, Tomatoes, Onions on a plate with a small bowl of Beans, cup of Guacamole, cup of Salsa, and two packages of Sour Cream on the side......what the ___?  Was I suppose to create this thing myself?  Where did it say that on the menu?  I know why they did it.....to save money.  There's less food waste when you do stuff like that, but seriously?\u000a\u000aAs a fan of Nachos it was a huge letdown.....plus they didn't taste good at all.  The Chips weren't fresh and the flavors were just strange.....unappealing.\u000a\u000aMom enjoyed her Fish & Chips, which were really Fish & Fries.  She liked her Fish and I tried a few Fries...they weren't bad.  Maybe I ordered the wrong item?\u000a\u000aOverall, the service was good and since Mom enjoyed her dish I'm giving this place 2 Stars instead of 1.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Someday I probably will for the sake of nostalgia....but I predict it won't happen any time soon.

VWorking late one night, I was looking for some Pizza delivery and found this place on Yelp.  After browsing their menu online, I decided to order a 14" Brooklyn Family Pizza (Sausage, Pepperoni, Basil, $15.79) well done.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WScGH9XsG8-XF_HLqviAgw?select=tJ6uKGCt903Th6DBV33z4g\u000a\u000aThe Pizza was delivered pretty quickly and I couldn't wait to take a bite.  The Pizza looked sooo good!\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WScGH9XsG8-XF_HLqviAgw?select=RbJzxEMNjbizWpuurVp5lg\u000aWhen I picked up a Slice, it had that NY Pizza "bend" to it.....good sign!\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WScGH9XsG8-XF_HLqviAgw?select=p1vayQYRY2Eync2nFsXo8Q\u000aI took a bite and it was good!  The Sausage had a nice combination of Sweet & Spicy flavors and went well with the Pepperoni.  The Cheese was gooey and the Basil was just right...I think I'm going to add Basil to my standard order of Pepperoni & Sausage if a Pizza joint offers it.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WScGH9XsG8-XF_HLqviAgw?select=Mi2V4PgUyxU-PQGwDQRBtA\u000a\u000aOverall, I was very satisfied with NYPD Pizza!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VWe had a couple of Deal Chicken coupons for this joint, so we came on back to back Sundays to redeem.  This was the first time I dined in.  Normally, we order delivery.  I can tell you that dining in is a very good experience.  The server remembered us from the week before and greeted us with a warm hello and smile.  Her name is Ashley and she's awesome.  She made sure we were well taken care of and that our drink glasses were always full.\u000a\u000aAnother standout  employee is one of the cooks.  I didn't get his name, but he took the Pizza out of the oven and brought it to our table before he cut it to make sure it was cooked to our desired crispiness.  We like our Pizza well-done and he wouldn't slice it up until we gave him the thumbs up.  Both visits we didn't have to send it back, they got the crispiness done properly the first time.\u000a\u000aWe ordered:\u000a\u000aFamily sized Brooklyn Family Pizza (Pepperoni, Sausage, Basil), $21.49\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-5?select=Q61H5MQsP_7pOjeVF_DwFg#Q61H5MQsP_7pOjeVF_DwFg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-5?select=prumSXcrD0Eozq3Rx7pWVQ#prumSXcrD0Eozq3Rx7pWVQ\u000a\u000aFamily sized Mott Street Meat Lover Pizza (Pepperoni, Sausage, Meatball), $21.99\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-5?select=63hD4U7PKOLnonxA--8XAQ#63hD4U7PKOLnonxA--8XAQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-5?select=pO92ZpZdDaN1LGtSCi_KnA#pO92ZpZdDaN1LGtSCi_KnA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-5?select=XdIo9EZWyEgtcCQmqmI_gg#XdIo9EZWyEgtcCQmqmI_gg\u000a\u000aChicken Wings, $8.99\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-5?select=Zc5dliKkTzXw1arLmXSf-w#Zc5dliKkTzXw1arLmXSf-w\u000a\u000aGarlic Cheese Knots, $4.99\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-5?select=uW_tFc4M2RIs8KG6QWS2FA#uW_tFc4M2RIs8KG6QWS2FA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-5?select=5p3iujrt6uR9OkTX51GZRQ#5p3iujrt6uR9OkTX51GZRQ\u000a\u000aEverything was good.  The Pizza is awesome of course.  I'm a huge fan of their Pizza.  The Wings are OK, not great.  The Garlic Cheese Knots are outstanding, which surprised me.  They're not really "knots", but more like a fluffy dinner roll covered with Melted Cheese, Butter, and Garlic....pure heaven!  Once you have one, you can't stop eating them.\u000a\u000aOverall, the dine-in experience was awesome.

VWas getting my car washed next door and wanted to grab a bite to eat.  Since I love BBQ, this was an easy decision for me to give this place a shot.  After browsing the menu, I decided to try:\u000a4 oz BBQ Beef Brisket Sandwich, $4.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z8Em-bhZI3Mmspml7tj6tg?select=Erry3muhVFQdFZQPCJRHzw\u000a2 oz Hot Link Sandwich, $3\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z8Em-bhZI3Mmspml7tj6tg?select=qxTdcqqimxhFcmoW1Iyj9g\u000aI got them both "dressed", which means they give you Onions & Pickles on the side to put on the Sandwich.\u000a\u000aNext to the Soda Fountain, there are vats of Hot & Mild BBQ Sauce for self service.  I of course went for the Hot BBQ Sauce.\u000a\u000aThe food is delivered to your table when it's ready.  I went for the Hot Link Sandwich first and didn't put any Hot BBQ Sauce on it so that I could taste the natural Spiciness of the Hot Link.....well, I was disappointed, it's not very hot at all.  Damn, the search for real BBQ Hot Link Sandwiches continues.\u000a\u000aNext, I went for the BBQ Beef Brisket Sammie.....I poured some Hot BBQ Sauce and added the Onions & Pickles to it.  It's not a bad Sandwich.....pretty good.  I thought the Bread was a bit blah....like grocery store Bread......a nice Italian or French Roll would have been better with it.  The Beef was tender and juicy and had a slightly smoky flavor to it.  I prefer it to have a bit more flavor to it, but like how they serve you the Sandwich dry and allow you to put your own BBQ Sauce on it.\u000a\u000aThe Hot BBQ Sauce was pretty spicy......really enjoyed that a lot.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a pretty good experience.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 71%

VAfter we attended the gun show at the stadium, we dropped by here for some lunch.  After browsing the menu, I ordered:\u000a\u000aBig Dad Pork Sandwich\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shanes-rib-shack-glendale?select=uaownUdFQGAKZaJG7WVUVA#uaownUdFQGAKZaJG7WVUVA\u000a\u000aCole Slaw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shanes-rib-shack-glendale?select=B_42MFpwDqaXiCEkn1253A#B_42MFpwDqaXiCEkn1253A\u000a\u000aWhile we were waiting for our food, I noticed that there was a some BBQ sauce bottles by the drink station.  I wandered over there and grabbed a bottle of the Spicy and a bottle of the Mustard BBQ sauces.\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait, we got our food and I put a little of the Spicy BBQ sauce on the Sandwich and took a bite.  First of all, the Spicy BBQ sauce is not spicy at all....it's not even mild or medium....there's more spice in regular black pepper.  The next bite I tried the Mustard BBQ sauce...that one had some good flavor to it and added to the meal, so I used it for the remainder of the meal.  The Big Dad comes with Texas Toast as the bread for the Sandwich and it helped hold it together well.  Overall, it was average.\u000a\u000aThe Cole Slaw I ordered for my side was ok...not as creamy as I prefer, but it was ok.\u000a\u000aI'm a fan of BBQ and this place didn't leave me wanting more, thus the average 3 Star rating.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 30%

VMy family and I enjoy shopping at Fresh & Easy.  The food is always fresh and tasty.  This store is convenient because it's on the way home from the gym.\u000a\u000aThe only reason why I gave this store 4 Stars is because of it's size and selection.  I realize that Fresh & Easy stores are not meant to be large, so I guess I will never rate a Fresh & Easy 5 Stars.  I think a supermarket should have more options than the few that Fresh & Easy have.  Although it earned 4 Stars because the few items they have are very good.

While I was there, I couldn't help myself....the Beer & Wine aisle was calling me, so I stopped by and picked up some Stella, Dos XX, and Big Kahuna....damn, why can't I just get in/out of this place?\u000a\u000aI enjoy shopping here and will return soon.

VThe crazy State of Arizona has this stupid rule that you have to get a smog check from one of their ADEQ centers (Arizona Department of Environmental Quality).  Well, I took one of my cars there to go through the tests....it failed because the Service Engine light was on....what?!  Why?  What does that have to do with anything?  \u000a\u000aOk, so I go to a mechanic and he fixes it and resets the light.  3 days later, I go back to the ADEQ center and it fails again!  Why?  Because they said that the computer in the car is "not ready"....what?  What's that?!  To get an answer, I have to park my car and go inside an office...out comes a manager and he says that the computer in my car is not "reset and ready" and so I have to wait until it is before I come back.  \u000a\u000aPerplexed, I asked..."how will I know when it's ready"?\u000a\u000aHe says..."I don't know, ask the mechanic".\u000a\u000aI say..."wait, I have to go back and ask him when it's ready"?\u000a\u000aHe says..."well, that's the only way you will know for sure.  The other option is that you drive around for a few days and hope that the car's computer is ready and then bring it back in for a test.  However, if it fails again, you will have to take it to a location in downtown Phoenix and have a mechanic check it out...it's not convenient or cheap".\u000a\u000aI leave extremely frustrated and angry.  Smog Checks are a scam.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - Unfortunately, I'm forced to do this every time my car registration is due...100%

VMom wanted a Burger for lunch, so we decided to head to Red Robin.  It's in our neighborhood and it's been a while since we were last here.   We like this place because of the variety of Burgers they have on the menu.  It's pretty extensive and creative.  The Bleu Ribbon Burger (Bleu Cheese, Chipotle Mayo, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion Strings, Onion Bun), $9.79 immediately jumped out at me when I browsed the menu, so I went for it.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jBs2HmEOkqCvdHNnw3N-og?select=LX8XzvXLi__N_8hn2EPUdQ\u000aMom went for a Turkey Burger....she's been on a Turkey Burger kick lately.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jBs2HmEOkqCvdHNnw3N-og?select=zD0Th0NI9ydO5MA2DogVmg\u000a\u000aThe service was excellent, as usual, and the food came out quickly.  We requested our Burgers to be cut in half and they got it right.  I took one bite out of my Bleu Ribbon Burger and instantly became a fan....yum!  The Bleu Cheese and Onion Straws gave the Burger a unique flavor that tasted soooo good.  It left me wanting more when I was finished....which is the tell-tale sign for me that I enjoyed the grub.\u000a\u000aOverall, the experience was very good.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VI've been to this location several times for various events.  Most recently I was there to meet a friend.  My friends and I love BWW because of the FREE Wireless Internet.   it allows us to work while we play.\u000a\u000aIt only gets 3 Stars in my book because the food is ok....nothing special.  Also, their beer is so/so.  The last visit I had their Wheat Beer and it was kind of blah...not much flavor to it.  I switched it up to Blue Moon after one glass.  i can get Blue Moon anywhere else.\u000a\u000aThey get bonus points for their service at this location...it was pretty solid.  However, the tables in the bar area were pretty nasty.  There was a huge layer of "gunk" on the table we were sitting at....so bad that the napkin under my beer stuck to the table.  It was gross.  They lost 1 Star because of that.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Yeah, because I have friends who like this location.  There are better locations in town.

VI don't know what it is about this location, but it's not as good as the others.  I come here because a friend of mine comes here regularly, but I wouldn't come to this BWW otherwise.\u000a\u000aMy last visit was this past Thursday evening.  I was waiting for my friend in the bar and wanted to order a Ranger IPA.  I was told they didn't carry IPA on tap or bottled.....WTH?  The other location on North Durango & 215 has two IPA's on tap.....I was there 2 weeks ago, so I know they carry it.  I asked the waiter if they recently stopped selling IPA's and he said he didn't know and didn't even know what an IPA beer was!  I settled on a 24 oz Newcastle and put away 4 or 5 before the night was over.\u000a\u000aWow, I thought that BWW's were suppose to be consistent with their product.  I guess I was wrong.....whatever.\u000a\u000aWill I come back?  Only when I come to visit my friend, otherwise I wouldn't come to this location.  There are better BWW's in Vegas.

VThis place is ridiculously awesome.  Easily the best golf course in Las Vegas.\u000a\u000aThe course is in immaculate condition and the best part is that there is nobody on the course besides your group and your caddies.  I won't do this course any justice with this review as I don't have the words to describe it.\u000a\u000aThe course is sunk below street level, so you can't see any signs of being in Las Vegas.  All you see on the horizon are trees and mountain tops.\u000a\u000aThe greens are very fast and always in perfect condition.\u000a\u000aThere are two houses on the property.  One is the former residence of Steve Wynn and the other was owned by a former senior executive of Mirage Resorts (before the MGM acquisition).\u000a\u000aThe golf course is very challenging....bring your "A" game.  It's not like the other courses in Las Vegas, which are desert landscaped and more like target golf......this is a traditional course and if you didn't know you were in the middle of a desert city, you wouldn't realize it while you were playing.\u000a\u000aDo not pass on an opportunity to play here.

VI love this Terrible's location.....why?  Here's why:\u000a\u000aPROS\u000a- It's in my neighborhood & conveniently located so I can stop by for gas on my way back from most parts of the Valley.\u000a\u000a- Use of the car vacuum cleaners are FREE.\u000a\u000a- The car wash services.  It's a typical Terrible Herbst medium  sized car wash setup.\u000a\u000a- They have oil change & other minor car maintenance services.\u000a\u000aCONS\u000a- I can't really think of one.\u000a\u000aI come here mostly for the gas & vacuum cleaning.  I have other Terrible locations that I prefer for the oil change services.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Yep!

VWas jonesing for a Burger and decided to go to Fuddrucker's.  I love this place.  I would come here with a couple of friends at least once a month when we all worked together.....but that was a couple of years ago, so it was time to see an old friend.\u000a\u000aWhen I pulled up, I was surprised to see a sign advertising Free WiFi....perfect, now I found a new place to study!\u000a\u000aAfter a few minutes I decided to go with the 1/3 lb Burger Combo ($9.99) and a 1/2 lb Burger ($5.99).  I ordered American Cheese ($.75) on one and Pepper Jack ($.75) on the other.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AL5YzikrmxwcBzBNLGO7Jw?select=Fctoo65ZB1jpFxM1_zpamg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AL5YzikrmxwcBzBNLGO7Jw?select=_PZGFceSYTI1jygSRi5N6A\u000a\u000aOne of the things I love about Fuddrucker's is the fresh toppings bar where you can load up whatever you want on your Burger.  I decided to put Onions, Jalapenos, Mayo, and Mustard.  I also got some melted Jalapeno Cheddar Cheese for dipping my Fries.\u000a\u000aThe Burgers were tasty of course and the Fries were perfect!  The combo came with a Soda and I went with Coke Zero.....I'm not a Soda drinker, but I think I'm becoming addicted to Coke Zero.....have to stop that soon.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was another great meal @ Fuddrucker's!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 93.5%

VNot a bad place to get your car washed.  The wait isn't too bad and it's not as busy as some of the other locations around town.  The convenience store is great too with a nice selection of Snacks to grub on while you wait.

VTime for a review update.  Until I joined Clean Freak's monthly car wash program, I was here every few months or so to get my car washed.  Then, the scandal broke and I stopped coming here altogether because I didn't want people to think I was supporting their activities.  \u000a\u000aIf they clean up their reputation, I will probably come back.

VCame here with the Better Half to celebrate her Birthday.  The restaurant came highly recommended by a friend, and we noticed that they had Foie Gras on the menu (her fave) so we decided to check it out.  \u000a\u000aWe reviewed the menu before we got to the restaurant and decided to order:\u000a\u000aRoasted Foie Gras Prepared Sous Vide - $110 \u000aSmoked Truffle-Infused Filet Mignon - $38\u000a\u000aFor sides - $8 each:\u000a\u000aMac n' Cheese au Gratin w/ Ham\u000aGnocchi\u000aPotatoes Au Gratin\u000a\u000aThe server took the order and came back a few minutes later to tell us that they're out of Foie Gras.  We were extremely disappointed and surprised....especially since there were 3 items on the menu that had Foie Gras as the main ingredient and the place wasn't packed.  \u000a\u000aIn an attempt to save the day, the server checked with the kitchen and came back and said there was a small piece of Foie Gras left for the Appetizer but that he could prepare it like the entree.  Since we came all the way down here for the dish, we agreed.\u000a\u000aWhile we were waiting for our dinner, our Bread and Water was never refilled and we had to pour our own Wine.  For a restaurant like this, we didn't expect that kind of service.\u000a\u000aThe food arrived...the Filet was decent, but not great.  Not as tender as I usually like it.  The highlight was the Gnocchi.  The Better Half said her Foie Gras tasted a little funny.  She didn't finish her serving.\u000a\u000aOverall, the experience was sub-par.  The server's attempt to save the day kept us from giving this place 1 Star.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 5%

VSince moving to the area 2 yrs ago, I've passed by this building dozens of times.  The large, white sails are hard to miss.  However, I never knew what was located here....until recently when one of the companies we do business with scheduled a meeting at their office to review their products and services with our team.  I had no idea these buildings housed businesses....I thought it was an extension of ASU and that college kids went to school here.  \u000a\u000aI have to admit that I was excited to finally come check out this place.  When I arrived, I was disappointed to see that parking was so difficult.  There are very few parking spots between each building and many with restrictions.  The buildings are not well marked either, so it was a bit difficult finding the right building once I parked.\u000a\u000aWhen I finally walked inside, I was pleased to see a modern building that was well ventilated.  There were a lot of young people who looked like students walking around, so I'm not sure if there's a college campus here.\u000a\u000aThe building gets 4 Stars, the parking 2 Stars.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

This Sandwich was huge!  In addition to that, it comes with a large pile of skinny Fries.  The Club Sandwich was very good.....and the Fries were outstanding.  I could eat a large plate of those Fries.\u000a\u000aThe service was great as well.  Overall, a pleasant "working" lunch experience.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VOur Son asked us to stop here so he could buy a birthday gift for his friend.  I had no clue this place existed, but I'm glad he knew about it.\u000a\u000aIt has a ton of comics.  I browsed around while my Son went searching for the birthday present.  I could spend hours in this joint!  Since The Better Half (TBH) was waiting in the car, we only had a few minutes.....but it didn't take long once he asked for help.  The staff was very friendly and made sure he found what he was looking for.  He purchased 5 Ghost Rider Comic Books.\u000a\u000aWhen we got back to the car, I asked him which friend this was for....he said Kristen.  In a shocked voice I said "Are you sure Kristen will like this gift?!".....he said "Yeah Dad, she loves comics."......I told him to marry her.  He laughed and said I was crazy.  Oh well, he'll regret it later.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Next time without TBH so I can "waste some time" looking around, ha!

VOne of my favorite places in Town Square.  My wife and I go to Grape Vegas (new name) at least once a month.  We go and enjoy a glass of wine or two...or three.\u000a\u000aFood - The food is very good and goes well with their selection of wine.  We usually get a cheese plate or a salad.  We normally don't eat a full blown meal here.  We are here for the wine more than the food.\u000a\u000aWine - There is a good selection of wine to choose from and all of the staff are knowledgeable and can help you find one that suits your taste.\u000a\u000aService - The service is outstanding.  They go over and above to ensure you have a good experience.  Stop by and say hello to Max.\u000a\u000aAtmosphere - This is our favorite part of Grape Vegas.  The bar & inside seating is very comfortable and chic.  Outdoor seating is an option as well....which is rare in Vegas.  It's located next to the Rave Movie Theaters, so it's a great place to hang out while your kids are at the movies....*hint*\u000a\u000aWill I return?  If the 5 Star rating wasn't a clue....of course!

VA friend visited from out of town and suggested we meet here for drinks.  We came here two nights in a row, Wed/Thu.  On Wed night, the lobby bar was dead with 2 or 3 people there.  On Thu night, the lobby bar had a few more people, but was still a blah place to hang.  So we decided to check out the pool bar, which we were told was a better scene.\u000a\u000aWe headed up to the pool, which is on the 2nd floor, and ordered a couple of drinks.  The waitress was very friendly and fast with our drinks.  However, the pool wasn't really happening either.....there were maybe 20 or 30 people there at 9 pm.\u000a\u000aSince the scene was slow, we took off after a round.  I hear the pool parties on the weekends are epic.....so, I will be back for sure.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VTime for a review update.  Ever since Maya opened up, we haven't come to the W as much anymore because it's kind of lost it's luster.  It used to be a happening spot, but most of the crowd has moved on to the newer spots opened in Old Town.\u000a\u000aA few friends decided to have a bachelor party here and ended up spending thousands of dollars over a weekend.  At the end of the weekend, we all determined that we could've went to Vegas and got much more for the dollars than we did here.  Room rates for the group averaged over $250 and drinks, food, and cabana rental pushed it up even higher.  In Vegas, we have hookups that could've easily got us all that for much less.\u000a\u000aHopefully one day it returns to what it once was.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VI love this place and so do my clients and colleagues who are downtown.  They never hesitate when I book a lunch meeting here.  There are so many interesting items on the menu, but my favorite is the Chef's Trio.  The last visit, this is what was on the Trio:\u000a\u000aChef Trio (Beef Soup, Potato Salad w/Bacon, Veggie Calzone), $10\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/district-american-kitchen-and-wine-bar-phoenix-2?select=g6iPj5WpOU-IUMDzdGwXTw#g6iPj5WpOU-IUMDzdGwXTw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/district-american-kitchen-and-wine-bar-phoenix-2?select=q-jiqBVGITDHYrfW2nwkhQ#q-jiqBVGITDHYrfW2nwkhQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/district-american-kitchen-and-wine-bar-phoenix-2?select=BJBGLXK8LcaZtear6hwTOQ#BJBGLXK8LcaZtear6hwTOQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/district-american-kitchen-and-wine-bar-phoenix-2?select=4E90w9JyCNDGIJ2szOhhtg#4E90w9JyCNDGIJ2szOhhtg\u000a\u000aI started with the Beef Soup, which was simply AMAZING!  The Beef was of high quality and full of flavor.  Just the right portion size too.  Next I had the Veggie Calzone....I have to admit, I was a little skeptical of that part of the dish, but they delivered....it was awesome.  The best part of the dish though was the Potato Salad w/Bacon.....that's right folks, it has BACON in it!!!  It tastes as good as it sounds.  The Bacon does not overwhelm the flavor of the Potato Salad, it compliments it.  It also has very sharp flavors and rounds out the trio dish well.  Well done chef, well done!\u000a\u000aI can't wait until our next lunch downtown!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

VAnother awesome Mexican restaurant within a couple of miles of our house....this place is pretty awesome.  I don't know why it took me so long to try it out....perhaps because it's kind of tucked away out of sight in a shopping mall that doesn't generally get a lot of traffic...?  I don't know....but one thing I do know is that it's no on my radar and I will be back many times.  Here's my Son and I had on our first visit:\u000a\u000aCarnitas de Jalisco, $9.99\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=hs9izE2KQH42bIhX2k2tPw#hs9izE2KQH42bIhX2k2tPw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=873KJQLaeB5FKuPMB3jC8Q#873KJQLaeB5FKuPMB3jC8Q\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=yewf-V6M-eviSlnMFN_klg#yewf-V6M-eviSlnMFN_klg\u000a\u000aBuenos Nachos w/Ground Beef, $6.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=ZLUrrPL1RDSqhkQvkzRmtw#ZLUrrPL1RDSqhkQvkzRmtw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=yi__pt7IXqW10j9yHcOFPA#yi__pt7IXqW10j9yHcOFPA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=aOWIlXAmRLOPY72He5rTfw#aOWIlXAmRLOPY72He5rTfw\u000a\u000aCarne Asada Taco, $2.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=8LpgSd1OL903W82t13JOrQ#8LpgSd1OL903W82t13JOrQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=u38XVbgVvK3uG9jgrPQjdA#u38XVbgVvK3uG9jgrPQjdA\u000a\u000aMy Son ordered the Carnitas and I asked him for a few bites so I could sample the plate...it was very good, nice flavor.  Beans and Rice complimented it well.\u000a\u000aI had the Nachos and the Carne Asada Taco.  The Nachos were awesome....the did a great job with this dish.  It's Spicy and has a ton of flavor....portion size is big too.  They serve it on a Pizza dish....I think that's the trend now as this is at least the 2nd or 3rd place I've seen Nachos served on a Pizza dish.  Before moving to the Scottsdale area, I'd never seen that.  Back to the food....\u000a\u000aThe Carne Asada Taco was OK...it was the only dish that disappointed.  They do something different here with it....they add Lettuce....a lot of Lettuce....too much Lettuce (see pics above).  I think the Lettuce overwhelmed the flavor of the Taco....if I order this again, I will either order it without the Lettuce or take it off before I eat it.\u000a\u000aThe service here is good too.  We asked for very Spicy Salsa instead of the normal one they give you with your dish and they came back with a Habanero based Salsa....it had a serious kick to it.  It was nice to have that option.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 92%

VStopped in here for lunch to grab a quick bite before a college football game on Saturday.  I've been here many times.  On this last visit, I ordered a 6" Italian Sub.\u000a\u000aYou order the Sandwich from the cashier and you receive a number, then a server brings out the order to your table.  Very convenient.  Since it's located next to the SuperBook, there are plenty of Plasma TVs with sporting events and horse racing to keep you distracted while you wait for your food.  There's also a ton of seating, so you'll be sure to find a place to sit unlike many of the sportsbook delis in Vegas.\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait our food was ready.  The Meat & toppings were fresh.  This Deli advertises that they use Boar's Head Deli Meats, so that's always a plus....I love Boar's Head products.  Although it was only a 6" Sandwich, it was very filling.\u000a\u000aOverall, great experience & great service.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Of course!

VAfter a long day walking the convention floor at CES, a few friends and I decided to have dinner here at The Buffet.  I've been here several times and have my favorite dishes.  This evening, I opted for Pizza, Macaroni & Cheese, Fried Chicken, Hot Link Sausage, and for dessert a Slice of Blueberry Pie.\u000a\u000aThe food is pretty good.  My favorite is the Fried Chicken and Mac n Cheese.  The Chicken has a nice, crispy & flaky skin to it with the white meat tender and juicy in the inside.  The Mac n Cheese is thick and gooey....nom nom!\u000a\u000aSince it was dinner, they had the small bar open, so I had some Oktoberfest Beer to wash it all down....this was complimentary, bonus!\u000a\u000aOverall, we had a good dinner with great service.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Sure.

VOne of the few Asian shopping centers in the Phoenix metro area.  There's an Asian market, various restaurants (Thai, Vietnamese, Boba, Chinese), and a few retail shops.  It doesn't have the selection or energy of the Chinatown markets in Vegas, LA, or Orange County.  Kind of shocking actually when you consider that there are 3x more people in Phoenix than Vegas.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%  Where else am I going to go for my Asian fix?

VI was in the area and dropped by to grab a bite to eat.  It looks like many of the Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area, so I was expecting it to be pretty good.  Boy was I disappointed!  Here's what I ordered:\u000a\u000aCarne Asada Taco, $3.25\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/polibertos-phoenix?select=T9aXK2Wj3MhupooxqD_k4Q#T9aXK2Wj3MhupooxqD_k4Q\u000a\u000aCarnitas Taco, $2.65\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/polibertos-phoenix?select=GamyRxhVKMb4tbQR-ss9jw#GamyRxhVKMb4tbQR-ss9jw\u000a\u000aBeans, Rice, Cheese Burrito, $2.99 + $.065 (Rice)\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/polibertos-phoenix?select=ZOK8OWJR0DTI8bC0-kfSYw#ZOK8OWJR0DTI8bC0-kfSYw\u000a\u000aThe portion size is very large, so you get your money's worth as far as quantity, but the quality was terrible.\u000a\u000aI tried the Carnitas Taco first....took one bite and immediately didn't like it.  Why?  The Carnitas was "rubbery" and lacked flavor...it was bland.  It was so gross, I only took 2 bites hoping the 2nd would be better (it wasn't), so I didn't finish it.\u000a\u000aNext was the Carne Asada Taco....took one bite and was underwhelmed.  The Steak had a lot of fat and was "chewy".  It also didn't taste good to me and I didn't finish that either.\u000a\u000aLast was the Beans/Rice/Cheese Burrito.  I was hoping it would salvage my meal, but sadly it didn't.  It was very salty and the Beans tasted like they'd been sitting around for a while.  It didn't taste fresh.  The saltiness was very hard to overcome and I also didn't finish that portion.\u000a\u000aI threw way 1/2 of my meal....that's why I gave this place 2 Stars.  It was the worst I've had since moving to the Phoenix area.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 5%

VAfter a night of drinking with friends in Old Town, we walked over to the Mission to grab a bite to eat.  Although it was late for dinner by Scottsdale standards (9 pm), the place was packed.  We waited at the bar for our table and had a few cocktails.  After a short wait, we were seated.  \u000a\u000aWe browsed the menu while we were having cocktails, so we knew what we wanted.  I ordered the Steak Tacos ($12).  After a short wait they came out.  I took one bite and became a fan!  The quality of the ingredients was evident...the Tacos were delish.\u000a\u000aService was  pretty good as well.  The first thing I thought about after leaving the restaurant was coming back on a date night with the Wife.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VI've heard so much about this place, both on Yelp and from colleagues & clients.  So, I couldn't say no when a client setup a mid-afternoon meeting here.  It was a Friday around 2 pm and the place was dead when I arrived.  I think there were 2 tables of people and a couple sitting at the bar.  I saddled up to one of the high top tables near the bar.  When they arrived, we decided to order food:\u000a\u000aCauliflower Calabrese, $7.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hannys-phoenix-2?select=AynlqEIqWzqroBIohHdBtQ#AynlqEIqWzqroBIohHdBtQ\u000a\u000aPepperoni & Onion Pizza, $12\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hannys-phoenix-2?select=TfcOk88mLctj7An6P8Ujfg#TfcOk88mLctj7An6P8Ujfg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hannys-phoenix-2?select=5WP8r8BiTWxe41rLzqkN3w#5WP8r8BiTWxe41rLzqkN3w\u000a\u000aPanino (Prosciutto di Parma, Sopressata, Fontina Cheese, Arugula, Ciabatta Bread, Italian Vinaigrette), $10.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hannys-phoenix-2?select=Y1LbrCWk_0N8P3lKl-FGTA#Y1LbrCWk_0N8P3lKl-FGTA\u000a\u000aStrawberry Longcake\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hannys-phoenix-2?select=liJrOPp-ecTBfmXZeweMrA#liJrOPp-ecTBfmXZeweMrA\u000a\u000aThe Cauliflower Calabrese was very interesting....it was like a stir fry dish.  The Cauliflower was pretty good and flavorful...I like the texture of it.  The rest of it was *meh*.\u000a\u000aThe Pepperoni Pizza was pretty good.  It's very thin and while the portion looks large, it's not too bad if 1 person had it as their entree.  We split it up.\u000a\u000aOne of my clients had the Panino.  She said it was very good.\u000a\u000aWe all tried the Strawberry Longcake...which is divine!  It's a Strawberry Cake fused with Ice Cream and Strawberries and topped with Strawberry Drizzle, fresh Strawberries, and Whipped Cream.  Wow, this surprised us and blew us away.  What a nice surprise!\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a pretty cool joint.  I hear they have DJ's on the weekend and it turns into a pretty cool spot.  We'll have to come back and try that sometime.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VI participated in the Making Strides Against Breast Cancer Walk this past weekend.  I joined the crowd of over 10,000 people here at Tempe Beach Park for the festivities before/after the walk.  This park is large and easily accommodated the big crowd.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tempe-beach-park-tempe?select=p_wr37nWQioJtvltx-7p8g#p_wr37nWQioJtvltx-7p8g\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tempe-beach-park-tempe?select=3stZNdmrfok1BCQWnvpruQ#3stZNdmrfok1BCQWnvpruQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tempe-beach-park-tempe?select=AG8uinJ79JQFyVAo_8QATA#AG8uinJ79JQFyVAo_8QATA\u000a\u000aParking was easy, with lots at the park plus parking garages nearby.  The weather was perfect and the walk was a lot of fun.  The best part of the walk was the final 3/4 mile which was down along the lake back to the park....very cool.\u000a\u000aI would come back for another large event or just to hang out and watch all of the boats in the water.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VMy business partner and I stop in here from time to time to meet and have a few drinks.  It's a beautiful property, but it was built at the wrong time.  It opened during the start of the recession and the area around it is full of foreclosures.....which means this place is always dead when we're here.\u000a\u000aDespite the low business volume, it's still a fun place to come.  The employees are friendly and you can always find a seat at the bar or get a table in a restaurant.  I don't think we've ever had to wait any more than a few minutes for a table.\u000a\u000aMy buddy likes to gamble and he loves the video poker machines here.  He's pretty lucky and says he's "beating the house".....yeah right.\u000a\u000aI really like how clean they keep this place, so I'm sure I'll be back.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 75%

VGroupon introduced us to this joint several months ago.  Since then, I've continued to buy Groupons and visit....I can't believe they can stay open and offer such huge discounts.  This place is alway very busy, so be prepared for a bit of a wait if you come during peak dinner hours....5-7:30 pm.  Also, I'd recommend asking for a free standing table instead of the bench seated "community" tables because those tables are pretty close together and you won't have any privacy.\u000a\u000aSome menu items we've ordered are:\u000a\u000aVesuvius Burger, $12.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/indulge-burgers-and-more-scottsdale?select=jJ909hC-XqZDXPv-1kFXow#jJ909hC-XqZDXPv-1kFXow\u000a\u000aChicken Wings, $8.99\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/indulge-burgers-and-more-scottsdale?select=OrF_EvFDVGxE3ddqKtGXyw#OrF_EvFDVGxE3ddqKtGXyw\u000a\u000a1/2 Fries, 1/2 Onion Strings, $5\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/indulge-burgers-and-more-scottsdale?select=6y07slzhlZ4zTfxvR2QXkQ#6y07slzhlZ4zTfxvR2QXkQ\u000a\u000aSliders, $7.95 for 2....$3.50 for ea extra\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/indulge-burgers-and-more-scottsdale?select=12gc2N1b90utvafur4OwZg#12gc2N1b90utvafur4OwZg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/indulge-burgers-and-more-scottsdale?select=Jw8uFL4H3eNqSAclbCitbg#Jw8uFL4H3eNqSAclbCitbg\u000a\u000aCheeseburger, $9.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/indulge-burgers-and-more-scottsdale?select=YJWvGjFTpcofzXnLakslNQ#YJWvGjFTpcofzXnLakslNQ\u000a\u000aSonoran Burger, $13.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/indulge-burgers-and-more-scottsdale?select=3D5FpjhS4PIZ91D5e7u63g#3D5FpjhS4PIZ91D5e7u63g\u000a\u000aTurkey Burger, $9.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/indulge-burgers-and-more-scottsdale?select=BYH2HY6p7wKgo49a3LX24A#BYH2HY6p7wKgo49a3LX24A\u000a\u000aBy far, the best items on the menu are the Sonoran Burger, Vesuvius Burger, and the Wings.  A Vesuvius Burger is two patties of Beef stuffed with the Cheese inbetween the 2 so that the Cheese gets cooked/melted in the middle.  A Sonoran Burger is the same as a Vesuvius with the addition of Peanut Butter on top.....and that's what makes it so good, yum!  You have to be careful on your first bite though because the Cheese is piping hot and it will burn the hell out of your mouth!\u000a\u000aThe Wings are a suprise....they're pretty good, above average.\u000a\u000aThe rest of the menu are specialty Burgers or  you can create your own with select toppings, etc.  It's a pretty cool setup.\u000a\u000aThe servers are usually pretty friendly and attentive.  However, when they get really busy, service will slow down a bit.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 85%

VDropped by here after spending some time at it's sister property, Wild Horse Pass.  This place is smaller, but it was jam packed!  They had Karaoke going on the night I stopped by and the lounge was full of aspiring singers.  There wasn't very many open slot machines or spots at the tables.....and it was a Thursday night!  I wonder what it's like on the weekends?\u000a\u000aParking wasn't too bad and it was easy to get in/out of the place.  I'll definitely be back soon.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 88%

VI am a fan of Fox Restaurants and I've eaten here several times, but it's my least favorite out of the group.  It's not for a lack of trying...I've been here several times and it's always a popular place for clients and co-workers to meet for lunch.  Here's a list of items I've tried here:\u000a\u000aCheese Crisp - $9\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blanco-scottsdale?select=4hRGlNmDF3PPNkBfGKpq7g#4hRGlNmDF3PPNkBfGKpq7g\u000a\u000aBlanco Burger (Manchego Cheese, Bacon, Guacamole, Pico de Gallo & Chipotle Mayo) - $11\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blanco-scottsdale?select=w439choXzufQTiLC7juxyw#w439choXzufQTiLC7juxyw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blanco-scottsdale?select=QbDaV7AvPjVyOeWHe_Da4g#QbDaV7AvPjVyOeWHe_Da4g\u000a\u000aCarnitas Burrito - $13, Enchilada Style + $1\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blanco-scottsdale?select=ul-hW-7hknJCDcL4HphiRw#ul-hW-7hknJCDcL4HphiRw\u000a\u000aCarnitas Tacos - $11\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blanco-scottsdale?select=eU2AFEWc0_g97OoDIO0dGQ#eU2AFEWc0_g97OoDIO0dGQ\u000a\u000aThe dishes with the most flavor was the Blanco Burger and the Carnitas Tacos.  Other than that, the food was mostly just OK.  You do get complimentary Chips & Salsa which is pretty good and filling.  You definitely won't leave here hungry.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 65%

VThis hotel surprised me.  When a friend said he was staying here, I thought "why in the world would you choose to stay here?".  However, after seeing the rooms and property, this place is pretty nice.\u000a\u000aThe rooms are well appointed and a nice size.  The lobby bar area is also very nice and clean with plenty of space for having a business meeting or casual drink.\u000a\u000aParking is not bad either.  There's plenty of parking near the lobby and it feels safe to walk to/from your car.\u000a\u000aTheir rates are very reasonable as well and the location gives you great access to downtown Phoenix and the central part of the Valley.  I recommend this place to all my value minded friends who travel here on business.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VI don't know how I get suckered into the Grand Luxe Cafe, but I do.  It's a decent Vegas coffee shop type place, but more upscale and expensive, I get it.....but the food is always just so/so to me when I dine here.  My most recent visit, we ordered:\u000a\u000aSliders, $9.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?select=tdr-BttMxBSqRn3cMQ2yaA#tdr-BttMxBSqRn3cMQ2yaA\u000a\u000aCrispy Caramel Chicken, $16.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?select=pKbbf5klpX7hAg9_HY_rwA#pKbbf5klpX7hAg9_HY_rwA\u000a\u000aThe Sliders were ok, nothing special.  Same for the Crispy Caramel Chicken.  Neither one blew me away and made me want more.\u000a\u000aThe service here is always hit or miss.  They get really busy and the place is huge, so it's easy for you to get lost.  During this visit, I forgot to ask my server for Thousand Island Dressing for the Sliders....it took me a while to find him and flag him down because he was serving tables on the other side of the huge dining room, so it wasn't easy for him to glance over to our table to see us waving at him.  Finally, another server asked what we needed and she helped us out....oye!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

VDuring a recent Vegas trip, I was hungry for breakfast and decided to head over to the Grand Luxe Cafe at the Palazzo to grab a bite.  I was hungry for Waffles, so I knew what I wanted ahead of time.  However, after browsing the menu, I decided to add an order of Beignets as well.  When I think of Beignets, I think of the light, powdered sugar Doughnuts in New Orleans.  I was in for a big surprise when the server brought out the order....\u000a\u000aBeignets, $7.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?select=k3qwl979nu3K0smXiMGhNg#k3qwl979nu3K0smXiMGhNg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?select=SrtObgQ_8dSJKMBfZopbFA#SrtObgQ_8dSJKMBfZopbFA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?select=Xxth4L2hZfG1WhlCh8yVZw#Xxth4L2hZfG1WhlCh8yVZw\u000a\u000aBelgian Waffle, $8.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?select=aye9-4Y9ypMy4uSgu5_pFw#aye9-4Y9ypMy4uSgu5_pFw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?select=HxHvL4-uNZryft320GOUmQ#HxHvL4-uNZryft320GOUmQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?select=gIQX6_qfBQv6c7bA0OH6FA#gIQX6_qfBQv6c7bA0OH6FA\u000a\u000aCoffee, $3.95\u000a\u000aThe Beignets is actually a bowl of 10+ Doughnuts that are encrusted with Sugar....they're very good, but heavier and more rich than the type they serve at Cafe du Monde (New Orleans).  After having one of these, I decided to eat my Waffle first, so I could satisfy that urge.  The Waffle was very good.  After that, I was only able to eat 3 more Beignets before I had to cry uncle and give up....it was too much for me to handle by myself....LOL  They were tasty, just too large of a portion.  \u000a\u000aThe Coffee didn't help balance the sweet taste of my breakfast.  It wasn't worth $3.95....it was actually terrible and tasted like Folgers...yuck.  Save your money and buy Coffee elsewhere.\u000a\u000aOverall, the breakfast was pretty good.  I like it better than lunch and dinner menu items here.....so I'm raising it to 4 Stars from 3 for that.  Next time, I will bring my Wife or a guest to help with the Beignets.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 75% (breakfast only)

VFor my 1100th review, I'm going to use it on The Breakfast Joynt.\u000a\u000aGroupon has brought me and the family into this place over 8 times over the past year.  We've come in for Breakfast & Lunch.  More recently, Lunch, to avoid the long lines during the Breakfast hours.  Here's a tip, if you show up after 12 pm you'll be better off than before then to find a table.  This tip applies to Sundays, which is the day we prefer to go.\u000a\u000aHere are some of the items I've had here:\u000a\u000aThe Basic (2 Eggs, Bacon, Hash Browns, Buttermilk Pancakes) - $7.99\u000aBreakfast Burrito (Scrambled Eggs, Sausage, Onions, Green Peppers, Cheddar Cheese) - $6.99\u000aWestern Burger (Cheddar Cheese, Bacon, Onion Rings, and BBQ sauce) - $10.99\u000aSack of 10 Angus Sliders - $12.99\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5Ip4_yFvx3sz4qMqxl-4mw?select=mVXqbkwPFs19EnACRXJANA#mVXqbkwPFs19EnACRXJANA\u000a\u000aMy favorite is the Sack of 10 Sliders.  They're very good and you can take a few home for later!  The staff is friendly, but sometimes the food order can take a while. \u000a\u000aI hope they continue to do Groupon, because the deal is totally worth it here.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

I went along with him and browsed the bookstore.\u000a\u000aIt's been a while since I've been to this location and noticed that they offer FREE Wifi in their coffee shop area, which is a Seattle's Best.  hmm...looks like I found a new Study/Work location.  The store was very clean and the employees are always helpful.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I will be back soon to take advantage of the FREE WiFi.

It was an unbelievable experience playing on a course like this.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tpc-scottsdale-scottsdale?select=b8S5ixALJ8fig3eDLQKt5Q#b8S5ixALJ8fig3eDLQKt5Q\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tpc-scottsdale-scottsdale?select=ztolGdWKuqHmSFKIj6xPXA#ztolGdWKuqHmSFKIj6xPXA\u000a\u000aThe course was in perfect shape.  The rough will kill you though if you play anytime around the Open....that's because they get it in shape for the tour, so the level of difficulty is really high for us weekend hackers.\u000a\u000aOur caddie was awesome.  He explained a few of the historical aspects of the course, like Tiger Woods Rock from 1999's Phoenix Open.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tpc-scottsdale-scottsdale?select=k6CKLiApSShNU0WirXVwxQ#k6CKLiApSShNU0WirXVwxQ\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a pretty awesome golf experience.

However, the service was terrible despite being only 1 of 4 tables in the restaurant.\u000a\u000aAfter waiting 15 minutes to get seated (remember only 3 tables in the place occupied)...we were seated.  It took another 10 minutes to place our order.\u000a\u000aI ordered the LV Burger, which was a whopping $15.....yes, I realize we were at a resort restaurant.  I was hoping to experience the best Burger in my life, but alas I was disappointed.   I asked for it medium-well and it came out well-done.  What a disaster!\u000a\u000aOverall, it was an expensive & disappointing experience.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 1.1%

VAfter a night of gambling and drinking at Lone Butte Casino, this place hits the spot fo late night munchies.  It's your typical 24 hr casino coffee shop.

VIt's been years since I stayed at the Trop.  Since we planned a Vegas weekend to party at the new nightclub at the MGM, Hakkasan, we decided to stay here since I knew it would be more convenient to do so than to stay at the MGM....I'm glad I did that.  I was really impressed with what the new owners of the Trop have done here.\u000a\u000aLet's start with the rooms.  They remodeled the old Bungalows, which are the short 2 story buildings connected to the casino....they did a great job remodeling those rooms.  They are great with really comfortable beds and modern furniture.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-new-tropicana-las-vegas-las-vegas?select=n3eKKZh_PEfxOlBc48pptA#n3eKKZh_PEfxOlBc48pptA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-new-tropicana-las-vegas-las-vegas?select=LZVxL61Rz_45PqK0pjHf_Q#LZVxL61Rz_45PqK0pjHf_Q\u000a\u000aThe bathroom is a little small, but they did it right with a nice shower and sink situation that works well in the small space.\u000a\u000aThey offer FREE WiFi in the hotel rooms....huge +++.  And give you 2 complimentary bottles of Water.  Of course you're paying a $19.99 per night resort fee, so you better receive stuff like this....at least it stuff you can actually use.\u000a\u000aSince it's now affiliated with the Hilton Doubletree brand, you also get 2 fresh, warm Cookies with your stay.....Doubletree loyalists know what this is all about.  They're really good Cookies too.\u000a\u000aThe public areas were also remodeled.  The front desk and lobby area looks great.  A huge improvement over the old building.  The casino was also updated as well.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-new-tropicana-las-vegas-las-vegas?select=eIV20CNohs6mkUxUPeV9qA#eIV20CNohs6mkUxUPeV9qA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-new-tropicana-las-vegas-las-vegas?select=Bmv46jyG1mUfX-oITLx2WQ#Bmv46jyG1mUfX-oITLx2WQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-new-tropicana-las-vegas-las-vegas?select=j9rPqTz8wIeI-7zqlwfPag#j9rPqTz8wIeI-7zqlwfPag\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-new-tropicana-las-vegas-las-vegas?select=O2wKaJJ-KG36ffvjk5pLDA#O2wKaJJ-KG36ffvjk5pLDA\u000a\u000aCustomer service at this hotel has improved as well.  I had a question about the day/nightclub Bagatelle, so I called the guest service operator from my room.  I asked her if there was a cover charge for hotel guests to go to Bagatelle, she told me "Yes, there's a discounted cover charge for guests".....1 min later, she called me back to tell me that she was speaking to her supervisor after we hung up and that there was no cover charge on that particular day....wow, that was cool, I didn't expect her to call me back with updated info...that's good service to me.\u000a\u000aOverall, we had a great stay here at the Trop.  I highly recommend it as an alternative to staying at the MGM Grand.  Especially, if you plan to go to Hakkasan.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

VWas driving around the area and decided that I would stop by a place I've never been to before and found this little place in the same shopping mall as BWW.  It was around 2 pm and there were only two tables occupied in the joint.  A lady behind the counter asked if I was dining in or out.  When I told her I was dining in, she handed me a menu and told me I could sit anywhere in the restaurant.\u000a\u000aAfter browsing the menu for a few minutes, I decided on the Italian Sub (Ham, Capricole, Genoa Salami, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, and Provolone Cheese) $10.50....came with Fries, Cole Slaw, and Pickle.  I also ordered a side of Jalapenos, in case I wanted to add some kick to it.\u000a\u000aWhile I waited for my food, I looked around the joint.  There are beverage coolers in the front of the Deli that had Sodas & Bottled Water.  I was tempted to buy a bottle of Dr. Browns Natural Soda, but after reading the label I decided against it because it said "Sugar/High Fructose Corn Syrup".....how is that "natural"?  I'm trying to avoid HFCS, so I passed and got a bottle of Water.  They also have Bagels & Pastries available for purchase.....they looked tempting (see pics), but I wanted to wait until after I had my Sandwich to decide if I would do Dessert.\u000a\u000aAfter a few minutes my Sandwich came out.  The thing was piled high with Meat!  (see pics) I wasn't expecting this....I had to remove some of it before I ate the Sandwich, just so I could take a bite.  After a few bites, I realized that it was a pretty dry Sandwich.....so I asked for Mayo & Mustard.  I added a little of both and it still lacked something....so I took the Cole Slaw and put it in the Sandwich....ahh, much better!  The Sandwich by itself was too dry and lacked the flavor of really good Italian Sandwiches....at least to me.\u000a\u000aThe Fries were pre-fab Crinkle Fries.....pretty bland, had to add Salt.  They weren't that good.  The Cole Slaw very excellent, not too runny or sweet and had a nice crunch to it, which I like.  The Pickle was eh....I've had better.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a OK experience.  There are a bunch of other Sammies on the menu I want to try, so for now it gets 3 Stars from me.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I probably will, but I'm not craving the joint.

VI recently discovered Cici's Pizza over the Summer thanks to a friend of mine that lives near one in the Northwest part of Vegas.  Since then, I've visited 3 locations in the Valley.  This was the third one.\u000a\u000aMy Son and his friend wanted to get some Pizza before the UNLV Football game on Saturday.  Since this location was on the way to the Stadium, we stopped here for lunch.  AYCE Pizza Buffet priced at $3.99 per person is pretty good....don't you think?\u000a\u000aThis Cici's looks relatively new and is very clean.  It was a Saturday afternoon around 3 pm and it was packed!  However, it didn't stop them from pumping out Pizza after Pizza to keep everyone happy.  The boys and I went for plate after plate of Pizza.....until we couldn't eat another slice.  That held us over until we got to the Tailgate Party...ha!\u000a\u000aOverall, great spot.....service was awesome.  They kept the Pizza Buffet full of Pizza with over 100 people in the restaurant.....amazing!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  It's very far from my house, but next time I'm in the neighborhood....probably.

VWas on my way to a cookout and had to stop by here for some ammo.  This was my first visit to a Walmart Neighborhood Market and I was impressed.  It had all of the basics that you need.  Now, back to my shopping list:\u000a\u000a- Beer....check\u000a- Chips & Dip....check.\u000a- Pretzels.....check.\u000a- Gatorade.....check. (you gotta stay hydrated in Vegas)\u000a- Bag of Ice.....check.\u000a\u000aThey have Self Service Checkout stands, which I love and it was an easy process to checkout....despite having alcohol.  Sometimes it takes forever and a day for someone to come approve alcohol purchases via Self Checkout....not here!\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a pleasant and quick shopping experience.\u000a\u000aWill I return? Yes.

VI've been here many times, but only on Wednesday nights.  Why?  Because my coworkers love to come here for Ladies Night.  It's a fun night to people watch.\u000a\u000aTucked away in the City North development, the location is less than ideal to drive a lot of traffic.  So, it takes a lot of work to get people out here on a regular.  On Wed nights, they do a great job of doing that.\u000a\u000aThe place gets packed and you have to get there early or make reservations to snag one of the comfortable, padded chairs/table setups on the 2nd level with a great view of the band/dance floor.\u000a\u000aThe party atmosphere on Wednesdays is pretty cool, especially for Phoenix which is typically dead all of the time.  A mid-week party like this is rare.\u000a\u000aWe've dined here a few times.  The Margherita Flatbread and Burger are both pretty good.  The food isn't why we come here though, so it's always an afterthought for us.\u000a\u000aThe staff here is really attractive and can keep up with the pace of a nightclub atmosphere, so the service levels have always been high for us.\u000a\u000aOverall, a fun night out.  We'll definitely be back.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VMy wife and I enjoy coming to City Center and hanging out at Bar Moderno piano lounge for a few drinks.  Our friends were visiting from out of town and staying at Vdara.  So, when we got together for some cocktails we naturally picked Bar Moderno.\u000a\u000aGetting to City Center is pretty easy, but the parking is atrocious!  Valet parking is easy to find, but self parking is tough.  You have to keep your eyes open for the sign when you first enter the City Center driveway for the Self Parking on the left lane....if you don't, you'll miss it and end up in Valet.\u000a\u000aThen, once you get into the parking garage, you'll be frustrated because:\u000a\u000aa) You don't own a hybrid, you can't park in the spaces closest to the elevators.....WTF?  Seriously?  1/2 the spots are empty.\u000a\u000ab) There's too much space between cars, enough for another car.....but it's striped off because according to City Center they wanted "to give more room for people to get in and out of their cars".....that much room?  Seems silly when you can't find a parking space!\u000a\u000ac) If you have Verizon, the signal sucks in the parking garage and there are dead spots in the hotel.\u000a\u000aOnce you get into the hotel, you'll find navigating the property frustrating because signage is terrible.  We've been here 5 times, so we can navigate to most places fine, but our friends had difficulty finding the bar.\u000a\u000aI wrote a separate review for Bar Moderno, so I won't get into any details for that.\u000a\u000aWill I return to City Center?  Yes, but I won't give it any more than 3 Stars until they get some of their bugs fixed.

VVery impressive condo/hotel.  The rooms are spacious and elegant.  Would I buy one to live in or as an investment?  No.....\u000a\u000aWould I recommend friends to stay here in lieu of a regular hotel room....hell yeah!\u000a\u000aI've had several friends stay here and they found great deals on Hotels.com and other online travel booking sites.  The beds are nice, the kitchenette is convenient, and some of the views are spectacular.  The view of the Cosmopolitan/Bellagio/Planet Hollywood is the best view I've seen in the building.\u000a\u000aIt's next door to Aria, so there's no casino in the building....you have to walk to Aria for that action.  There's also a separate valet parking area to access the hotel.\u000a\u000aWe've had drinks in the lobby bar several times.....it's a laid back bar where you can meet colleagues for business or friends for casual conversation.  Good times.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VOur alumni club was invited by a rival university's alumni club to watch our schools play each other on a Saturday afternoon.  There were around 25-30 of us in the lounge and for $10 had Sandwiches and 1/2 off drinks during the game.  Not a bad deal!\u000a\u000aThere are 8 LCD TV Screens in the lounge and we had the audio for the game throughout the lounge.  We basically had the whole place to ourselves.  The seats were very comfortable....think Ultra-Lounge.\u000a\u000aThe only complaint was that there was one waitress for the entire group.....which meant very slow service.  Many people went to the bar to get their drinks.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a great time.....and we beat the other team by a lot!  I think they regretted inviting us to crash their party! ha!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet!

VPlanned to attend a conference in Scottsdale and found a great deal on Hotels.com for this hotel.  It was located relatively close to where the conference was being held, so I booked it.  Here's a breakdown of my experience at this hotel:\u000a\u000a- Hotel Room....the hotel had to have been built in the 70's or before because the design is very old.  My room had a small pseudo-kichenette area (coffee maker, sink, & small fridge).  The bed was very comfortable and the comforter was sooo soft.  It had a small TV and desk and a temperature controlled thermostat.   The bathroom was small and the lines in the bathroom weren't too soft.\u000a\u000aThe other note about the hotel rooms is that they are in separate buildings spread out all over the hotel property.  If you are staying here during the hot months, I recommend that you request a room that has a door that does not face East....why?  Because the doors are piping hot from the sun and when you try to open the door, your hand will get burned.  (see pics for outdoor shot)  I burned my hand a few times opening/closing the door.\u000a\u000a- Service....my interaction with the hotel staff was limited to the front desk only as I didn't use room service or any other service.  The front desk was very friendly and the check in process was quick and easy.\u000a\u000a- Keep in mind that they have a $10 per day Resort Fee, which includes a number of amenities....I posted a couple of pics of the details listing all of the amenities you get for the $10.  I only used the FREE Internet and 2 FREE Bottled Waters per day.\u000a\u000a- There are Tennis Courts that looked really nice, but I didn't play.\u000a\u000aThe property is in need of a renovation in my opinion, but for the value it's not bad.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I will consider it....depends on the rates around the area.\u000a\u000aComplete review

VI enjoy Sammy's.  My family & I eat at Sammy's often.  I was meeting a colleague here for lunch and have never been to this particular location.  I think it's one of the newer locations in town.\u000a\u000aThe service was pretty good, our server made sure our iced teas were kept full.\u000a\u000aSince it was a business lunch, I decided not to pig out and went for the Kobe Cheeseburger Sliders.  Normally, I would get a pizza and some appetizers, but I didn't have my wife, son, and mother to back me up and help me out with the chow....so, sliders it was.\u000a\u000aThey were cooked to my liking and I love how they are topped with Gorgonzola & Cheddar Cheese.....yum!  The only bad thing is that I really didn't want fries and I'm not a fan of Cole Slaw....but there was no substitutes, so I went with the fries....there went the diet!  I asked about a side salad and the server said the only size of side salad they had could feed 2 people!  What the hell?!  I hope they change that somewhere down the road because I can't pig out like that on business lunches.\u000a\u000aIn any case, the lunch was enjoyable.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet your Sammy's I will!

VI've been to Bar Louie a few times.  Most recently, my wife and I went to enjoy some appetizers and some wine.\u000a\u000aFood - Our last visit we ordered three appetizers.....Cheeseburger Sliders, Hummus Dip, and Goat Cheese Dip.  They were all delicious.  However, the Sliders were a little overcooked and the goat cheese didn't have as sharp of a flavor as we would hope.\u000a\u000aService - Our server, Nicolle, was very helpful and personable.  She ensured that our glasses stayed full and that we were taken care of.\u000a\u000aAtmosphere - This place is a bar/tavern.  There is a pool table & video games available.  There is also a nice sized patio, which i is where we ate tonight.....the weather was perfect.\u000a\u000aWill we come back?  Yes.

VDropped by this store to pick up some Yogurt, Veggies, and other random stuff.  It's a typical Fresh & Easy setup, which I like.  The employees are friendly....as a matter of fact, that's how I learned that we killed Osama Bin Laden....as I was checking out, the girl at the register said "Hey did you know we just killed Bin Laden?"......after I told her "no", she gave me the scoop.\u000a\u000aThey say you'll remember where you were and what you were doing when major world events happen......I'll always remember Fresh and Easy for that.

VBecause it's on the other side of the world from where I live, I've only been here a few times over the past year.  I wish it was closer to where I live because i love this place.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a- Amazing design.  I'm not an expert on architecture or design, but I love the way this place is designed.  The use of natural lighting, the decor, it's just fantastic.\u000a\u000a- Great food selection.  I've only eaten at 3 restaurants here, they are all very good.\u000a\u000a- The pool area.  They have concerts and events here that are a lot of fun.  I also like how you can dine and have drinks at restaurants and lounges overlooking the pool.  I've never had drinks at one of these spots during a concert, but would love to do that sometime.....I'm over the "be in the thick of things" and would prefer to watch a concert from afar.\u000a\u000aMy only complaint is the parking.  It's not intuitive for me.  The only parking area I've used is the surface lot on the right side of the building.....which is a freaking long walk to the casino.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I want to, but it will be a while before I make that drive.

VI hiked the Gateway Loop Trail, which is 4.6 miles total.  It was a Saturday and it was very busy.  The parking lot was packed, but we were able to easily find a parking spot.\u000a\u000aBefore you walk in to the trail head, you walk through a welcome center area of sorts.  There's a map of the trails in the preserve with a model to show you where to go.  It also tells you the difficulty levels of the trails so you know what to expect.  That was very cool.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mcdowell-sonoran-preserve-scottsdale?select=l-PThMUC157rOFrBSibtcw#l-PThMUC157rOFrBSibtcw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mcdowell-sonoran-preserve-scottsdale?select=11QU2z1pB4YGASeO_elaxA#11QU2z1pB4YGASeO_elaxA\u000a\u000aThere were a couple of volunteer guys greeting people and helping them figure out where to go.  If they weren't there, it would've been very confusing to find out where to go.  It's not intuitive.  Despite the models and maps, it's not clearly marked until you walk into the preserve for 1000 ft or so.\u000a\u000aOnce we got on the trail, it was pretty cool.  The Gateway Loop Trail has some nice views of the Valley.  Camelback and Mummy Mountains are easily seen.  On the North side of the trail, you can see the Troon and Pinnacle Peak areas.  \u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mcdowell-sonoran-preserve-scottsdale?select=FylmgvBeS_V7uRaXyxSqJA#FylmgvBeS_V7uRaXyxSqJA\u000a\u000aHowever, there wasn't much else to look at.  Except for a lizard, we didn't see any animals or wildlife.  We heard a few birds squawking to warn each other that people were nearby, but we didn't see them.  It gets kind of boring if you don't have anything to look at on a trail.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mcdowell-sonoran-preserve-scottsdale?select=VUkoLu93oFa1eB4dK8pyhA#VUkoLu93oFa1eB4dK8pyhA\u000a\u000aOverall, it was an OK hiking experience.  I am accustomed to more scenic hiking trails, so I was a bit bored after a while.  The number of mountain bikers on the trail annoyed me.....they're so dangerous for hikers, I don't like them.\u000a\u000aI'm planning to hike the Lost Dog Trail this week.  Let's see how that goes.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VI was starving and stopped by this shopping center looking for Slim's Sub Shop.  I was disappointed to see that Slim's closed.  I was on a time crunch and saw Rosati's.\u000a\u000aI ordered 2 slices of Cheese Pizza, and wanted a bottle of Water....the girl working the register told me they were out of bottled Water, Strike 1.  \u000a\u000aThe pizza came out after a few minutes.  The slices were huge!  It was almost the size of a small Pizza!  I thought that the Pizza was awful, the sauce tasted like canned sauce, the Cheese was flavorless, and I thought the crust was undercooked and rubbery, Strikes 2, 3, 4.  Since I was starving I ate it anyway, except I didn't eat the crust....which is rare for me, I always eat the crust....it was that bad.\u000a\u000aI know this place is a chain so I'm not sure I will ever try it again....not my type of place.  I prefer better quality pizza.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  No way!

VHad lunch there today with a friend.  I rarely get out to this side of the world.  M Resort is super far from my neighborhood.\u000a\u000aFood - I had the Nachos for lunch.  They were very tasty.  The chips tasted fresh, as if they were made in the kitchen.  The only problem with the dish is that they put too much of the toppings on it.  It was very soggy at the bottom of the dish.  The portion size is huge.  For an appetizer, it can feed at least 3 to 4 people.  For an entree, it's a lot to put down.....needless to say, I didn't finish it.\u000a\u000aService - The server was friendly and was quick on the draw for drinks....however, he was MIA during the lunch and took a while to bring the check.  The busperson refilled my friend's water, but oddly enough didn't offer to fill my Iced Tea.....I only had 1 glass.....rare for a 1.5 lunch.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a good experience.  We had a table overlooking the pool (see my pics).  The atmosphere for a Cafe in Vegas is the best, hands down.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Next time I'm in this part of Clark County, sure.

VWatched ASU play New Mexico in the 1st round of the playoffs this year.  What a great game and stadium!  The ASU fans were loud and proud and cheered their team to victory in the bottom of the 9th.....good times!\u000a\u000aThe game was at night and the weather was awesome.  The sun was setting around the 4th inning and it could not get any better than this!\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QgqCCYY5rjW03jcyrd-a6g?select=nNIDHEDlQAbMDvCXRtEvQQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QgqCCYY5rjW03jcyrd-a6g?select=JyXHemrJijoAtFbBOfObiA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QgqCCYY5rjW03jcyrd-a6g?select=Al1kfDtZr1BAxLznKwD69A\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QgqCCYY5rjW03jcyrd-a6g?select=H2Uwad0nAvCzse6ZG1WBYg\u000a\u000aTried some of the food at the stadium.....Hot Dog and a Bratwurst.  It was expensive of course, but the food was decent as far as stadium food goes.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a ton of fun.  Would like to see another game one day.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VThis was a classic experience where Less Is More could have been employed to make it better.  After passing by this joint many times, my Mom and I stopped by for lunch on Sunday.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Triple Cheese Burger (Swiss, Cheddar, Provolone) with a side of Thai Slaw.  Mom ordered the Blackened Chicken Sandwich (Cajun Chicken blackened in an iron skillet, topped with onions, peppers and melted jack cheese with a cajun mayo on a ciabatta roll) with a side of Thai Slaw.\u000a\u000aHere's the breakdown....the Burger has a lot of potential.  I like to put Cole Slaw on my Burger, so I put some of the Thai Slaw on it.  It was juicy, but there was simply too much Cheese on it.  I couldn't taste the Burger and the Cheese flavors were indistinguishable.  The Thai Slaw has some serious potential too, but it was way too runny.  After the first few bites of the Slaw, the bowl was full of liquid so the rest of the Slaw was 'soupy'.....too much sauce and very, very sweet.  Also, there was a ton of Peanuts in the Slaw.  I don't know if they meant to do that, but it overwhelmed the flavor....also, I expect a Thai Slaw to have some heat in it...their version doesn't.\u000a\u000aI had 1/2 of Mom's Blackened Chicken Sandwich....again, they should employ the Less Is More Rule here.  The Sandwich was topped with a bunch of Grilled Onions, then fresh Onions....it was Onion overload!  The Chicken had a good, char-smoked flavor, but was lacking a Spicy Kick that I would expect from a Cajun flavored Chicken.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a good experience....not great, but good.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I probably will to try other items on the menu.

VFlew into Vegas for the weekend and needed a rental car.  I reserved one via Expedia and Enterprise was the best deal, so I went with them.  I reserved a compact, which was supposed to be a Corolla or something like that....instead, they gave me a free upgrade to a Camry, awesome.  For that, they get 4 Stars.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 81%

VMy family loves Lindo Michoachan.  This location is the closest to our home, so we eat here often.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant gets very crowded during peak hours....here's a secret of ours....we like to come at 10 am on Sunday morning for an early lunch.  Why?  Because there is nobody there yet and you get seated right away.\u000a\u000aFood - during my most recent visit I had the Milanesa Torta.....it was the first time I've tried a Torta at Lindo and it did not disappoint.  The bread was perfect and the milanesa was cooked perfectly.\u000a\u000aWe also enjoy the fresh chips & salsa that also includes bean dip.  Most mexican restaurants don't give you beans with your chips & salsa, but they do!\u000a\u000aThe tortillas are made fresh daily....if you don't believe me, you can watch them make it.  They have an action station where a woman prepares fresh tortillas.\u000a\u000aService - The employee to customer ratio is very high so your water glass is never too empty and the chips & salsa will be replenished quickly.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Oh yeah!

VToday was Father's Day & my Mom's Birthday, so we decided to grab some lunch here.  Here's a tip.....if you want to come here on a holiday and you don't mind eating lunch early, stop by between 9:30-10:30 am.....it's open and there's no wait to get in.  If you come after 11 am, it will be jam packed.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Nachos & Mom ordered the Playa Combo....which is a Chile Relleno & Chicken Taco.  The food came out quickly and of course everything was fresh and delicious.\u000a\u000aI love how they have complimentary unlimited Chips & Salsa w/Beans.  The Salsa is spicy, just right and the Chips are homemade.\u000a\u000aThis place never disappoints!\u000a\u000aHappy Father's Day to all the Dad's out there!\u000a\u000aVoy a volver? Por supuesto!  (Will I return?  Of course!)

VBuffet of Buffets Marathon - Stop #3 of 7 12:00 PM\u000a\u000aThe 3rd stop in our single day tour of the Buffet of Buffets lead us to the Imperial Palace and the Emperor's Buffet.  Located on the 2nd floor above the casino, the buffet is the smallest in size and variety of the seven.  Our expectations were pretty low, so we weren't going to fool ourselves into expecting any pleasant surprises.\u000a\u000aAfter browsing the buffet line for a while, I decided to try out the Desserts.  Nothing on the main buffet line looked appealing to me and I wanted to save a little room for the other 4 remaining buffets.  The Desserts were OK.....the Cakes were very dry.  I'm glad I passed on most of the items here.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's the lowest rated buffet in the Buffet of Buffets.  Will it fill you up?  Sure.  Will you feel satisfied?  To each their own, in my case, no.  To end on a high note, the employees here are friendly.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 2%

VMade a huge mistake and went to the airport hungry.....damn.  Since I was stuck at the airport, I decided to try a new place.  My flight was out of gate B-12 and there is a 360 Gourmet Burrito joint that I've spotted here in the past....so I went for it.  There was no line and the menu is pretty large with a lot of options.\u000a\u000aThe lady working the register kept asking me for my order even after I told her I needed a few minutes to review the menu.  I decided on a Steak Burrito (Steak, Rice, Beans, Cheese, Lettuce, $6.99) and blurted it out......before I could say anything else, a guy handed me a Burrito....wow, that was fast!  I also ordered a bottle of Water ($2.99) and a bag of Jalapeno Chips ($1.99).\u000a\u000aThe Burrito was small....about 1/2 the size of a Chipotle or Q'doba Burrito.....and it is very Bland.  The Beans had no flavor.  Additionally, there's no Salsa on it.....and there is no Salsa Bar.  WTH?  I looked up at the menu and saw that Salsa is $.99 extra.  Dammit, nobody told me this.  Actually, for extra cash you could get Guacomole ($1.25), Sour Cream ($.99), or Salsa ($.99) in your Burrito...or bundle them all together for an additonal $2.99...what?!!  That would have made this tiny Burrito $9.98, no freakin' way!  Glad I didn't see that.\u000a\u000aAnyway, it was a complete waste of money and calories.  Save yourself and don't stop here if you're at McCarran Airport.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  No!

VThe last time I gave this place a try, the food sucked and I gave it 2 Stars.  On a recent Vegas trip my flight was at a gate nearby and I decided to give them another chance.  \u000a\u000aThis time around, the food still sucked, but the employees are even worse.  Here's what happened....I ordered the following items:\u000a\u000aBean, Rice, Cheese Burrito $6.99\u000aBottle of Diet Pepsi $3.19\u000a\u000aSince I had a backpack and other stuff in my hand, I forgot the bottle of Diet Pepsi at the counter after I paid for the meal.  I went to the counter to get settled in a spot to eat and get napkins, utensils, etc.  5 minutes later, they called my number for my Burrito....I was starving, so I started to eat it.  After a few bites, I noticed that I didn't have my soda....where was it?  I looked around, went back to the counter.....the employees looked at me but didn't say anything.  I walked around again looking for it....then I said to the girl cashier "I think I left my Soda somewhere, have you seen it?"  She said "No" then looked at one of the guys and said something in Spanish to him.  He said, "Oh, I think I have it.  I found it on the counter".  I watched as he reached into his backpack and gave it back to me.....WTF?!  I think they do this all the time, watch for people to leave stuff behind and then take it.  The appalling thing is that I was still in the restaurant!  \u000a\u000aI didn't say anything to them...it would've done no good anyway.  Once a thief, always a thief.\u000a\u000aThat does it for me, I will never eat here again.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 0%

VHeard about this place from the Vegas Talk board and decided to try it today for lunch.\u000a\u000aI ordered 1 Slice of Cheese, 1 Slice of Pepperoni, and 1 Slice of Sicilian Cheese.  All three came out hot and fresh.\u000a\u000aNY Style Cheese - This was the best of the 3 slices.  The crust was cooked perfectly and the Cheese & Sauce proportions were perfect.\u000a\u000aNY Style Pepperoni - I thought the Pepperoni was undercooked for my tastes....I like it slightly burnt.  It was very oily and was beginning to get soggy.  I wouldn't recommend for delivery.  Flavor was good, not great but good.\u000a\u000aSicilian Cheese - The crust was a little dry for my tastes.  The edges of the crust were very hard due to the overall dryness of the dough.  It was my least favorite out of the three.\u000a\u000aThe menu had other Italian dishes that looked interesting, the Pizzaghetti Sandwich looks very enticing.\u000a\u000aOverall, the Pizza was pretty good, but nowhere near as good as the competitor that was mentioned in the talk board.  This is where I wish there was a 1/2 Star rating system as I would give this place 3.5 Stars.  The NY Style Cheese was a 4 Star in my book, but the other 2 were 3 Stars.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  It's in Egypt from where I live, but I might make another trip to try the Pizzaghetti Sandwich.

VI visit this location to pick up some groceries and supplies for the house.  It has a good selection of products and the employees are friendly.  The only thing I don't like about it is that it's not open late.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 65%

V168 Market was 2nd on our shopping route this morning.....The Better Half (TBH) had a few things she wanted to get here.\u000a\u000aThis is our Asian "Go To" spot.  Since TBH does most of the shopping here, I wandered around.  I like to look at all of the exotic food and wonder what you do with it.  Today, I found a huge melon....Don Qua....these things are massive!  (see pics)  They're bigger than Watermelons....but they're very dirty....ie they have dirt on them still....what the heck do you do with it?  How do you prepare it?  How do you store this thing?  I don't know....but it was very interesting to me.\u000a\u000aI then browsed my favorite aisle....the aisle with the Hot Sauce.  Asians know what Hot Sauce means.....they don't mess around.  I bought a jar of the Garlic Hot Sauce and a small bottle of Sriracha.....I'm sweating just thinking about it.  Sooo cheap for huge bottles of Kick-Ass!\u000a\u000aTBH completed her shopping and at the checkout line we ran into a Thai friend of hers that told us they made fresh Soy Milk there....we were already checked out, so her friend gave us a small pint of Soy Milk to take home with us.  TBH tried it and said it was awesome!\u000a\u000aAnother successful day in 168.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Of course!

VCame here last night to meetup with a large group of people to watch the USC vs Hawaii game on the patio.  Our group made arrangements to have the patio to ourselves during the game.\u000a\u000aI've been here once before and didn't like it, but came here anyway because of the group get together.  The service all night long was atrocious.  Here's the breakdown:\u000a\u000aOur server gave my table a menu, but failed to mention that even though it wasn't Happy Hour, you could still order from the Happy Hour menu but pay full price for the items.  After browsing the menu for a minute, I thought I overheard someone at the table next to us order Nachos....I scoured the menu looking for them but didn't find it....so I assumed that I was hearing things and we proceeded to order a Pepperoni Pizza and a Mushroom Lover's Pizza.\u000a\u000aWhile we were waiting for our food, our glasses of Wine & Beer went empty....then our Water glasses went empty.  We had to flag down the waitress to fill them up each time.....this went on throughout the night.  They brought out the Pepperoni Pizza and we started to devour it....thinking the Mushroom Pizza was still being prepared, I didn't ask about it at the time.  Meanwhile, a huge plate of Nachos gets delivered to the table next to us....what the hell?!  \u000a\u000aThen another table next to us gets Nachos too!  So, I asked our server....."Where is Nachos on the menu?".....she says "It's on the Happy Hour menu, since it isn't Happy Hour they are $9, do you want to order one?"....I say "Well, if we didn't already order a Mushroom Pizza and Pepperoni Pizza, I would have ordered Nachos".....she says "What Mushroom Pizza?  All I have is a Pepperoni Pizza for you."......now I'm pissed....I told her to put in the order for Mushroom Pizza.  I asked how they knew about the Happy Hour menu and she said that they asked for it.....that's crazy....how are people suppose to know to ask about something they are unaware of?\u000a\u000aThe 2nd Pizza came out after a while, but what a disaster for service all night. \u000a\u000aThe Pizza was good...not great.  The Pepperoni didn't have enough flavor.  The Mushroom Pizza was far from a "Mushroom Lovers" Pizza....very few Mushrooms.  I expected more Mushrooms.  I would have rated the food 3 Stars.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Unfortunately, it looks like our group wants to meet here for games all year long, so if I want to hang out with them, I'll return.  Next time I'll eat before I arrive.

VAfter a really crappy visit to Cadillac Ranch a couple of weeks ago, I stopped by here to watch a college football game with some Alumni friends this past Saturday.  Because they chose this place, I didn't have a say in where to go....but decided to give it another shot.\u000a\u000aThe experience was a 180 degree change from the last one.  Even though it wasn't Happy Hour, the server had Happy Hour menus out.....which is great because the items on the HH menu are not on the regular menu....I don't care if I have to pay full price.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Jalapeno Poppers and based on the recommendation from the server, I had a Lagunitas IPA to wash it down.  The food came out pretty fast and was very tasty.  The Breading on the Jalapenos were very light....not the heavy stuff you find on most Poppers.  The Peppers varied from being really Spicy to Mild.....which happens often with Jalapenos.  The ones that were Spicy were REALLY Spicy!  But I like that...so +1 there.  I didn't care for the Cheese filling though...which was a Cheddar blend of some kind....I prefer Cream Cheese filling.\u000a\u000aThe Lagunitas IPA was very tasty....you could taste the Hops, but it didn't overwhelm the flavor.  It was a mellow IPA in my book.  The server made sure my glass was never empty during the game.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  While I don't prefer this place, it's the official spot to watch games for our Alumni Club, so I'll be back soon I'm sure.

VAnother one of those restaurants on my 'To Do List', I was in the area recently and stopped by to check it out.  I ordered:\u000a\u000aNachos (no meat, $6.50)\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OTcBXjDkViDPds4Lxy8KIQ?select=pyMpCBcJmA49t_wZ_fsfaA\u000aCheese Quesadilla ($3.95)\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OTcBXjDkViDPds4Lxy8KIQ?select=E5aH0xwP8-Ja4poLxosfDw\u000a\u000aThe Nachos wer pretty good.  The Chips were fresh and the ingredients tasted very good.  However, one minor problem with the Nachos is that the Beans are buried at the bottom of the dish!  Seriously, check it out:\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OTcBXjDkViDPds4Lxy8KIQ?select=t8a_2kWuGFXYzHbB7ZQdZQ\u000aYou have to eat through all of the layers of Chips, Green Chiles, Salsa, Guacamole, and Sour Cream to get to the Beans!  WTH?!  The Beans are really good too!  By the time I got to them, I was full and didn't have many Chips left to eat them with.  Bummer!  The highlight of the Nachos were the Green Chiles....they are really good and make these Nachos taste great and different from other restaurants.\u000a\u000aThe Quesadilla was awesome.  They put Green Chiles in the Quesadilla if you ask for it and believe me, you want them....they are sooo good!  It's what makes this Quesadilla unique and tasty.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a pretty good meal.  Not sure I would drive all the way across town to have it again, but if I am in the area I would consider making a short drive.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 79%

VThe Better Half and I had dinner here recently.  We were excited to give it a try.  We ordered:\u000a\u000aFried Ravioli, $8\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5TXQxcwEfqzBDbMq2zmBPQ?select=Cb5qWTxGOT-CTNHRd_Cuow\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5TXQxcwEfqzBDbMq2zmBPQ?select=8SLMGwC5pH0GiMsjM-pT9w\u000a\u000aSalad, $3\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5TXQxcwEfqzBDbMq2zmBPQ?select=jhtp-tVJy5UzPsx55WUs2Q\u000a\u000aOnion Soup, $3\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5TXQxcwEfqzBDbMq2zmBPQ?select=5Dyslao6BSIQ0VxV1_Z9pQ\u000a\u000aRigatoni Al Forno (Italian Sausage, Mushrooms, Peppers, Red Onions, $16)\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5TXQxcwEfqzBDbMq2zmBPQ?select=US3FGoiG1caGrHhaFRgZTw\u000a\u000aFilet, $24\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5TXQxcwEfqzBDbMq2zmBPQ?select=ajrFcMCfbTBkt_A-qPCoHQ\u000a\u000aSide of Spaghetti, $3\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5TXQxcwEfqzBDbMq2zmBPQ?select=Q7bhq4rZOvCuZuvQdHrcPw\u000a\u000aCheesecake, $4\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5TXQxcwEfqzBDbMq2zmBPQ?select=u4L7008Zsgwss-u8uvih9w\u000a\u000aThe Fried Ravioli was just OK.  It was very oily and was a little bland.  Not what I expected from this dish....looked a little undercooked or the fryer's temperature was too low.\u000a\u000aThe Salad and Onion Soup was pretty good.  Onion Soup was full of flavor.\u000a\u000aI had the Filet and thought it was a little tough....the flavor was good, but the Filet was not tender like I'm use to.  The Better Half had the Rigatoni and gave me a little to sample.  It was just OK too....the Sausage tasted more like a Kielbasa rather than an Italian Sausage....not what I expected.  The side of Spaghetti was decent, but again nothing spectacular.\u000a\u000aThe Cheesecake was very good....nice and fluffy.\u000a\u000aThe service was a little spotty.  Our server disappeared for long stretches....which was odd because there were only 3 tables in the entire restaurant with people dining.....what he was doing was beyond me.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was an average experience.  Not what we were expecting from a joint like this.  Maybe we caught them on a bad day?\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 40%

VMy family loves Chef Marc.  He had a restaurant on Tenaya & W Lake Mead Blvd that closed a couple of years ago.  We didn't realize he opened a place on Buffalo & Washington....as soon as I heard that he did, I took the Better Half to dinner here.\u000a\u000aWe were pleasantly surprised to be greeted by Chef Marc himself at the door.  The place was packed and he offered to have us dine at the sofas in the middle of the restaurant.....we politely declined as we prefer a regular table.  We told him we'd prefer to have a glass of wine while we waited for our table.....we're patient.  My Wife told him that we came here to have his Portobello Mushroom & Organic Spinach appetizer (one of our favorites from the old joint)....he said he'd check to see if he could make it.\u000a\u000aWhile we waited, we had a glass of Sangiovese wine....it was pretty good....don't remember any other piece of info as it was suggested by Chef Marc and we ordered based on his recommendation.\u000a\u000aAfter a 10 minute wait, we were seated....not too bad for not having reservations.  While I perused the menu, I noticed that the Portobello Mushroom appetizer wasn't on there....I wondered if we would get it.  I ordered a Bufalo Mozzarella Caprese Salad to start with Sweet Potato Gnocchi w/Gorgonzola Cream Sauce for an entree.....the Better Half ordered the Escargot Appetizer for her meal counting on the Portobello Mushroom Appetizer to show up.\u000a\u000aWe were pleasantly surprised to see the Portobello Mushroom Appetizer show up.....it was one of our favorite dishes from his old joint and here it was!  It was just as good as we remembered!  The sauce was rich and creamy and the Organic Spinach was fresh and went well with the entire dish.  A few minutes later the Bufalo Caprese Salad arrived....it was a large portion that could have easily been split between 2 people.  The Mozzarella & Tomatoes were fresh and it was A-1 Grade Goodness!\u000a\u000aFor a second glass of wine we ordered a glass of Zinfandel...don't remember the vintage or vineyard.\u000a\u000aThe entrees showed up and I was eager to try the Gnocchi.....it didn't disappoint!  The sweet flavor of the Sweet Potato went perfectly with the Gorgonzola Cream Sauce....I was in Heaven!  Wifey enjoyed her Escargot.....we couldn't believe it was only $9!\u000a\u000aOverall, we had an awesome time.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Hells Ya!

VThe pizza isn't the greatest in the world, but it will do....especially when it's all you can eat for $7!  My friend lives around the corner, so he recommended coming here for lunch.\u000a\u000aI didn't know what to expect, but was happy to find a really clean place.  The restaurant was about 1/2 full during lunchtime on a Tuesday.  On the buffet line you will find at least 12 to 15 different pizzas.  Since I love Pizza and can eat it morning, noon, and night I was in heaven.  I was about to screw up all of my efforts from the morning workout.\u000a\u000aHere's a list of what I can remember eating...the slices are small, so it's not as much as it appears...although it was a lot!\u000a\u000aPepperoni - Regular Crust\u000aPepperoni - Thick Crust\u000aPepperoni - Thin Crust\u000aPepperoni & Jalapenos\u000aMacaroni & Cheese - Yes, it's a pizza!  It was just ok though.\u000aHam & Cheese\u000aVeggie Thin Crust\u000aMushroom & Pepperoni\u000aPepperoni & Sausage\u000a\u000aThere were many others that I didn't try.....BBQ Chicken, Hawaiian, and several I can't remember.  Overall, it was great value for the money.\u000a\u000aThe people who work here are very friendly too.  They greeted everyone who entered the door & everyone who left.....and it sounded sincere not fake.\u000a\u000aThere was a small selection of video games & other games in the back room and tv's.\u000a\u000aWill I come back?  When I want to gain 500 lbs....yes!

VI've played this course a few times.  The course has three 9 hole courses that you combine to make an 18 hole round.  I've played all three configurations, but the most recent one was the Desert/Mountain combination....the longest of the three.  Here's a breakdown of the three courses and my Pros/Cons list:\u000a\u000aDesert\u000aSilver - 3,560 yds\u000aBlack - 3,278 yds\u000aBlue - 2,987 yds\u000aRed - 2,616 yds\u000a\u000aMountain\u000aSilver - 3,599 yds\u000aBlack - 3,274 yds\u000aBlue - 2,999 yds\u000aRed - 2,666 yds\u000a\u000aValley\u000aSilver - 3,398 yds\u000aBlack - 3,102 yds\u000aBlue - 2,862 yds\u000aRed - 2,575 yds\u000a\u000aPROS\u000a- Course is kept in decent shape most of the year.\u000a\u000a- Relatively low cost.  Green fees aren't too bad.\u000a\u000a- Great for beginners and mid to high level handicap golfers.\u000a\u000aCONS\u000a- There aren't very many signature holes....they're pretty boring to me.\u000a\u000a- Far from the Strip.  This is a non-factor for me, except when friends from out of town want to golf....they ask about this course and I tell them to forget it, unless they want to pay a huge cab fare.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I have a friend who lives nearby and it's his favorite track...so probably.

VThis is one of the most beautiful hotels I've seen.  Well appointed and full of rich history, this place is truly a 5 Star property!  I was here to meet a client for a business meeting & lunch.  If you're visiting during the hot Summer months, I recommend valet parking as it is a pretty long walk from the self parking lot to the entrance of the hotel.\u000a\u000aThe property is sprawled out over a large amount of acres....a classical designed hotel.  They don't make places like this anymore.\u000a\u000aThe service here is outstanding as well.  Everyone from Valet to the food servers understand what it means to provide excellent "customer service".  I will definitely be back soon.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VI've been here many times for special events in the ballroom.  The property is beautiful and the banquet staff always delivers great service.  There are 3 places to park, but if you're coming here for an event in the ballroom, I suggest parking at the parking garage on the left side of the main entrance.  It's located right next to the ballroom area and is very convenient.\u000a\u000aThe ballrooms and meeting rooms here are gorgeous and have plenty of space to hold a luncheon, reception, or charity event.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VOver the past few years we've been to this property dozens of times for charity events and galas.  There are a handful of hotels that host a majority of these events and this is one of them.\u000a\u000aOne of the main reasons is because they offer high quality service in their banquet facilities.  They also have a separate building that houses a large ballroom and on some occasions they have valet service at that building, which makes it easy to get in/out.\u000a\u000aWhenever we get invited to an event here, we look forward to it.  If you're looking for a nice place to stage an event, I recommend that you take a look at this place.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VI love Jean Georges!  This is one of our favorite Steakhouses in Vegas.  It's chic, the service is outstanding, and the food is awesome.  When we lived in Vegas, we dined here several times with friends, clients, and associates.  Since we moved away, we've dined here a couple of times and it's still one of the best.  On our most recent visit, we ordered:\u000a\u000aShrimp Cocktail, $24\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jean-georges-steakhouse-las-vegas?select=SB9fjtPMZe1uSfIkrWDAsw#SB9fjtPMZe1uSfIkrWDAsw\u000a\u000aWedge Salad, $18\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jean-georges-steakhouse-las-vegas?select=ParoKhwPVYkS75fYHbs0_A#ParoKhwPVYkS75fYHbs0_A\u000a\u000a8 oz Filet, $56\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jean-georges-steakhouse-las-vegas?select=wyuSSo6SyEj_E0lkMaIvYA#wyuSSo6SyEj_E0lkMaIvYA\u000a\u000aRack of Lamb, $54\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jean-georges-steakhouse-las-vegas?select=y3z9DxKeC2ym8wMsTgao4g#y3z9DxKeC2ym8wMsTgao4g\u000a\u000aBlack Truffle Mac n Cheese, $18\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jean-georges-steakhouse-las-vegas?select=arVyfuaH2n5we4Ny-HF4vQ#arVyfuaH2n5we4Ny-HF4vQ\u000a\u000aThe Wedge Salad was a perfectly sized portion and full of flavor.  The Iceberg Lettuce was crisp and juicy....the thick slices of Bacon added a ton of flavor to it....yum!\u000a\u000aThe Better Half enjoyed the Shrimp Cocktail.  She almost got full off the Jumbo Shrimp.\u000a\u000aI had the Filet, which was heavenly.  Juicy, charred just right, and full of flavor.  It comes with a choice of sauce and I always get the JG Steak Sauce.  The sauce compliments the Steak and doesn't overwhelm the natural flavor of the Beef.\u000a\u000aThe Black Truffle Mac n Cheese is spectacular as well.  Very rich and creamy.\u000a\u000aThe prices at this joint are not for the budget-minded diner.  Don't fool yourself....if you don't want to spend the money, don't dine here...you'll be disappointed.  However, if you want a great meal in a chic restaurant with awesome service, then this place is for you.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

I love Town Square and Johnny McGuire's is a great sandwich shop in the heart of the shopping center.\u000a\u000aI normally get the Johnny, but this time I wanted to try the Bearcat sandwich.....which has Turkey, Bacon, Peppers, Cole Slaw, 1000 Island Dressing, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions.  It was very tasty, but also very messy.  The dressing and slaw were falling out of the sandwich....but it was good!\u000a\u000aAlso had a bag of the homemade chips....those are the best when their hot and fresh.\u000a\u000aWill I come back?

VFound this joint using the Yelp App.  It was 11 am on a Thu and was getting hungry.  I lucked out and found a parking spot right in front of the joint.  The place has the vibe and is decorated in a 50's Diner motif.  Music played from the time period and there's a soda like bar in the center of the restaurant.  The server gave me the menu and after a few minutes I decided to get:\u000a\u000aTexas BBQ Burger (Cheddar Cheese, BBQ Ranch Sauce, Onion Rings, Bacon) - $6.15\u000a http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw?select=8vow_cM6bCgIO0HWGbCizw\u000aHot Dog (Nathan's Hot Dog, Onions, Relish, Mustard) - $4.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw?select=aJkenAKKYIXTrSK1Of9b0Q\u000a\u000aThe food came out pretty fast.  I was pleased to see 2 large pieces of real Bacon sticking out the side of the Burger....yum!  \u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw?select=82Ua27nge5lTTx9N7g2rAg\u000aI went for that first.  The Onion Rings in the Burger were nice and crispy and had good flavor.  The BBQ Sauce was slightly tangy and went well with the other ingredients....and of course there's the Bacon.....perfectly cooked, not too burnt not too undercooked, just right!  All together it was an awesome Burger.\u000a\u000aNext up was the Hot Dog.  The Dog comes split in half (I like it that way).\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw?select=uPb_Py9o7hP_7UCBsIqc-Q\u000aCooked just right, the Hot Dog had a nice slight 'snap' to it.  The Onions and Relish were fresh and went together well with all the fixins.\u000a\u000aFries came with both orders.....there was too much, so I didn't finish them....but they were very good.  The server was very friendly and was always checking on me.  It was a great dining experience.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VLocated at the Scottsdale Quarter, this is the most convenient Apple Store for me.  I have many Apple products and enjoy coming in to test drive before I buy.  \u000a\u000aThe first time I've ever used the Genius Bar was at this location....but I had a subpar experience with it.  My iPhone was having issues with it's power bar status and the kid at the Genius Bar told me to backup my iPhone and reset it but don't add back all my apps....basically, start over and add back the apps 1 by 1....seriously?!  Who's going to do that?  Well, I didn't and waited for the next IOS update, guess what...?  Yep, it fixed the issue.....ridiculous.\u000a\u000aI guess I will only come here to buy products and I'll figure out any issues on my own.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VLocated right in front of Hakkasan in the MGM Grand, this is the perfect place to meet up with people for a pre-party drink.  That's exactly what we did before going into Hakkasan.  There was a large group of us and we needed a centralized place to get organized so that we could get into the nightclub easily instead of everyone getting in at one time.  \u000a\u000aWe arrived early and had a few cocktails before the rest of the group showed up.  Once everyone arrived, we went in to Hakkasan.  Drink prices are a little higher here than the other bars at the MGM....probably because of the location.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VOk, let me tee this up.  I was in the area with my Wife and she wanted to check out the antique shops nearby.  Well, I wanted to watch the football games.  So, while she shopped, I popped in here for a Beer & some food.\u000a\u000aI tried the Abondigas Soup and Chips & Salsa.  Both were ok.\u000a\u000aThere aren't too many TV's in the restaurant, so I got luck that there were only  few tables and I was able to find one with a good view of one of the TV's.\u000a\u000aThe staff was super friendly and attentive.  They were probably wondering what I was doing since I spent 4+ hrs in there watching football while Wifey was shopping.  LOL\u000a\u000aWould like to come back for dinner sometime.  The rest of the menu looked pretty tempting.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VWas looking around Yelp for lunch today and saw @Jennifer R's review.....after reading it and the other review of this place, I had to try it out.  I wanted to beat the lunch rush so I could get a table, so I got there around 11:30.....perfect timing.  I was the only non-Mexican patron in the restaurant (out of 12 people).\u000a\u000aThere are four 4 Top tables and one 2 Top table in the restaurant.  I snagged a 4 Top right in front of the counter and ordered a Carne Asada Burrito & a Carne Asada Taco.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a Jarritos Orange Soda in the cooler....of course I had to get one......sweetened with natural sugar & not HFCS, it's one of my fav's.\u000a\u000aWhile I was waiting for my food, I went to the Salsa bar and prepared some Red (Hot), Green (Mild), and Pico de Gallo Salsa.  It's a small Salsa bar, but what it lacks in quantity it makes up in quality.  Then I no\u000aticed in the cooler an odd bottle that said "Sangria" on it.....What the Frijoles? (see pics)  So, I went to investigate.....turns out it's "non-alcoholic".....dammit, fools gold!  Who would drink that???  blech!\u000a\u000aWithin a few minutes my food was ready.  I went for the Taco first.....devoured it in 3 bites.....it was amazing!  The Carne Asada is marinaded with the same flavor I remember back in So Cal.....I think I found Taco Nirvana!  Then I went for the Burrito.....it's a nice size for $3.99, great value.  The Burrito didn't disappoint either!  It was amazing!  A quick note for the Gringos....if you order the Burrito with "Everything", it will already have Hot (Red) Salsa inside the Burrito....and it's pretty spicy, so if you're sensitive to that, tell them without salsa.  The Burrito had Carne Asada, Beans, Rice, Salsa, and Onions in it.....good proportions of all ingredients too.  Just like the Taco, the Asada's flavor was just right.\u000a\u000aOverall, this place has just launched itself to the top of my Taco Shop list.  Thanks @Jennifer R for that review!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Orale, of course!

We were really disappointed.\u000a\u000aThe selection of food was not very good.  The best items was the Ice Cream and desserts....which were average at best.\u000a\u000aIt was one of those meals where you got mad at yourself for wasting calories on bland food.  Oh well.\u000a\u000aOne good thing is that the cashier at the buffet told us we'd get a discount for signing up for a players club card.  We did and got a good discount, unfortunately the food wasn't worthwhile.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 5%

VAttended the Coffee Crisp UYE here hosted by Jennifer C & Elle C.  I brought my Son along to enjoy the grub and Yelp fun.\u000a\u000aWe were first to arrive and since it was packed, we ordered before everyone.  We ordered:\u000a\u000a2 Double Doubles Animal Style ($3.05)\u000a1 Cheeseburger Animal Style ($2.05)\u000a2 French Fries Animal Style ($3.25)\u000a\u000aWe brought our own bottled Water.\u000a\u000aAfter a 15 minute wait, our food was ready.....it was already 1 pm and we didn't see any other Yelpers, so we started to eat our food.  The Double Double Animal Style was juicy & sloppy....just how I like it!  (see pics)  There's something about the spongy, toasted Bread, gooey Cheese, fresh Tomato & Lettuce, Special Sauce, and Grilled Onions that makes me want to never stop eating this stuff.  The Animal Style Fries were fantastic as well.\u000a\u000aAbout 1/2 way through our meal, I spotted Paolo D & Jennifer C at the door waiting for everyone.  I went over to introduce myself and let them know that we had room at our table and that we'd also keep an eye out for nearby tables to open up so we could all sit together.  We were eventually able to get everyone together.  We all enjoyed a nice meal plus we shared in some Coffee Crisps & Caramilk Bars for dessert courtesy of Elle C from Calgary! (see pics)\u000a\u000aWhat a great day & meal.  Great Food & Great People = Good Times\u000a\u000aWill I return?  This location is very far away from where I live, but if there's another UYE here, I will try my best to make it.

VI've been here twice with my family.  Both times we've never left disappointed.  They cook the pizza exactly how we like it.....Well Done.  If you don't like well done pizza, then you shouldn't come here.\u000a\u000aOur favorite dishes are the Paul & Young Ron Pizza (Meatballs, Sausage, Hot Pepper, and Ricotta Cheese)....we also like to make our own.  For an appetizer we split the Fresh Mozzarella & Tomato Salad....which comes with marinated sweet peppers...we add a little oil/vinegar and it makes for a nice appetizer.\u000a\u000aService - We've never had any issues with service in the 2 times we've visited the place.  Service was always prompt and courteous.\u000a\u000aWill we return?  Absolutely!

VI shop at this grocery store at least twice a week since it's on my way home from the gym.  Unlike other reviewers, I haven't had any issues at all with elderly people or how the store manages elderly people.\u000a\u000aMy experience has been mostly good.  There are the occasional hiccups, but there's no such thing as a perfect store.  I like the deli meats and cheese selections at this store.\u000a\u000aMost of the items I shop for are conveniently located near the entrance, which allows me to get in/out quickly.\u000a\u000aThey offer several self-checkout registers, which is very convenient as well.\u000a\u000aA few downsides are the age of the store....it's old by Vegas standards....and the size.  I wish the store was a bit larger so that I could have more items to choose from.\u000a\u000aOther than that, the fresh meat/dairy/vegetables/bread quality is always very good, so I give this place 4 stars.  It's much better than the Albertson's that's around the corner from my house.

VA colleague and I dropped in for lunch.  Located inside the Hyatt Gainey Ranch Hotel, this bistro is kind of a cool spot for business lunches.  After browsing the menu, I asked the server for her recommendations.  She mentioned the Tortilla Soup and the Chicken Sandwich...I decided to order both!\u000a\u000aChicken Tortilla Soup, $7\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/swb-southwest-bistro-scottsdale?select=ierF1dcLqbHnkuSYQVBfEQ#ierF1dcLqbHnkuSYQVBfEQ\u000a\u000aChicken Sandwich, $13.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/swb-southwest-bistro-scottsdale?select=jP3kNNLapF2saR16v6cu4g#jP3kNNLapF2saR16v6cu4g\u000a\u000aThe Tortilla Soup came out first.  I ordered a small size since they didn't have cups and it was a nice sized portion.  It's not as thick as I normally like my Tortilla Soup, but what it lacked in texture, it made up in flavor...this is a good soup!\u000a\u000aA short time later, the Chicken Sandwich came out.  This portion size is not too large, it's actually perfect for lunch.  I took one bite out of it and instantly became a fan.  The Bread is a sourdough sandwich roll and went perfectly with the grilled flavor of the Chicken.  The Fries were seasoned with Sea Salt...that makes a huge difference.  I prefer Sea Salt seasoned Fries over regular salted Fries.\u000a\u000aOur server and the rest of the staff was very friendly.  The resort atmosphere was very relaxing.  It's a great spot for lunch if you're in the area.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

VLove this location.....there is a small group of friends who meet for lunch at this location a few times a year.  We enjoy it because it's close the Strip, where most of the group works.  We also like how it's less busy than the Summerlin Location....at least during lunch hour mid-week.\u000a\u000aDuring my most recent visit, I had a 1/3 Burger with Cheese and Fries & Drink ($9.99).  It takes a few minutes for your Burger to be prepared, but it's worth the wait and not nearly as long as Fatburger.  The Burger was made to my specifications (medium).  I loaded it with Jalapenos, Onions, and melted Jalapeno Cheese....yum!\u000a\u000aThe employees are always friendly and greet everyone as they walk up to place an order.  Overall, a solid place to grab a quick bite to eat.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

VStopped here to grab a bite before my return flight to Vegas.  After browsing the menu for a minute, I decided on the Chicken Philly Sandwich w/Fries and a Blue Moon.  \u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/B1jlDEUrVyPgR4vOMnaiKQ?select=q-ml8IWsnNgvx1CeL1SKGw\u000a\u000aThe Sandwich came out in a decent amount of time....If I was in a hurry to catch a flight, I would have made it, but I was in no hurry, so I was able to enjoy my food without rushing.  The Chicken had a nice flavor to it, but it was a bit dry for my tastes.  The proportion of Peppers/Onions/Mushrooms/Cheese was appropriate and the flavors complimented each other well.\u000a\u000aThe Fries were excellent.  Cooked just right, they weren't soggy  but slightly crispy, which is how I like it.\u000a\u000aOverall, it wasn't a bad meal for an Airport joint.  It is a 3.5 Star place rounded down.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 65%

VI've never tried a McRib Sandwich and I heard via the Talk Threads that McDonald's in Las Vegas started serving them the other day, so I took my Son here to give this legendary Sandwich a try.\u000a\u000aWe ordered two McRib Meals (Sandwich, Fries, Soda) $4.19.  I also wanted to try the $1 Spicy McChicken Sandwich.\u000a\u000aThe verdict......I didn't like the McRib at all...blech!  The Sauce was the best part about it. Other than that, it was pretty bland.  The Fries were good of course....and the Spicy McChicken Sandwich was decent, not bad for $1.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a complete waste of calories.  I'm not dinging McDonald's for my stupid curiosity, so they get 3 Stars.  The McDonald's experience was A-OK. \u000a\u000aDid I find value in my meal?  Not today....my fault though.\u000aWill I return?  I'd come back again to order something I enjoy.

VI knew better than to stop by here, but I was hungry and I no longer resist the temptation to try some of those "fresh made" Breaded Chicken Tenders.  I ordered a 3 Piece Chicken Tender, Bean Burrito, and Western Bacon Cheeseburger.  \u000a\u000aIt took a while for the food to come out....I guess they really do make them by hand.  The first item I had was the Western Bacon Cheeseburger.....once upon a time, this was my favorite Burger.  Now, it's just awful.  The Bacon doesn't even taste like Bacon.....it's that paper-thin, pre-cooked, microwave Bacon, blech!  And the Onion Rings inside the Burger were very poor quality....I took one bite and the entire Onion came out of the Ring because it was so tough.\u000a\u000aNext up was the Bean Burrito....it was just ok.  I'd rather have a Bean Burrito from Taco Bell or Del Taco.  Don't know why I ordered it.\u000a\u000aLast up was the Hand Breaded Chicken Tenders.....I saved them for last because if they were fresh, they'd be piping hot and I don't want to burn my mouth.  I bit into the first piece and yuck!!!  It was rubbery.....just awful.  I didn't finish the rest of them.....what a waste of time, money, and calories. Damn.\u000a\u000aThey get 2 Stars instead of 1 Star because the employees were very nice and friendly and the place was clean.  You can have your Happy Star!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 0.001%

VMy wife and I decided to check out this lounge as we've heard so much about it.  We were very disappointed with the entire Mandarin Oriental experience.  We've heard so much about their 5 Star service that we had our hopes up.\u000a\u000aWe walked from Aria to Mandarin Oriental.  You have to walk down a long set of stairs to get to the entrance.  On the way down, we noticed how filthy the stairs were.  I realize it is windy, but 5 Star properties shouldn't have trash on stairs like that.  There was a lot of trash too.\u000a\u000aOur next disappointment was that there was no doorman to open the door for you.  I don't want to sound like a snob, but I thought that was a requirement for a 5 Star property.  Well, there were none.\u000a\u000aThen the two employees in the lobby didn't greet us.  They ignored us while we looked around for the elevators.  We had to approach one of them to ask how to get to the lounge.  He was busy texting someone on his cell phone....hmm....5 Star service?\u000a\u000aWhen we arrived at the lounge, we were very impressed by the decor.  Again, it shocked us because there were 2 employees behind this huge desk and not one of them greeted us.  We were well dressed and looked proper, so I don't know what the deal was.  Anyway, we were finally seated in the lounge and our waitress spilled the water when she filled my wife's glass, but didn't clean up the spill on the table.....what?  and she poured across the table instead of next to us....wow, that's 3 Star service 101 and they can't get it right here?\u000a\u000aThe wine selection was very good and the Cabernet I ordered was fantastic.  The views from the lounge are spectacular.  That's the only reason why this place got 2 Stars....I was very tempted to give it 1, but the ambience, decor, and quality of the wine gave it the extra Star.\u000a\u000aNormally this kind of stuff doesn't bother me, but we wanted a 5 Star experience....we could have spent much less money somewhere else and received better service.  Maybe they had an off day....I dunno.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Because of the brand name, I will give this place another chance.

VWhat a great place to watch a football game.  Located in the basement level of the Palazzo, this is an awesome spot.  The main dining room is sunk in and has a ton of TV's to watch the game.  The dining room also has sofas for you to sit and coffee tables to place your food and drink....it's like hanging out at home with 100's of people.  Plus, there's are race & sports book terminals in the room so you can place bets on the game!\u000a\u000aMy friends and I decided we would order whatever we felt like eating and share amongst the group.  I was able to sample these menu items:\u000a \u000aWings, $15\u000aSausage & Pepperoni Pizza, $17\u000aOnion Rings, $7\u000a\u000aThe Wings were excellent.  Very tasty and full of flavor.  They were cooked just right, the Meat fell off the bone and wasn't "rubbery".  The Pizza was fantastic as well.  The Onion Rings are huge and is a belly buster, so be careful if you order those...you'll need a wheel barrel to get you out of there....ha!  Of course I washed it down with plenty of Beer.\u000a\u000aIf you want to get a prime spot in the main dining room, I recommend that you make reservations or get there early.  We lucked out and got a prime spot in the center of the main room.  However, people arriving late had to wait in a ridiculously long line or settle for one of the tables or bar top seats on the sides, which are not prime spots.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VI'm a huge fan of Fresh & Easy.  This location is a good one.  I visited it for the 1st time the other day since I was in the area.  They are very consistent and have the same great products as the others.\u000a\u000aThis one earns 5 Stars from me because it also has easy parking.  The other 2 that I've been to have very small parking lots and can get congested during busy hours.  This one is in a strip mall and has a ton of parking.  Of course a 5 Star is not earned on parking alone......they have the Il Fornaio Bread and discounted items that I love so much.  If a Fresh & Easy doesn't earn 5 Stars from me, they've got issues.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I'm sure I will.

VIf you smoke Cigs or Cigars, this is your spot for cheap smokes.  You don't have to pay tax on it, so it's much cheaper.  I don't smoke Cigarettes, but I smoke Cigars on occasion.  I stop by this place to grab a stick or two before a round of golf with the buds.  If you're on the run, there's a drive thru available for your convenience....I've never used it though.  I like to "feel" and personally select my Cigars before I buy.\u000a\u000aThere's a Chevron gas station here too, so you can grab some gas as well.  The gas station can get busy during the lunch hour and right after work.  Lanes are not very wide, so it's difficult to maneuver when it gets busy.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VStopped by on the way to the airport with Mom to have lunch.  I've had this place on my "To Do" list for a while.....it was time to give it a try.  The decor is very nice and modern and I like how they are connected to a full service bar and separated by glass.....so the smokers in the bar won't bother the diners.  We were given menus and seated.  We were told that the menu doubles as an order sheet.....in other words, it's a custom Burger joint where you select each item for your Burger.....cool.\u000a\u000aAfter browsing the menu for a few minutes, I decided to go with:\u000a\u000aJuicy Lucy Burger w/Regular Bun, BBQ Sauce, Jalapenos, Marinated Onions, American Cheese, Cheddar Cheese $9.50\u000a+Bacon $1.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag?select=r_g9twzpNXEvAjfXwIG20Q\u000a\u000aTall and Thin Fries - $4\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag?select=8hrzsZ1yfIxHC-3pxww4bA\u000a\u000aMom went with a Turkey Burger w/Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions, and Jalapenos, $8.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag?select=OvID1zfcEgO1ZvMXtMhygg\u000a\u000aThe Juicy Lucy is two Burger patties cooked together with the Cheese in the middle between the patties.  I've seen Burgers like this on the Food Network and was anxious to give this a try.\u000a\u000aAfter a few minutes our food was ready and I bit into the Juicy Lucy.....the Cheese oozed out of the center of the Burger.....you have to be really careful because it's HOT!\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag?select=-IseHtIgiZZxOT1A8n4KpA\u000aThe Burger was good, but not great....I thought the toppings and Bun were the highlight of the Burger....the Meat was OK, but wasn't great.....I don't know, it was missing "something".  The BBQ Sauce was excellent and added some much needed flavor to the Burger.  I liked the Marinated Onions....would like to know how they are prepared.\u000a\u000aThe Fries were very good and it's enough to serve 2 people.\u000a\u000aMom enjoyed her Turkey Burger, but said she's not sure it was worth $8.  I would agree with her....for the price of our Burgers, I was hoping they would be mind-blowing.....they were good, but not great.  I will probably come back and give it another shot.....maybe I picked the wrong combo of toppings.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 75%

VWe found this place via Living Social last year.  Since it's located inside the Ice Den, an ice skating rink, there's no way we'd stumble across this place.  It's a pretty cool place to grab a bite to eat, drink, and watch sports.  There's plenty of TV's and the booths have small, private TV's that you can control the channel selection....perfect for watching a game!\u000a\u000aEvery time we come here, I get the Appetizer Platter (Onion Rings, Chicken Fingers, Potato Skins, Quesadillas), $12.50.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=vrTkMnVL__fBIoCQuV537g#vrTkMnVL__fBIoCQuV537g\u000a\u000aIt's a large portion of food, so plan on sharing if you order it.  The platter is delish for bar food.\u000a\u000aThey have drink specials and happy hour too, good stuff.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VEveryone knows I'm a Pizza addict....I can't resist it.  So, when I saw that there was an AYCE Pizza buffet nearby, I decided to pop in for lunch.\u000a\u000aPriced at $6.49, it looked promising.  Unfortunately, it wasn't.  The restaurant looks like a cheap copy of CiCi's Pizza.  Not that CiCi's is quality Pizza, but it's heads and shoulders above.  I gave this place a good try though and pile up my plates high:\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ALouXcCfsrnbpNEpO9-Y3A?select=eV7eTP8eZq9WvH1TaZR6UA\u000a\u000aThe Pizza itself was about 3 Stars, but overall I gave the place 2 Stars because the selection of Pizza was pretty weak.  In the 30 minutes or so we were there for lunch, we didn't see very many options for Pizza.  At other Pizza buffets they pump out a variety of Pizza so you have a lot of choices.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ALouXcCfsrnbpNEpO9-Y3A?select=qwYd_fU11hT-GT1gicfv0Q\u000a\u000aThey also have the option for other comfort foods like Fried Chicken, Biscuit's & Gravy, Beans, Mashed Potatoes:\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ALouXcCfsrnbpNEpO9-Y3A?select=M31XSvdMuVLEiZidKrxvSQ\u000a\u000aI tried the Fried Chicken and it was just average.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ALouXcCfsrnbpNEpO9-Y3A?select=1SUIvPzca7H3-nsESuutAg\u000a\u000aOverall, not a stellar experience.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 10%

VAfter reading many reviews of this place, I decided to stop by here for lunch and try it for myself.  I was please to see how nice the decor of the restaurant was.  There are two dining room areas and bar seating.  The owner, Leticia, greeted me and asked me if I wanted a table or sit at the bar.  Since i was eating alone, I saddled up to the bar and ordered from the Bartender.  \u000a\u000aI decided on the Nachos and a Raspberry Iced Tea to wash it down.  While I was waiting for my order a server brought out complimentary Chips, Beans, and Salsa.  In Vegas, it's rare to get Beans with the comp Chips/Salsa....also, there were two Salsas.....a Chipotle based Salsa and an Avocado/Cilantro based Salsa.....it was excellent!\u000a\u000aA few minutes later my Nachos came out.  They were covered in Cheese and had two small portions of Sour Cream & Guacamole on top...certainly not enough for the entire dish.  The Nachos has a lot of potential....the Chips were fresh, all of the ingredients tasted very good....but the proportions were all messed up.  Too much Cheese, not enough Sour Cream/Guacamole/Pico de Gallo.....just the right amount of Beans & Jalapenos.  The Cheese was melted just right, but with some bites it overwhelmed the dish.  A lot of potential here...\u000a\u000aOverall, I enjoyed the meal and loved the friendly service and active owner who cares about her restaurant.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I want to come back with my family and try a few more dishes.

VI love Sandwiches.....so I decided to stop by this joint for lunch recently.  After browsing the menu for a minute, I decided I was going to order the New Yorker (Pastrami, Cole Slaw, Thousand Island Dressing, on Marbled Rye) w/Fries & Pickle for $8.99.  \u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mKybTX2TTB_f_q9gj0s85Q?select=wYhry_TSaeyE3jlM3kqRTg\u000aTo wash it down, I ordered a large drink for $2.29.\u000a\u000aWhen you walk in, you get into a line like a cafeteria.  Then you place your order with someone who prepares you meal for you and then pay the cashier.  \u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mKybTX2TTB_f_q9gj0s85Q?select=5tUWH1ZbuhFAMnR5sYaztA\u000aIt's an efficient process and it allows you to see other people's orders just in case you want to change your mind.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mKybTX2TTB_f_q9gj0s85Q?select=XQa5ffhPOJPUWHb_ULqogQ\u000a\u000aI couldn't wait to take a bite out of my Sandwich.  The Cole Slaw comes inside the Sandwich, which I love.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mKybTX2TTB_f_q9gj0s85Q?select=Son0jYmuPk8BM11ZBga8dA\u000aThe only downside to this is that it makes the Sandwich very soggy fast as the Slaw will soak the Bread.  But that's OK with me.  I took one bite and thought the Sandwich was OK.  The flavor was pretty good, but I don't know, it wasn't great......didn't leave me wanting more.  The Fries were pretty good, but again just OK.  The Pickle was very good and was complimentary....very cool.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a good meal.  There are other Sandwiches on the menu that I want to try.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 65%

VAnother one of my favorite golf courses here in Vegas.....this one is tucked between the Suncoast & Rampart Casinos in Summerlin.  It is the sister course to the private TPC course in Summerlin where the PGA event is held.\u000a\u000aThis course can be challenging for high handicap players and beginners.  However, for everyone else the immaculate and fast greens are a lot of fun.  I played in a tournament, scramble play, and had the round of our lives....we couldn't miss....bad thing was that another group had the game of their life and beat us by 1 stroke!  Dammit!  Besides tournament play, I've played this course numerous times on regular days....I like how it's not very crowded on weekdays.\u000a\u000aThe scenery is your typical Vegas desert course, but the rolling hills and well maintained course doesn't make you feel high and dry.\u000a\u000aThe clubhouse is very nice and the food is excellent!  The starter is friendly and is always full of useful information.  Not too many courses have starters like that anymore.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I can guarantee that I will!

VLocated inside the Biltmore, this place is an awesome restaurant to meet clients or friends for lunch.  I ordered a Margherita Pizza and some Iced Tea.  The Margarita Pizza was superb!  Very good and just the right size too....not too large & not too small.  I left satisfied.  The Iced Tea was very good too....I think I drank 5 or 6 glasses!\u000a\u000aOf course, the service was outstanding as well.  It's no wonder why there were several tables and booths with people conducting business....it's a great place for that.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 96%

VMy Son's iPod Touch volume buttons broke so we took it to get repaired by the Guru Crew.  I found them via Yelp Talk and opted to get it repaired rather than purchasing a new one.\u000a\u000aThey were able to diagnose the issue as a bad cable.  That was the good news.....the bad news was that the only supplier for the cable was in China and that it would take 3 to 4 weeks to get it delivered.\u000a\u000aWe patiently waited one month for the cable and the repair.  All in, it only cost us $55.  That's a lot cheaper than purchasing a new iPod Touch.  The guys there were great and kept us informed of what was going on.\u000a\u000aI hear they fix Video Games too.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I'm considering brining my old school Xbox units in to get repaired.  Of course I will, they did a great job!

The Edamame was very good, The Potstickers were delish.  The Meatloaf Sliders was the one that I was most interested in, but it came up short.  The Meatloaf was a little bland, lacked a full flavor that I was expecting.  The Garlic Parmesan Fries were very good and full of flavor.  The best item though was the Firecracker Chicken w/Broccoli....nice Spicy flavor and the Sauce that the Chicken was cooked in complimented the dish well.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a decent experience.

VAfter browsing the selection of draft Beer, I was pleasantly surprised to see some quality....I started out with a Dogfish Head IPA ($7) and ordered a 10" Pepperoni Sausage & Jalapeno Pizza ($11.95).  The Pizza came out and to my surprise was very good!  The crust was soft and doughy and tasted great....the Pepperoni and Sausage were good quality.  I normally like Jalapeno on my Pizza, but for some reason I didn't like it this evening and regretted ordering it as it took away from all of the goodness of the rest of the Pizza.  I ended up picking them off the slices.\u000a\u000aI watched the Lakers lose to the Bulls....that called for an Abita Purple Haze ($7), which I couldn't believe they carried!  It's brewed out of Louisiana and is hard to find in bars in Las Vegas....bonus!\u000a\u000aLater I tried a Duvel ($7), which is a Belgian Beer....very good too.  I'm amazed at the selection of Beer here.\u000a\u000aAfter a few hours of fun and games, we left.  Kiddo had a blast with his buddies and discovered a cool place I enjoy on the Strip!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I'm trying to think of an excuse to go back....ha!

VI can't believe I'm going to type this, but......getting a new drivers license was pleasant....yes, I said it....it was pleasant.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a+ The total process from start to finish on a Friday morning took 25 minutes.\u000a\u000a+ Everyone was friendly.\u000a\u000a+ Forms were short and easy to fill out.\u000a\u000a+ The process flow was fluid and logical.\u000a\u000aMost of my experience with a joint like this are frustrating...not here.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%....at some point I have to come back, right? :)

VThis place has been on my bucket list for a very long time.  I love Fry Bread and someone recommended this place, but because it's all the way in Mesa, it's taken me a while to finally try it out.  A few colleagues and I came here for lunch and ordered a Cheese Crisp and an Ultimate (Red Sauce, Beans, Cheese, Lettuce, Tomatoes).\u000a\u000aThe Cheese Crisp was huge!  It was about 30% larger than a normal Cheese Crisp.  We almost got full on that alone.  \u000a\u000aThey make the Fry Bread fresh to order here, so it took a while to get ours.  I couldn't wait to bit into it....when I did, it didn't disappoint.  It was awesome!  So much flavor and very filling.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VI came down here to attend the Strong Beer Festival.  This was my first visit to this joint....and I was really impressed with it.\u000a\u000aI am impressed by the staff here.  The bartenders & waitresses were very friendly and knowledgable about all of the beers they had on tap.  I was told by a regular that the owner of the bar (who happened to be working behind the bar helping out) is a beer connoisseur who will frequently bring in awesome craft beer for everyone to enjoy for short periods of time.  The regulars also told me he's really cool and loves to hangout with the guests.  This is the kind of bar I love....too bad it's 10,000 miles away from my house.....not quite that far, but it's too far to make it a regular hangout.\u000a\u000aI also like how there are 3 pool tables in the bar with 2 in a separate room and 1 near the main bar.  Usually you find them crammed together in one location and people get in each other's way.  Not here...you can shoot pool near the bar or if you prefer to hang with just pool players, go into the other room.\u000a\u000aThe beer for the Strong Beer Festival was awesome too....here's a rundown of what I can remember drinking:\u000a\u000aBallast Point\u000aSculpin IPA - 3 of them...one of my favorites from the night.\u000a\u000aDogfish Head Craft\u000aOld School Barleywine (15% abv) - this was very sweet...didn't really like it.\u000aFort  (18% abv) - this was even sweeter than the Barleywine....and got me hammered.\u000aSah'tea - This was my favorite  of the 3 from Dogfish\u000a\u000aRogue Brewery\u000aXS Imperial IPA - really enjoyed this, but very bitter.\u000a\u000aFirestone IPA - Another solid one...I've had it before.\u000a\u000aDeschutes Brewery\u000aHop Henge IPA - Very good, one of my favs of the night\u000aJubel 2010 - This is another solid beer.....the bartender Tony suggested I try it....I had 2 or 3 of these, can't remember.\u000a\u000aTenaya Creek\u000aHop Ride IPA - yummy....I tasted this at the Beerfest @ the Art District.....had a lot of it that day, so I only had one Fri night.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Next time I'm on this side of town or next Strong Beer Festival!

VCame here for the Winter Beer Fest on a Saturday afternoon.  As usual, tasting glasses were $15 for the 1st round (you keep the glass) and each round after that is $4.  Not bad!  The lineup of Beer was pretty good, but not as good as the Summer Beer Fest in my opinion.  We arrived at 12:30 pm and here's a list of Beer I had:\u000a\u000aStone Double Dry Hopped IPA\u000aStone Smoked Porter w/Chipotle Peppers\u000aBallast Point Brewing Company Dorado Double IPA\u000aStone Imperial Russian Stout Bourbon Barrel\u000aStone Smoked Porter w/Vanilla Beans\u000aBallast Point Brewing Company Sculpin IPA\u000aBig Dog's Sled Dog Stout\u000aBig Dog's War Dog Imperial IPA\u000aMoylans Brewery Kilt Lifter\u000aJoseph James Barrel Aged Desert Dawn\u000a\u000aThey were all very good.  My favorites were the Stone Smoked Porter w/Chipotle Peppers.....I should have ordered this with a Burger.  Instead, I ordered a 16" Margherita Pizza ($13).  The Pizza was awful.....0 Stars.  I'm a Pizza lover too and I'm very tolerable about bad Pizza....but this one was soooo bad.  The crust was tough like cardboard and the ingredients were subpar.  You're not suppose to use regular Tomatoes on a Margherita Pizza....but that's what they did and they were bland.  Blech.  Ken M ordered Fish Tacos and he loved them.....I think I ordered the wrong menu item.  Oh well, next time I'll try a Burger.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a good time.....I wish this place was closer to my neighborhood.  Return Factor - 99.9%

VAfter living here for 15 years, I finally went to my first NFR event.  Since I'm not a Cowboy, my expectations were very low.  I was pleasantly surprised to experience such an awesome event.  It is 10 days of non-stop action and partying!\u000a\u000aEvery event is action packed.....with my two favorites being the Bronc Riding and Bull Riding.\u000a\u000aThe key to really enjoying the rodeo is to get there early and spend some time outside the Thomas & Mack enjoying the food stands and beer tent.  You can find Philly Steak Sandwiches, Burritos, Italian Sausage & Pepper Sandwiches, Fries, Hot Dogs, Burgers, BBQ, and Pizza....and much more.  The food is better outside the arena than inside, which is your typical arena type food.\u000a\u000aThe beer is reasonably priced and your limited to your basic domestic beers.  If you want craft beers, head inside the Thomas & Mack and they have a few vendors that serve better stuff.  That's the only positive to the food choices inside.\u000a\u000aAnother tip is to make sure you dress warm.  It's the middle of December and it can get chilly outside.  Oh, and don't forget your Cowboy Hat!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Hell ya!

VHad dinner here with a good friend.  Have always passed this by on prior visits to Aria and never gave it a 2nd thought.  When he suggested Tapas for dinner, I was excited to give this joint a try.\u000a\u000aThe menu isn't as extensive as other Tapas restaurants, but the quality is exceptional.  We ordered:\u000a\u000a- Brava Potatoes (Spicy Tomato, Alioli Sauce, $8)\u000a- Creamy Risotto (Wild Mushroom, Manchego Cheese, Natural Jus, $10)\u000a- Pan Tomate (Toasted Bread, Fresh Garlic, Tomato Sauce, $6)\u000a- Spanish Tortilla (Potatoes, Eggs, Onions, $8)\u000a- Stuffed Piquillo Peppers (Goat Cheese, Mushrooms, $10)\u000a- Stuffed Dates (Almond, Applewood Bacon, Spicy Piquillo Pepper Sauce, $8)\u000a- Buuelos (Spanish Doughnuts, Butterscotch, Caramel, $8)\u000a\u000aThe Brava Potatoes were OK.  They had good flavor, but were very filling.  I don't recommend having this if you want to try more than a couple of items....this is a gut-buster.\u000a\u000aThe Creamy Risotto was awesome!  I finished it off in no time.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=lMySncNeWzMMnVjutvUdYw\u000a\u000aThe Pan Tomate was pretty good....an excellent start for the meal.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=GGXY6sUnEQD0-tlpUFHM_w\u000a\u000aThe Stuffed Piquillo Peppers were my favorite...yum!  They cooked just right and the sweet and savory flavor of the Peppers went perfectly with the Goat Cheese and Mushrooms.  I could eat a large plate of those, easily.\u000a\u000aMy friend had the Stuffed Dates and the Spanish Tortilla.  He enjoyed both of them.\u000a\u000aThe other highlight of my evening was the Buuelos.....damn, these were good!  The Caramel Butterscotch dipping sauce went perfectly with the Spanish Doughnuts.  I love how they have the toothpicks for easy dipping/eating.  They are addicting too because I can't get my mind off of them.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=6365pbJb9_eE-Hj_kxdMtw\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a great meal and good times.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VWas in the area for today and my business partner and I decided to have lunch here.  It has been a very long time since I've eaten at Chili's.\u000a\u000aFood - Since I was undecided on what to get, I chose the Triple Dipper, which allowed me to sample 3 appetizers.  I chose the Burger Bites, Honey-Chipotle Chicken, and the Boneless Wings.  The food was good, not great, but good.  I also had the Blackberry Iced Tea, which was good too....you don't need to sweeten it.\u000a\u000aService - The service was very good.  We were seated fast and the people there were friendly.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Sure, the price was right and the food was good.

VWas in the area today and had lunch with a colleague here.  I ordered the 12 Piece Chicken Nachos.\u000a\u000aThey were very good.  I thought the proportion of all of the toppings on each chip was perfect.  The portion was good, I wasn't too full and not left hungry.  The Salsa was too weak for my tastes and the Jalapenos weren't spicy at all.  If I could change two things it would be to offer a spicier Salsa option and offer a spicier Jalapeno option.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Sure.

VThis place has so much potential to be really awesome.  We enjoy coming here for the food and drink, but not so much for the shopping.  Here's a breakdown of this outdoor mall:\u000a\u000a+ Dominick's Steakhouse is housed here.  One of the best Steakhouses in Scottsdale.\u000a\u000a+ Apple Store, Tanzy, Brio, Sol Cantina...some of the places we enjoy at this mall.\u000a\u000a+ It's outdoor and walking around is pleasant.\u000a\u000a+ Convenient parking.  There are 2 large parking garages on opposite sides of the mall as well as a few valet options.  The street-side parking is often hard to find though, so it's not worth driving around looking for a space in my opinion.\u000a\u000a+ They have misters throughout the entire place to cool you off during the hot Summer months.\u000a\u000aMy only complaints are that it is relatively small and that businesses go under quickly (see Narcisse, Prime Bar).\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a pretty cool place to hang out at.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

VI've had this place on my radar screen for a very long time.  I finally decided to give it a try when I was in the area recently.  The name is kind of misleading.....I was expecting a sit-down restaurant with table service, what I found was a Coffee Shop (a la Starbucks), except it's locally owned.  I was a little disappointed because I had built up a huge appetite and the menu was very limited.\u000a\u000aAfter a few minutes I decided to get their Cheese Pannini.  When I arrived, there was only 1 person in front of me, so I thought the service was going to be fast.....it wasn't.  It took almost 15 minutes to make my Paninni.....which for a sit-down restaurant wouldn't be bad, but for an order at the counter type place, it's kind of a long time.  I arrived just before the lunch rush (11:30 am)....while I was waiting, it got very busy with 10 people in line or so.  They are single threaded here with their food preparation, so I can't imagine how long they will have to wait for their food.\u000a\u000aAnyway, when my food came out, it looked great.  I couldn't wait to take a bite of the Paninni.  It was as good as it looked, very good!\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA?select=iM-bmUJgFX3I3lpLT57uTQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA?select=E2YbzDiWAomUXZQu3VtjSw\u000aThe Tomato Sauce in the Paninni was great and full of flavor.  The Bread was very tasty too.  The Paninni came with a very small side of greens which also went well with the dish.  I wish there were more greens.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a good experience.  However, for those with large appetites, I wouldn't suggest it....the portions are too small and ordering two Paninnis wouldn't be cost effective.  The joint is situated between a bunch of office buildings and is suited more for that crowd than a casual diner.  The staff is very nice here and makes a sincere attempt and getting to know their guests.  They asked me what my name was and where I was from, where I heard about the place, etc.....and they knew several of the people who stopped by for lunch by their 1st name....I'm guessing by the way they were dressed that they worked in one of the buildings nearby.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 30%

VBack before Vegas grew into it's current size, the first thing you would see driving into town was the Welcome to Las Vegas Sign.  The sign has become an icon of the city and has greeted millions of people over the years.\u000a\u000aSince the city has grown far beyond the sign, you'd think it would become minimized.....not!  It's still a major tourist attraction.  So much so, that it requires it's own parking area in the median separating the North and South lanes of Las Vegas Blvd.\u000a\u000aI remember coming to Vegas from So Cal as a kid and waiting in anticipation to see the sign.....it was a sign that we were entering into what felt like another world....because it was.\u000a\u000aI love sharing this with my friends who visit from out of town....especially the ones who fly in and otherwise wouldn't get to see this monument to Sin City.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VMy wife and I enjoy Aria and one of our favorite places to hang out is Bar Moderno.  This bar is adjacent to the casino and features a piano player in the evenings.  We enjoy it because you can hang out and have a conversation while people watching, which is one of our favorite things to do.\u000a\u000aWe planned to have a few drinks here then head over to Mandarin Oriental to hang out in their sky lounge.  The drinks here are about average for Vegas high end properties.  This particular evening we enjoyed a glass of Malbec.  We enjoy red wine and their Malbec is reasonable priced at $13 per glass.\u000a\u000aThe service was ok.  The waitress was very attentive to our needs, but once we closed the check, she ignored us.  That was too bad because we changed our mind and were going to order another round, but since she never came back we left and went to Mandarin Oriental.  I don't understand people sometimes.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Yes, because we like Aria and it's one of the few lounges in town we really enjoy.

VMet some friends for cocktails last night.  Another solid night at Bar Moderno.  The piano player is great and the volume of the music is just right for conversation.  Our servers were very attentive and ensured that our glasses were always full.\u000a\u000aThe wine by the glass selection has been expanded a little since our 1st visit and there are some reasonably priced wines available for those who don't have deep pockets.\u000a\u000aThe furniture is comfortable and we love the people watching when you sit by the rail.  Saw Juliette Lewis walk by.....she looked good, but her hair looked ratty....must be getting ready to film Natural Born Killers part II or something.\u000a\u000aSolid night out.....bumped it up 1 Star because the service was 10x better this time than last.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Absolutely!

The Enchilada is covered in Mole Sauce, which offers a smooth, chocolatey taste to compliment the Steak.  Amazing.\u000a\u000aKiddo and The Wife had the Chicken Mole Poblano and the Barbacoa Taquitos.  They loved their dishes and finished their plate.\u000a\u000aDessert was the Capirotada and the Trio de Helados Fritos.  All I can say is yum!

We went with the House Cab ($9).....it's not too bad.\u000a\u000aOf course there are video poker and slot machines on the bar for those who like to gamble.  I no longer gamble, so I didn't play any games.\u000a\u000aOne of the other great things about this bar is it's great for people watching.

I was at a client meeting in Downtown Phoenix and since the meeting went over the lunch hour, they asked if we wanted to grab something to eat and someone mentioned Pita Jungle....awesome.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Falafel Pita.  It was pretty good.  The Falafel was cooked just right with a hard outer shell and moist and tasty center.  The Pita and Veggies were good too.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a very satisfying meal and we were able to power through our meeting.  I want to come back and try different menu items.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VRented a car from Expedia from this Thrifty location.  I found a decent deal for $30 a day for a compact car.....I thought I was getting a score.....then, I went to get the car.  Lo and behold, what did they give me?  A freakin' mini-van!  Umm....yeah, I didn't order a mini-van!  But they said that was the only car they had left in that price range but for an extra $20 per day I could upgrade to a Ford something or other.  Well, I wasn't going to roll around in a mini-van, so I paid for the upgrade......classic Bait & Switch!\u000a\u000aI was so mad, but had to make the best of a bad situation.  I calmed down and went on my way.  Never again will I rent from Thrifty.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 0%

VWas bar hopping with a friend and dropped by this joint.  It was a Thursday night around 11 pm.  The place was dead.  There were only 30 or 40 people.  The design of the joint was pretty plain and uninspiring.  The DJ was pretty good and was the highlight of the visit.  We stayed a half hour or so because of him....but eventually got bored, so we left.\u000a\u000aWill have to come back on the weekend to check it out.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 74%

VWhen I'm in the mood for a Smoothie, this is my 'go to' place.  It's in my neighborhood, so it's very convenient for me to get here.  My favorite Smooties are the Rockin' Raspberry (Raspberries, Strawberries, and Banana) or Paradise Point (Strawberries, Banana, and Pineapple).  I'll add a shot of protein in there for good measure, especially after a workout.\u000a\u000aThe employees here are always friendly.  The only problem I have with the service is that it can take a while if it's very busy.  In those cases, I won't wait and just come back another time.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Of course.

VOne of the many cities in the Valley of the Sun, I enjoy my visits to this city.  It's spread out over a large area of the Valley.  We have friends that live in the far south end of the city and some that live near the 10 fwy close to Tempe/Phoenix.\u000a\u000aThere's a nice selection of restaurants and shopping throughout Chandler.  The city also has an awesome automall area with BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Lexus to name a few all located in the same area so you can easily shop for cars.\u000a\u000aThe rent is relatively cheap in this city as well.  We've seriously considered moving here, but the commute is just too long.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 75%

VI love watching the AZ Rattlers.  We've become big fans since moving to Phoenix.  The games are super exciting and you can get real close to the action.  Plus in 2011 they went to the Arena Bowl and lost at the last second....did that stop them?  No, they went back to the Arena Bowl and won!  They're the reigning AFL Champions and are doing well again this year.\u000a\u000aWe always look forward to attending a game and the tickets are relatively cheap.  They're always running deals for local residents on tickets.  Our Son and his friends love to come an watch a game and we'll get tickets 5 to 10 rows from the field so they feel like they're part of the action.\u000a\u000aThe players interact with the fans and if the ball flies into the stand during the game, you can keep the ball just like baseball!  It's pretty cool.  We have a collection of balls that we've caught from all of the games we've attended.\u000a\u000aThe quality of football is pretty good too.  Both teams score a lot of points and there's always action on the field.  We're big fans of the Rattlers!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VOk, so I got suckered into checking this place out one day because of their Buy 1 get 2 FREE TV commercial.  After hearing it 100x on TV, it finally got to me and I had to check it out.\u000a\u000aThere's a large selection of suits.  They're made from a variety of places around the world....Mexico, India, Southeast Asia....and the quality ranges form OK to poor.\u000a\u000aThe OK quality suits were severely overpriced at $1100....yes, that's right, $1100.  Ok, so that means the Buy 1 get 2 free really means 3 suits for $1100....that's if you're on the ok end of the quality scale.  The poor quality suits are priced around $400....so that's $133 per suit on the low end of the scale.  Well, forget that.....I can get better suits elsewhere.\u000a\u000aI just couldn't get myself to pay that kind of money.  I'd rather have 1 very nicely tailored Italian suit for $1100 than some ok tailored suit from some other country.  Well, they got me in the store, but couldn't close the deal.  \u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 1%

VWhy did resist coming here for so long...?  I can tell you why...because for a golfer like me, it's pure heaven and an empty wallet waiting to happen!  All I can say is that this place is a golfer's dream.  There's nothing in here but golf....and it's the size of a Sports Authority or a Dick's Sporting Goods...it's massive!\u000a\u000aAisle after aisle of clubs, clothing, accessories, shoes, balls, putters, and on and on...\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pga-tour-superstore-scottsdale-2?select=OgJHm9Klx82cfTrQkBsNEA#OgJHm9Klx82cfTrQkBsNEA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pga-tour-superstore-scottsdale-2?select=6VHjTeUXR6mW8A7ArvK-Fw#6VHjTeUXR6mW8A7ArvK-Fw\u000a\u000aBesides that, there's an entire wall of hitting bays where you can try out clubs or get fitted for clubs that you want to buy.  Each bay has one of those video screens to track your shot trajectory, distance, etc.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pga-tour-superstore-scottsdale-2?select=mVUTrcnkqep8TYMWVQ_h3A#mVUTrcnkqep8TYMWVQ_h3A\u000a\u000aIn the back are a handful of instructional hitting bays where you can get lessons.\u000a\u000aWell, I was there to find a driver and it didn't disappoint.  I was able to find a Taylor Made RBZ 9.5 driver for $169.  I tried it out in the hitting bay first and it felt good, so I bought it.\u000a\u000aThe store, products, and services offered get a solid 5 Stars.  However, the customer service there was a bit spotty....the cashier and guy at the grips area were very nice and helpful....solid.  \u000a\u000aHowever, the guys working at the clubs section were not so friendly...they walked by me several times and didn't say a word.  Since I was new to the store, it would've been nice to learn where to find a club or how do I go about trying out a club I want to buy...instead, I learned it on my own reading pamphlets and hard to read signs and basically making assumptions based on what I observed...they weren't that busy, so my impression was that they were lazy.  I remember Golf Galaxy back in Vegas and how awesome their employees were...if they could come here to this place, it would be a perfect fit.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

I don't mind opening up my wallet, but when there are other options available, I won't do it.

VI am a regular Hertz customer, so to try another rental car company is a rare occurrence. However, for my most recent trip to Scottsdale, AZ I went with Payless.  Why?  Because Hertz wanted $180 for a 1 day rental and Payless gave me a rate of $29!  Seriously!\u000a\u000aMy expectations were very low as I've rented from Payless before and wasn't too impressed.  I booked my reservation online via Expedia.  I took the airport shuttle from baggage claim to the car rental center which is a couple of miles away from the airport.\u000a\u000aIt was easy to find Payless, they're located at the middle-left side of the rental center sharing a space with Fox Rent a Car.  When I arrived, there was 1 person in line at Payless and 20 people in line at Fox....I think the people at Fox were jealous of how quickly we were able to get assistance...ha!\u000a\u000aThe check-in process was pretty fast, but it was a little frustrating having to give all of my information again....I guess their reservation system is not interfaced with Expedia because they didn't have any of my personal info and had to manually input it.\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait, I was given my contract and told to take the escalator down to the 1st floor where the Payless cars were located.  When I got to the 1st floor I went to the car rental desk which had 5 employees and 1 customer at the counter.  1 employee was helping the customer while the other 4 employees had a conversation that was too important to breakup and come help me.  After a "are you going to f_cking help me?" look from me to one of them they broke it up and came over to assist.\u000a\u000aThey gave me the keys to my car, a Honda Civic, and I went on my way.  The car was really nice and drove well.  It had a lot of power and room despite being a compact car.  Easily the best compact rental car I've driven.\u000a\u000aOverall Value - I definitely got my money's worth here.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  If they beat Hertz's rates by a wide margin like this trip, yes.....otherwise I'll stick with Hertz and their Gold Club customer service.

VWanted to rent a car for The Better Half to use on a road trip and found this place on Expedia.  It was the lowest priced car rental joint in the Phoenix area, so we made a reservation.  When we arrived they asked her to provide a copy of 2 utility bills and a copy of our insurance....what?!  I've rented a car hundreds of times and have never heard of such a thing.  I thought I was going crazy and laughed....the person working the desk was serious.  They require 2 utility bills and a copy of your insurance?! To rent a friggin' car?! FAIL\u000a\u000aI quickly jumped on my iPhone and booked another reservation with Enterprise.  10 min later, we were in our rental car.\u000a\u000aThis company has no clue.  Who the hell keeps a copy of their utility bills nowadays?  I don't.  I either have them electronically and don't have paper copies or I throw them away immediately.  This company is a pure joke in my mind.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 0%

Luckily, someone in the office told me to go to a post office, which was perfect because this one is conveniently located nearby.\u000a\u000aI waited in a short line, which seemed to take forever.  The postal workers at the window were not very friendly and were slow in getting the transactions completed.  The USPS has really went downhill....I remember when I was a kid, they were friendly and fast and proud to be a USPS worker.  Now, it seems like they hate their job.\u000a\u000aOh well, I didn't let it bother me.  I bought the money order, dropped it in the mail, then took off.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

It wouldn't be too bad if we were able to keep our buzz going, but they stopped serving Beer in the 7th inning and we lost our buzz by the 10th.\u000a\u000aGood thing the Dbacks won....we listed to the end of the game on 620 on the drive home.  Let's hope the rest of the season goes good.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

There's a guy (can't remember his name) that works the front cashier desk who's very friendly and always cracks jokes when you're cashing out...he's always got me laughing....mostly because he cracks jokes with some people in front of me and they don't get it, so they don't laugh, but I do....Scottsdale can be a bit stuffy at times.

VI've been to a few Coyotes games over the past couple of years and I have to say that I'm very impressed.  The team delivers the goods to it's fans.  Last year, I thought they had what it took to win a championship.  They played really hard and then fell to the eventual Stanley Cup champ, LA Kings.  Not a bad way to end the season.  For that, the hockey team of players, when their playing deserves 5 Stars.\u000a\u000aHowever, the team ownership can't get their financial act together and as a result has put this team in limbo.  Can fans count on them staying in town?  Who knows?  They get 0 Stars.\u000a\u000aThe players also deserve 0 Stars for causing the lockout that almost cost an entire season.  Hasn't the NHL learned anything about this kind of stuff?  It almost decimated their league a few years ago.\u000a\u000aSimply. Ridiculous.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%  (if they played in Scottsdale or anywhere on the East Side, it would be 100%)

A professional who listens to your concerns and doesn't just jump into prescribing medication or recommending surgery.  He explains what's going on and what he recommends for treatment.  If you don't feel comfortable with it, he'll offer alternative treatment options.  This is how all doctors should be.  You also don't feel rushed, like you're a number.\u000a\u000aI'm glad I found Dr Hurley and most of all, I'm glad he's covered by my insurance!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

Since most employees who work in places like this don't stay very long, I knew he wouldn't be around for very long.  After about 6 months, I went back to use this location and he was in fact no longer working there...good.\u000a\u000aNow I use this place form time to time to send out packages or faxes when I'm out of the office.

VIt's the closest dollar store to our neighborhood, so we come here frequently.  There's not many dollar stores in Scottsdale, so it's nice to have one close.  We drop in here to pick up cleaning supplies, candy, and other random stuff we don't want to pay a fortune for.  In today's economic climate, you have to save pennies where you can.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dollar-tree-store-3639-scottsdale?select=r3WXRlm4TSLD2nz_UniQxQ#r3WXRlm4TSLD2nz_UniQxQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dollar-tree-store-3639-scottsdale?select=6Thjihuv3nw1C2kMhAkQZA#6Thjihuv3nw1C2kMhAkQZA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dollar-tree-store-3639-scottsdale?select=hsmjCTApJB-Fhl6lOOn6xg#hsmjCTApJB-Fhl6lOOn6xg\u000a\u000aThe store doesn't get too busy, like other stores of this type.  The people here are friendly.  The only downside to this store is that it's much smaller than most dollar stores.  I can live with that in exchange for the convenience.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VI do not donate blood, but I understand why it's important to have a blood bank.  Instead, I donate money and support their fundraisers to help generate the funds that are necessary to administer blood drives.\u000a\u000aUnited Blood Services does a great job of community outreach and provides a valuable resource to help increase the blood supply.  Their staff is very friendly and helps assist people who want to put together their blood drive events.  They'll send information packets and will also provide resources on site to help organizers execute the day of the drive.\u000a\u000aTheir fundraiser events are also very fun and informative.  Kudos to their event team!  We always look forward to their annual gala.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VThe Better Half and I visited this place for the 1st time last week.  I am a huge fan!  Here's why:\u000a\u000a- Easy access off of Harmon Ave, which is off the Strip.\u000a\u000a- The property has two entrances on the Strip.  You can sit at a bar or slot machine and have an awesome view of the street level of the Strip.  I bet this will be a great spot on NYE!\u000a\u000a- I love the design and decor of the property (see pics).  Chandeliers, various designs in different areas of the casino floor are very impressive.  The artwork here is great too and all over the place.....you have to see it for yourself!\u000a\u000a- Jason the Jeweler (designer of the Lakers' 2010 Championship Ring) has a store here.\u000a\u000a- Although we didn't eat here, the food options look great.  We want to come back and try Holsteins & STK.\u000a\u000a- The employees are very friendly and have a great attitude.  I know they just opened and you should expect that, but believe me it's hard to find that attitude here in Vegas.\u000a\u000a- Parking was easy.  The self-parking garage is underground and has the meters that show you how many spaces are available on each level, bonus.\u000a\u000a- The bars & lounges here are very cool.  We had drinks at Bond and the Chandelier Lounge.  Both places were comfortable and provided great people watching seats.\u000a\u000aOverall, we enjoyed the place and have a bunch of places we want to come back and try out.  I hope they make it in this economy.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Are you crazy?  Of course I will!

VTime for a review update.  When I wrote my first review in late 2010, the joint just opened up.  Now, almost 3 yrs later and more than a dozen visits to this joint, I can say that it's my #1 place to visit when I go back to Vegas.  Besides all of the points I've already made in my prior review, here's why:\u000a\u000a+ We've dined at several restaurants (Secret Pizza, Holsteins, Comme Ca, STK, Jaleo, Wicked Spoon, The Henry) and all of them are awesome.\u000a\u000a+ The Chandelier Bar is our place to meet up friends and colleagues to get our night started.  The 3 level bar is great for meeting groups of people, having drinks, and people watching.  The 1st level is especially good for people watching.\u000a\u000a+ Speaking of people watching....park yourself at Bond, like we do and you can watch the shenanigans on the Strip from your comfortable chair/sofa while having drinks and listening to great music.\u000a\u000a+ FREE WiFi throughout the property...yes, FREE with no strings attached.\u000a\u000a+ Marquee Nightclub is one of my favorite in town.  Their VIP Cabanas are an awesome place to hang out.\u000a\u000a\u000a+ The rooms are amazing.  Get one overlooking the Bellagio Fountains, it's one of the most spectacular views in Vegas.\u000a\u000a+ The artwork around the property is awesome, there's tons of fun things you will spot if you look carefully enough.\u000a\u000aOverall, this place is simply amazing.  If you've never been, you have to put it on your 'to do' list if you're coming to Vegas.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VThe kid wanted to pick up a few casual clothes so I took him here to do some shopping.  He was able to find a few things....sweats, t-shirts, and other random stuff.\u000a\u000aThis store is much cleaner and nicer than most of the others in town.  I'm guessing it's one of the newer stores because of the neighborhood it's in.  The employees were nice and helped him find what he was looking for.  Overall, it was a decent shopping day.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VPart of the Pizza Bender Tour 2011 Edition, this place came recommended by Yelper Jessie B.  I had this place bookmarked, but forgot about it until she mentioned that I might enjoy the Laduca Hero.  So, I made the drive out to this joint as soon as I could fit it in my schedule.  The place serves fresh food and also deli items to take home....and it's decked out in New York Giants stuff....pennants, posters, pictures, etc.  I came here for the food, not to watch sports, so what do I care?!\u000a\u000aHere's the breakdown of what I ordered:\u000a\u000aLaduca's Hero $7.49 (Proscuitto, Cappocolla, Mortadella, Salami, Provolone, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Dressing)\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_HrCJz_uXDumBhdxCrug7Q?select=ZBp23lke_JRM706KDByCiQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_HrCJz_uXDumBhdxCrug7Q?select=SH4XFtBdqM5bAyXhJ6x23A\u000a\u000aSlice of Sausage Pizza $2\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_HrCJz_uXDumBhdxCrug7Q?select=gnXfZREjW-ZttJn2bqoqmw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_HrCJz_uXDumBhdxCrug7Q?select=JLS_UPj416kvrld6hcdHFQ\u000a\u000aI started with the Laduca's Hero Sandwich, which was pretty big.  The Bread is a Hard Roll Italian Bread.....so if you're not into Hard Rolls, this may not be for you.  The combination of Meats and ingredients was very good and tasty.  I could have used more Dressing on it though....it was a little dry, but I enjoyed the Sandwich very much.  Fresh ingredients and well made Sammie!\u000a\u000aNext up was the Slice of Sausage Pizza.  This year's Bender Tour has been the Year of the Sausage Pizza.....I don't know, but I've been craving it this time around.  The Crust is New York Thin Crust and there is a ton of Cheese on this bad boy!  If you want to eat this with your hands, you have to fold it.....otherwise you have no chance.  The Sauce is minimal....it could have used a little more Sauce in my opinion.  The Sausage was excellent.....freshly made and full of flavor....yum!\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a pretty good experience....food solid, service OK.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%.....would be higher if I lived nearby.

VWas going to do an afternoon study session at the Starbucks next door and stopped by this joint for lunch.  If you close your eyes and walk in the door, you couldn't tell if you're in a Zaba's, Chipotle, or Q'doba.  What the hell are these chains doing?\u000a\u000aBack to the experience....I ordered a Steak Burrito w/Pinto Beans, Rice, Cheese, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Salsa, and Hot Sauce on a Whole Wheat Tortilla.  Of course the Guac was extra.  I also ordered a side of Chips & Queso Dip.....yeah, I was hungry.\u000a\u000aThey make it in front of you, so there's no wait.  Had a bottle of Water to wash it down.\u000a\u000aThe Burrito is so/so.....it ranks a distant 3rd behind Q'doba & Chipotle for me.  The Steak was a little tough and didn't have much flavor.  The Hot Sauce/Beans/Guac had all of the flavor.  The Whole Wheat Tortilla was tasty.....don't know if it was healthy, but I'm going to just tell myself to believe it was OK?\u000a\u000aThe Chips & Queso Dip were very good.....but I was gaining poundage with each bite.....started to regret ordering it.....tasted awesome, but felt guilty consuming extra calories.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was OK.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Eh....maybe.

VAfter reading @Ken's review, I decided I'd add my 2 cents about Rhodes Ranch.  Here's my breakdown of +/-:\u000a\u000a+ The security gate actually checks people who come in/out of the community.\u000a\u000a- The line to get in can get really long and the wait is kind of ridiculous.....it's not a military base for Pete's sake!\u000a\u000a+ The public space is wide open and full of trees and greenery, which is rare in Vegas nowadays.\u000a\u000a+ They have one of the nicer community golf courses in town.  I enjoy playing here from time to time.\u000a\u000a- I think they put too many lower end homes in this housing development.  There are some nice homes, but then there are some really small homes that people aren't really taking good care of and it's an eyesore.  Luckily I don't live in there, but my friend's who do aren't too happy with some of their neighbors.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a nice neighborhood and the community is pretty cool.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 99.6%

VThis location is on my regular rotation of Pawn Shops.  As I've mentioned in other reviews of other Pawn Shops, I enjoy shopping for jewelry at these places....great deals can be found from time to time.  This location has yielded a few necklaces in the past.  It doesn't have quite the selection as my favorite location (Valley View & Desert Inn), but it's proximity to the Strip makes it a must stop just in case a careless tourist decides to pawn something off that might interest me.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VPhat Phrank's has been on my 'To Do List' for a very long time.  I had a meeting on the other side of town and had to pass by the Decatur & 215 exit on the way home around lunchtime, so I decided to finally give Phat Phrank's a try.\u000a\u000aSince I'm on my Lent 'No Meat' diet, I was browsing the menu for Meatless items.  The man behind the register asked me if he could help out....I told him my situation and he was very happy to help me decide what to get.  He suggested a Cheese Enchilada ($6.99).\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA?select=diO_EDsbajdUCPr988G3Ng\u000aI went with his suggestion and also added a Bean & Cheese Burrito ($4.29) for good measure.....ha!\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA?select=ufDngqGNAIWOrMqXuAzvng\u000a\u000aHe chatted me up while ringing up my order and I discovered he was Phrank, the owner.  He's such a cool guy.  He's from So Cal and we were talking a bit about the State as I'm also a So Cal transplant.....although I left many years before he did.\u000a\u000aAfter a few minutes he brought out my order.  I was pleased to see that the Cheese Enchilada also came with a side of Rice & Beans....although it meant that I ordered too much food.  Sometimes my stomach tricks me into these situations.  Oh well.\u000a\u000aI went for the Cheese Enchilada first....and yum!  It was very, very good.  I'm glad Phrank suggested it to me.  Next up was the Burrito.....unfortunately, after all of the flavor from the Enchilada, the Burrito tasted just OK.  For a Bean Burrito though, it was solid.  Next time I'm going to order just one or the other.\u000a\u000aI'll have to come back after Lent so I can try out some of the other signature dishes.  If they're as good as the Cheese Enchilada, I'll be back a lot.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 97%

VOk, I was heading home after checking out another Pizzeria and decided today was Pizza day and stopped by here to give it a try.\u000a\u000aI didn't expect to find a nice restaurant, but that's exactly what the place is like.  It's tucked between the Summerlin renowned Kona Grill & Gordon Biersch in the Boca Park Shopping Center.  This spot has failed numerous times over the past 5 years.....I hope these people make it.\u000a\u000aAnyway, I sat at the bar and ordered a Blue Moon.  They don't serve Pizza by the slice here....so I had to go for a 12" Personal Pizza.  Since I already had 3 slices from the other joint, I knew I had my work cut out for me despite the small size.  I decided on a Pepperoni & Jalapeno Pizza.....the bartender Aubrey or was it Audrie?....anyway, she said the Jalapenos kick your ass, so was I sure I wanted it......of course I do!\u000a\u000aThe restaurant has a cool & comfortable feel to it.  I'll have to bring the family back sometime soon.\u000a\u000aAfter a few minutes my Pizza came out.  It was much larger than I expected.  The thin crust was cooked nice and cripsy....well done, just how I like it.  However, there is a lot of sauce on this Pizza.....more than I normally like, -2 in my book.  \u000a\u000aThe flavor of the sauce overwhelms the Pizza, so it's hard to taste the other ingredients.  The Pepperoni is the tiny almost Slim Jim type and had good flavor to it....too bad it was drowned in sauce.  Aubrey/Audrie was right, the Jalapenos do pack a serious Punch.....I was sweating pretty good after a couple of slices, and no it wasn't from the 100 degree DRY Vegas heat....it was from the Jalapenos.....good thing Aubrey/Audrie kept my Blue Moon full.\u000a\u000aOverall, I enjoyed the atmosphere, service, and the Pizza.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Yes, I will bring the family with me next time and try a different pie.

VThis place is M-A-S-S-I-V-E.....literally millions of sq feet of Home Decor, Furniture, and everything you can think of to decorate an interior.  The key to this place is to get yourself a business license or go along with someone who has one, then find yourself a few good sales reps so they can get you access.\u000a\u000aIf you are looking to buy something for your personal use, 70-80% of the companies in this place will not allow you to place really small orders.  Most have a minimum purchase requirement, which is where your friend with a business license comes into play.  If they have a legit order going through, then you can piggyback it and get yourself a few things at wholesale.\u000a\u000aHere's another tip - Go about 4 to 6 weeks before a Furniture Show, which they have 2 to 3 times per year.  The reason for this is because the companies will redesign their floorspace and the designers are told to liquidate in some cases up to 100% of the showroom.....what that means is that oftentimes you will find products here up to 90% below wholesale....seriously.  You just have to know the right people.  In some cases you can buy an entire showroom for $5,000-$10,000....where you get $50,000-$60,000 worth of merchandise (wholesale value).\u000a\u000aAnother crazy thing that happens here before shows is that whatever product can't be liquidated will get thrown away.  There are designated aisles for trash inside the building....so, what happens is that designers will place the old merchandise in these aisles to be thrown out.  There is nothing wrong with these items, but they have to be liquidated to make room for the new product lines.  If you're lucky and you know the right people and are there at the right time, you can pick up some really good, expensive stuff for FREE!  I know because I've done it many times.\u000a\u000aLucky for me, I know a few sales reps who sell product lines I like.  They call me when it's liquidation time.  I love it!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet your a$$!

VWas meeting with a friend who lives nearby and decided to stop by here for a quick lunch before the meeting.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant is very clean and it looks like it recently opened.  The menu was pretty extensive, so I went for an old standard....the Carne Asada Burrito, which I thought was a bit pricey for $4.99 as I've found some really good places lately much cheaper than that.  \u000a\u000aWhile I was waiting for my food, I noticed a small Salsa Bar in the corner.  It was your typical bar with Green & Red Chile Salsa and the pickled vegetables.\u000a\u000aI didn't have to wait long for my Burrito.  The size of the Burrito was large...they definitely didn't hold back.  After the first bite, the flavor tasted familiar.....it took me a few more bites before I placed it.....it tasted exactly like Roberto's Carne Asada Burrito.  From the the flavor of the meat to the Guacamole Salsa to the Flour Tortilla....it was IDENTICAL!\u000a\u000aI'm not a huge fan of Roberto's, so I was underwhelmed.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Eh...if I'm hungry and in a pinch....but it's not my first preference when I'm looking for a Taco Shop.

VI live around the corner from this place and split my visits to the Pharmacy between this CVS and the Walgreens across the street.  It's a matter of convenience between which one I select.\u000a\u000aPROS\u000a- Conveniently located next to an Albertson's.....I can get my grocery shopping out of the way with the same visit.\u000a\u000a- It's rarely busy.....so I can get in/out of here quickly.\u000a\u000a- Plenty of parking.\u000a\u000a- Drive Thru Pharmacy.....I rarely use this feature, but I'm glad it's there just in case.\u000a\u000a- Large selection of items.\u000a\u000aCONS\u000a- The rare occasions that it's busy, they are understaffed and the lines can get long and take forever.\u000a\u000aOverall, I enjoy visiting this CVS.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Yes.

However, over the past year or so, they've improved their product offering and we've found several pieces of jewelry at a great price here.\u000a\u000aI no longer find golf clubs here, but the improvement in jewelry selection bumps them up 1 Star for me.

VStopped by this place during a Gorman Football game, which was going on down the street.  This place was packed to the hilt!  There was literally no room to walk around, let alone find a place to sit.  Luckily, I scored a seat in the rear corner of the bar.\u000a\u000aI ordered a drink and wanted to try their Double Stacked Sliders.  Wish I could remember what was in the Sliders, but I can't.....let's just say it was a long night.  I can tell you that out of the 3 Sliders, I really liked one of them and didn't care for the other two.  The Fries were OK, not great.\u000a\u000aDespite the large crowd, the bartenders were on top of their game and the service was really good.  The food was hot and fresh and my glass was never empty....for this, they get 4 Stars.  If it was purely on the food, it would get 3 Stars.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Sure.

VThree Square Food Bank is the local non-profit that supplies food and household items to area charities for distribution to those in need.  They don't distribute directly to families, instead they collect all of the items, sort it, and sell it to organizations who serve the needy.\u000a\u000aMy family has been volunteering here for over 2 yrs.  My Son spends many hours during the Summer and my Wife and I volunteer when we can.  There are many jobs that you can work.  Most of the time we help in the warehouse area sorting food and household items.  It's monotonous work, but if volunteers don't do it the work doesn't get done quickly as there are so many items to sort.\u000a\u000aThe facility is large and well kept.  The workers there are passionate about their job and are very patient with us volunteers.  With so many volunteers that rotate in/out of the place they must have a lot of patience to train us.\u000a\u000aI encourage everyone to consider doing it.  It's really easy to sign up.....fill out a form online and then show up on scheduled dates/times.  Here's the link to more info and to the online volunteer form:\u000ahttp://www.threesquare.org/how-to-help/volunteer/\u000a\u000aWe enjoy working here and will continue to volunteer as long as we're a part of this community.

VOne of the bad cab companies we used during a recent Vegas trip.  The cab driver tried to long haul us when we asked him to drive us from the Rio to the Luxor.  Instead of jumping on the I-15 and exiting on Tropicana, he was going to take us one exit further, which would have cost us another $8-$10.\u000a\u000aWhen I asked him "Dude, are you going to exit on Trop?", he said "You're going to the Luxor right? I'm taking you there.".....I said "I used to live here for many yrs, don't bulls__t me and exit on Trop."\u000a\u000aHe did and wasn't happy about it.  Guess what, he got $0 tip from me.  They get a % of their fare anyway and we can't control that....but the last thing I was going to do was give this guy a tip for trying to long haul me.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 5%

VI normally don't shop around here, but I was in the neighborhood and wanted to pick up some stuff to make Sandwiches.  This was my first trip to this Albertson's.\u000a\u000aI was able to pick up everything I needed......Lettuce, Provolone Cheese, Peppered Salami, Pepperoni, Capacollo, Bread, and Balsamic Dressing.\u000a\u000aThe store itself wasn't as clean as I like my grocery stores to be.  The floors were dirty in many areas and it appears as if it's always that way....there was just too many dirty floors.\u000a\u000aThey have self-checkout registers and I was able to get in/out in 10 minutes.  Pretty good for 4:30 pm on a Thursday.\u000a\u000aI got home and made the Sandwich (see pics)....it was delish and I am full now.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Probably not....it's not in my neighborhood and there are other places I'd rather shop.

VThis Subway is around the corner from my house and I just found it after living in the neighborhood for 3 1/2 yrs!  It's located in a non-descript building kind of set back from the road next to the 7-11, which is probably why I've never noticed it before.\u000a\u000aAnyway, I ordered my usual 12" BMT toasted w/Green Peppers, Mustard, Mayo, Onions, Salt/Pepper, Oregano, Oil, Vinegar, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Provolone.  The Sandwich Artist did an OK job with the Sammie....she went a little light on the Veggies, so that was the only downside to it.\u000a\u000aOverall, an OK experience at Subway.  Glad I found one so close to home!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VI was meeting a friend at Geri's Old Philadelphia (next door) and had a 1/2 hour to kill since I got there early....so, I wandered in this joint to have a couple of Beers while I burned some time.\u000a\u000aThe place is really, really dark.  It took my eyes a few minutes to adjust to the darkness.  After I got my bearings, I saddled up to the bar and asked the bartender what they had on tap.  He said they had no domestics on tap and mumbled off a short list....all I remember hearing was Alaskan Ale, so I said let's go for that.  Wait, isn't that domestic?  Ha, ok....\u000a\u000aHe brought me a pint and I sat back and watched Sports Center while a handful of guys played Video Poker at the bar.  They serve food here as I saw a patron get a Burger & Fries.....the weird thing is that they allow smoking at the Bar...hmmm, you're not suppose to be able to eat and smoke in the same place.  They must not care about getting fined.  Whatever....the place smells like a smoker's den, so I guess it attracts smokers.  I don't think the regulars care.\u000a\u000aThe bartender was friendly but quiet....not much of a talker.\u000a\u000aI had my 2 Beers and left to meet my buddy for lunch @ Geri's.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Probably not...this was a one-hitter quitter, not really my style of bar.

VCame here with The Better Half (TBH) for lunch the other day.  They have a special price of $3.99 right now.  I've come to enjoy CiCi's Pizza when I'm looking for cheap eats.\u000a\u000aThis location is by far the lowest end one that I've visited.  It's a little dirtier than the other two locations I've been.  However, those two are the two newest.\u000a\u000aThe Pizza is still the same here as the other locations, so at least the food is consistent.  We piled our plates high and left full.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  It's in my neighborhood, so the chances are high.

VTook my Son here for lunch last week.  We enjoy our CiCi's lunches....there's always a great selection of Pizza.  So, why did I bump them up a Star?  Because while we were there a soccer team with over 20 kids plus their families and coaches came in to eat.....and the CiCi's staff kept up with the massive demand of Pizza.  They'e really good at their jobs....and the Pizza is decent too.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You can count on it.

VI decided to stop there today for lunch.  It is around the corner from my house, so it was very convenient.\u000a\u000aFood - There were so many sandwiches that looked good.  I decided to go with the Elliott Ness....which was Hot Pastrami, Cole Slaw, and Fries in a Hard Roll.  The sandwich was very good.  Not the best I've ever had, but good.  The fries were large, steak fries.  I thought there was too many fries and not enough pastrami.  \u000a\u000aThe size of the sandwich was perfect.  I don't like sandwiches that are too small or large.  I was concerned that the Hard Roll might be too hard, but it was just right.\u000a\u000aFor side orders, I got chips and a soda.  This place is rated as a single $ for price...which is suppose to be $10 or less....but I rated it $$.....1 sandwich, chips, and a soda was $12.21.\u000a\u000aThere were only 2 types of chips to choose from....regular and cheetos.....I wish they had more to choose from.  There were a lot of fresh made dessert items to choose from and Tastykakes for those of you from back East....I know my East Coast friends go bananas over them.\u000a\u000aService - everyone there was very nice and the food came out fast and fresh.  There was a guy who delivered your sandwich to your table and cleaned up after you.  That surprised me...nice touch.  You can tell it's a family run business....I hope they never lose that connection.\u000a\u000aI rated it 4 Stars.  There are so many other items I want to try here....it could move up to 5 stars if I get blown away by one of the other sandwiches and if they get a more diverse chip selection.\u000a\u000aWill I come back?  You can bet on it.....

V2nd time visiting Eddie D's....this time I had a Johnny Sacks sandwich.  That is Hot Cappicola, Prosciutto, Provolone Cheese, Tomato, Lettuce, Oil/Vinegar on a Hard Roll.  The sandwich was awesome.  I had fries as a side order.  They were too much for me to handle, so I didn't finish.  Overall, very good experience.\u000a\u000aI'm glad this place is located a few blocks from my house.  You can count on me returning.

VStopped by for Lunch and had a Johnny Sack (Hot Capacola, Sharp Provolone, Prosciutto, Lettuce, and Tomatoes soaked in Balsamic Vinegar & Olive Oil) $8.49.  \u000a\u000aOne thing you should know is that most of their Sandwiches are made with their signature "Hard Roll", which is hard Italian Bread.  If you don't like Hard Bread, you may not enjoy this place.  I think they offer other Bread, but I'd call before you come down here.\u000a\u000aThis was my 2nd time trying the Johnny Sack.....damn, it was good!  So good, I'm upping my rating for this joint to 5 Stars.  The kicker for me was the Tomatoes soaked in Balsamic Vinegar & Olive Oil....wow, that Sweet/Sour flavor brought out the flavors of the Meat & Sharp Provolone....what a great combination of ingredients!  The Johnny Sack didn't have that the last time I was here.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Don't be silly....of course!

VI needed to fax a pretty large document and stopped by here to get it done.  The old guy working the counter was pretty cool and took care of it, watching every page (23 pages) go through the fax machine, one by one, to make sure nothing went wrong.  Since it was a very important document, I'm very thankful for his personal attention.  I wish he wore a name tag so I could give him props.....he probably owns the joint.\u000a\u000aI don't live nearby, so the chances I'll return are pretty low, but that is not indicative of the service here.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 20%

VI'm not ashamed to admit that every once in a while, I get a Bic Mac Attack and have to have some McDonald's.  Well, it happened last weekend while I was at the Galleria Mall to watch the B-Boy Battle Swagger competition.\u000a\u000aI ordered a Big Mac and one of the new Angus Beef Bacon Cheeseburgers.  To wash it down, I ordered a bottle of Water.....hey, I had to do something healthy to not feel so bad, right?\u000a\u000aThe food came out on time, but they were out of bottled Water....so they gave me the one on display.....huh?! I thought it was hilarious.\u000a\u000aAnyway, I got my Big Mac fix and thought the Angus Bacon Cheeseburger was alright.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Only during the next Big Mac Attack.

VWas Starvin' like Marvin yesterday morning and went to the drive thru to grab something on the way to an early morning meeting.  While I don't eat at McDonald's too often, this one in particular was impressive....why?  Well, for starters they open both drive thru windows, which makes it go 2x faster.....many fast food places no longer open the second window and it takes forever to get through.\u000a\u000aI ordered 2 Sausage McMuffin Sandwiches and a Bottle of Water.  The service was quick, the food was hot and fresh.  What more could I ask for?\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Next time I'm in a pinch for breakfast, you bet!

VThe only reason why I shop here is because it is the closest supermarket to my house.  I really don't like this place for the following reasons:\u000a\u000a- The deli area is small and has limited items.\u000a- There is a very small selection of bread.  Try to find Whole Grain Wheat Bread.\u000a- The floor of the store is often dirty.\u000a- Unsupervised teenagers loiter in front of the store during the summer months and at night.\u000a- The vegetable section is very small.\u000a\u000aI don't know if this place can turn around....I wish there was another place closer to home.  Oftentimes I shop at Smith's or Vons when I come home from the gym because I don't like shopping here.

VAfter the disaster of an experience with a different Fedex-Kinko's location, I came back today to my favorite one.  I had to print several documents and was able to easily get in/out by using their Self-Service Copier/Printer.  All I had to do was insert my credit card, then insert my USB Flash Drive, select the documents to print....and BAM!\u000a\u000aSee, that was easy wasn't it?  Why can't their much larger location on W Lake Mead & Tenaya get it right?  I don't get it.....\u000a\u000aWill I return?  To this location, you bet!

VOne of the newest libraries in the valley, it is a very clean and comfortable place.  I come here to study several times per month.  \u000a\u000aThere is FREE wireless internet, although it's horribly slow.\u000a\u000aThere are always events for children.\u000a\u000ait's located next to the Centennial Hills Park and the YMCA.\u000a\u000aWill I come back?

VIt's been a few months since I've been to this library to study.  Dropped by today and remember why I love this location.  It's my favorite one of the Clark County Libraries.\u000a\u000aThe furniture is comfortable and there are plenty of power outlets nearby for your laptop.  The other thing I noticed this visit is that the design of the entrance/lobby reminds me of Aria @ City Center.

VI don't come in here often because the products are sub-par and the selection is limited.  We like to come here after a holiday to pick up holiday items on the cheap.  The best time is after Valentine's Day and after Halloween.....you can find some stuff for future Halloween Parties, ie plates, napkins, decorations for 75%+ off.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Only on those occasions above.

VI like this radio station because they play a bunch of Old School songs from the 80's & 90's and mix it in with some newer stuff.  Very mainstream though.  It's always a fun station to listen to.

VTucked away in the town of Paradise Valley, this place is a local legend.  It was one of the first places I visited when I moved here a couple of years ago.  Since then, we come here every once in a while to meet friends for drinks or to entertain people from out of town.  The Better Half and I enjoy the "Southwestern" decor and atmosphere here, but it's done in an upscale & classy way.\u000a\u000aWhen we dine here, my fav menu items are:\u000a\u000a9 oz Filet, $41\u000aTruffle Fries, $7\u000aScalloped Potatoes, $7\u000a\u000aI try not to come here when I'm super hungry because the Filet is only 9 oz.  It's very good and the portion is just right for a normal hunger level, but it's kind of small for a big appetite night.  The Truffle Fries are amazing and the Scalloped Potatoes are delish....but filling.\u000a\u000aWe enjoy sitting outside here.  They keep their exterior furniture very clean and it's comfortable, especially during the Fall & Spring.  The building & complex is huge....I guess they can do fairly large special events here.  The only special events I've attended here are business mixers or industry cocktail events....but I've heard it's fantastic for weddings, anniversaries, and reunions as well.\u000a\u000aThe service here is great.  Nice employees who are friendly and accommodating work here.  There's plenty of parking in the back or a valet service if you choose to use it up front.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 91%

VFound this place via Groupon.  It's located near ASU in Tempe.  It's a dive bar for sure.  The bathrooms have graffiti all over the place and stickers of rock/punk bands.  Also, the bathrooms look pretty bad.\u000a\u000aHowever, the food is pretty good.  The Wings are excellent.  We ordered a dozen Wings, $6.50.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/long-wongs-at-the-firehouse-tempe-3?select=5x7RkD8yypLSOC_7uvVipQ#5x7RkD8yypLSOC_7uvVipQ\u000a\u000aWe also ordered an Extra Large Provence, France Pizza (Organic Tomato Sauce, Fresh Basil, Mozzarella, Roasted Garlic, Artichoke Hearts, Capers & Sliced Tomato), $18.50.  The Pizza is delish and cut in large slices that can fill you up fast.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/long-wongs-at-the-firehouse-tempe-3?select=d5M5w7yM1iKev7KiJ5MwyA#d5M5w7yM1iKev7KiJ5MwyA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/long-wongs-at-the-firehouse-tempe-3?select=T5drfXllBmopHcGQd3Mdeg#T5drfXllBmopHcGQd3Mdeg\u000a\u000aI guess this place used to be a Firehouse or something at some point.  Every time a fire truck goes by with a siren blasting, they offer a Beer discount of some kind.  We came in here for lunch and couldn't partake in that deal, so I don't have the details.  However, a regular was in there and would order a Beer every time a siren went by....he mumbled something to us about it, hilarious.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 83%

VI've lived in the neighborhood for almost 3 years and I never knew about this location.  I've been going to the Whole Foods on W. Charleston the entire time....burning countless gallons of gas driving the extra 2.5 miles each way!\u000a\u000aI happened to stumble across this location because I was at the Fedex Kinko's in the same shopping center.  This location is tucked away and if you aren't looking for it, it can be easily missed....which is why I'm sure I never noticed it before.\u000a\u000aIt's a smaller location than the normal Whole Foods, but you can get most of the staples here.  That's what prevented me from giving it 5 Stars.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Hell yah, and I'll save gas while am I it too....Bonus!

VAnother 80's cover band, they're goofy outfits and act is very entertaining.  I've seen them at the Suncoast way back when and most recently at the South Point.  They always draw a nice crowd and vibe.  You can't help but have a good time when you see them.\u000a\u000aI recommend checking them out if you're in the area.

VI've been curious about Total Wine for a long time.  I happened to be in the area meeting a friend for lunch at Kona Grill, so I stopped in here for a few minutes to look for a hard to find Tequila.  I was browsing the aisles when a very friendly employee, Annett, approached me to help me out.  I told her what I was looking for (Centinela Tres Anos Tequila).\u000a\u000aShe said they didn't carry it and couldn't special order it.  However, she suggested that I contact the manufacturer to see if they can distribute it to Nevada.  If they could, they would order it for me.  I was very impressed by her level of customer service.\u000a\u000aWandering the aisles, I couldn't help but feel like this was an upscale version of Lee's.  However, the prices were pretty comparable.  I'll have to come back when I'm shopping for Wine.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VGarden of the Dragon recently opened for lunch hour.  I've eaten here three times in the past month.\u000a\u000aAppetizer - I always get the sweet & sour cucumbers.  There's just enough chili pepper in them to give it a nice kick.  The pork potstickers are excellent as well.  Kimchee is offered on the menu, but I'm not a fan....so I have no opinion of that dish.\u000a\u000aEntree - I usually get the vegetable fried rice.  It's not the best I've ever eaten, but it's good.\u000a\u000aDessert - I rarely get dessert here, but on my last visit I got a Mango Sorbet.  It was served on a dish and the server brought me a spoon to eat it with....which was very difficult because the hard texture made digging into it with a spoon challenging.  In the end, I used a fork to eat it.

VThanks to Living Social, we found the place.  With all of the options for dining in Old Town, we wouldn't have found this place without the deal.  It's a nice bar/sports bar type feel with well appointed patio seating.  We sat outside all 4 times we came here because the weather was perfect.\u000a\u000aHere's what we ordered:\u000a\u000aBottle of Santa Martina Red Blend, $26\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=nsNAAMUY7sNq9bOgScB93A#nsNAAMUY7sNq9bOgScB93A\u000a\u000aRnR Sliders, $9\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=hXj4aoapioaosLF-qZXPkg#hXj4aoapioaosLF-qZXPkg\u000a\u000aBacon Brussels Burger, $15\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=c_cVWHczMxL8ESy1gLCkkw#c_cVWHczMxL8ESy1gLCkkw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=KowEFn_SZfJzcZK6Za1QWQ#KowEFn_SZfJzcZK6Za1QWQ\u000a\u000aSouthwest Burger, $13\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=5G_nZ1dHbeWQzBRE0CBclg#5G_nZ1dHbeWQzBRE0CBclg\u000a\u000aBleu Cheese Burger, $13\u000a\u000aAnimal Fries\u000a\u000aHangover Fries\u000a\u000aNachos, $10\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=hQTl2WZOQXTKtP_KjXoW2A#hQTl2WZOQXTKtP_KjXoW2A\u000a\u000aThe Burgers here are really good.  Out of all of them, my favorite was the Southwest Burger...very good and juicy.\u000a\u000aThe Nachos were above average.  They use a healthy dose of Queso Cheese and it's pretty good.\u000a\u000aThe Animal Fries is nothing like the In-n-Out version....it's a huge pile of BBQ Pork on top of the Fries....very good and can easily feed 3 people.\u000a\u000aThe Hangover Fries was very unique....a little Egg on top of Cheesy Fries...yum!\u000a\u000aThe food here was the highlight because the service here is not that good.  During all 4 visits we had issues with slow service.  During one visit, we were seated at our table and it took 15 minutes before anyone came over to get our drink order....we were very close to leaving.  Because it's not easy to park and get here, it would've been a hassle to leave and go somewhere else, so we stuck around.  If they can improve their service, they'll have a good chance to make this a special spot in my mind.\u000a\u000aSome other random notes/tips:\u000a\u000a- There's an ATM in the back near the Men's restroom if you need cash.  It's kind of an odd spot for it.\u000a\u000a- Parking sucks, especially when there's a farmers market down there....they close off the parking structure in the back for the market so you're left to find street parking or park around the corner in one of the healthcare lots, which you're not supposed to do.\u000a\u000a- There's plenty of TV's and this place is an awesome spot to watch sports.\u000a\u000a- I really like the music they play here.  The nights we were there, they played upbeat house music....love it.\u000a\u000aOverall, I'd rate this place 3.5 Stars but rounding up to 4 because I think it has so much potential.  If the service continues to suck, I'll have to drop it.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VOne thing I hate about traveling is that you can't bring bottled Water past TSA checkpoints.....I know it's for our safety, but I still think it sucks.  So.....when I'm thirsty, I'm forced to walk into a place like Hudson News and pay through the nose for a bottle of Water.\u000a\u000aThen, while I'm there, I magically need to buy magazines, Candy, and other random stuff.....why???  Because I'm bored!  Stupid airport gift shop traps always work on me.....\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - a begrudging 90%

VI was in Scottsdale for 1 night and the local Yelpers on Talk suggested I check out Pomo, so I dropped by for dinner and to add a Scottsdale Pizza joint to my Pizza Bender Tour 2011 Edition.  I was solo and there was a 15-25 minute wait for a table.  I didn't mind and waited until my name was called.\u000a\u000aAfter a 20 min wait, I was seated.  My server's name was Michelle and she was very enthusiastic and helpful.  After browsing the menu, I decided to get the Don Alfonso (Tomatoes San Marzano DOP, Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Italian Salame Piccante, Italian Sausage, Roasted Bell Pepper, $14.95) and a glass of house Cabernet ($6).  The Pizza is Napoletana Style....Google it if you don't know what it is.\u000ahttp://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=napoletana+pizza\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait my Pizza was brought out.  I took a bite out of the first slice and instantly became a fan!  The Crust was soft and chewy and the ingredients were fresh....it reminded me of the Pizza I had in Napoli, Italy.  I finished the entire Pizza and still wanted more when I was finished.  The middle of the Pizza is soft and wet, so if you don't prefer your Pizza this way, don't come here.  You'll be missing out on some great Pizza though!\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Gv2aZfTlYImmsERZg5D93A?select=Me5jFmm9lrWCfKaRI4OtFQ\u000a\u000aAfter dinner Michelle suggested a dessert.  I went for the Bigne Al Cioccolato (Cream Puffs Filled With Light Pastry Cream and Drizzled With  Chocolate, $7.95).  I'm glad Michelle suggested it, because it was fantastic!  The Cream Puffs were excellent and the Chocolate wasn't too heavy....just the way I like it!\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Gv2aZfTlYImmsERZg5D93A?select=LEZcnTOv7H9irlpSm7dMhA\u000a\u000aOverall, it was an awesome dinner.  I'm glad I listened to the local AZ Yelpers.  Can't wait to come back.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 99%\u000a\u000aThis is for Lydia & MacRae - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOG3rD5CrQ

VI wish Yelp had a 1/2 Star system...this is another case where I would have given the joint 3.5 Stars.\u000a\u000aI've read a lot of reviews about Smash Burger and wanted to give it a try for myself.  Today was the day.  I ordered the Classic Smash Burger 1/3 lb and a Chicago Dog.\u000a\u000aThe woman working at the counter was very friendly.  I ordered it to eat in because I wanted to make sure I tasted it fresh out of the kitchen.  Within 5-6 minutes my order was ready.\u000a\u000aI decided to attack the Smash Burger first....I should have chosen the Dog...why?  Because the Beef was piping hot and it burned the hell out of my mouth!  Delicious though, but not awesome.  I could barely taste the special Smash Sauce, so the burger tasted kind of bland.....it was fresh though and the Egg Bun was awesome.\u000a\u000aNext I attacked the Chicago Dog.....the toppings and bun were excellent, but the Hot Dog itself wasn't great....just good.  This is where that 1/2 Star comes in again.\u000a\u000aAgain, overall I'd rate this place 3.5 Stars.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Yes, but it didn't surpass my beloved In-N-Out as so many reviews have said.

VOk, I finally tried out the Slider Truck today.  They were on my side of town, so everything fell into place.\u000a\u000aI was surprised when I went to the window to order...Rick recognized me.  It kind of shocked me when he called me by name...he must have been monitoring the Twitter account, because that was the only way he could have known I was coming because we've never met.  Anyway, that was impressive.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Barbie & the Pep Pep.  While I was waiting for my food, I noticed that most of the people who were there were repeat customers.  They have done a great job of promoting their business via social networking.\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait my food was ready.  I couldn't wait to try it out.  I first attacked the Barbie....it was very tasty and fresh.  It didn't take me long to devour it.  The BBQ sauce and jalapeno peppers went well together.  The Pep Pep was next....and it was even better.  I especially like the sauce.\u000a\u000aThe only reason I didn't give them 5 Stars is because of the eating experience itself.  It was pretty windy and I was planning to eat in my car....but because of how messy the sliders are, I didn't want to get it all over my car or clothes, so I ate outside.  It wasn't very pleasant or ideal.  I understand that's how it works with food trucks, but I guess that's why I'm not a fan of most.  At least they give you wet wipes to clean up.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  If they're located nearby or relatively close, I will.  i won't drive to the other side of town for it.

VI had the pleasure of playing in a charity golf tournament at this course recently and was impressed!  This golf course has nice views of the south side of the Valley and is tucked away next to South Mountain.  \u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arizona-grand-golf-course-phoenix?select=HRROHMnYKEnuyiNpCWve1Q#HRROHMnYKEnuyiNpCWve1Q\u000a\u000aThere are many hiking trails nearby....while we golfed, we could see hikers on the trails....it was kind of strange, I've never played at a golf course like this before.\u000a\u000aThe course itself is well kept and in great condition.  The layout of the course isn't too challenging, but offers a nice variety for golfers of all skill levels.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arizona-grand-golf-course-phoenix?select=_j7JWOAoZ5_4oPz6cGgliQ#_j7JWOAoZ5_4oPz6cGgliQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arizona-grand-golf-course-phoenix?select=O2TQPKIZD6uf7JQTXdVqXA#O2TQPKIZD6uf7JQTXdVqXA\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a lot of fun and we finished 1 stroke out of the money...darn!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

VI've heard a lot about Raising Cane's, so I decided to try it out for myself today for lunch.  I ordered the Chicken Sandwich Combo w/Fries & a Bottle of Water and I ordered two Chicken Strips on the side.\u000a\u000aSince I ordered it to dine in, they gave me a receipt and said they would bring it out to my table.  While I was waiting for my meal, I looked around and saw many customers enjoying their food.  I must be getting old because I felt like the music was way too loud in the restaurant.\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait the girl who took my order brought my food out.  I tried a few of the Fries first....they are the crinkled variety.....they were good, but not great.  Next I bit into the Chicken Sandwich.....***Caution, the Chicken is extremely hot***  I burned the hell out of my mouth with that first bite.....the Chicken must have come right out of the fryer.  Wow!  I couldn't taste anything because my taste buds were wiped off the face of the Earth!\u000a\u000aI munched on a few more Fries while I waited for the Chicken to cool down a bit.  After a few minutes I finished the rest of the Sandwich and thought it was good....but again, not great.  The Sauce in the Sandwich was the highlight.  The Chicken was just OK.....was kind of bland to me.  I then tried the 2 Chicken Strips I ordered on the side.....again, I thought they were kind of bland.  The quality of the Chicken was very good though.....nice, tender White Meat Chicken....just not enough flavor for my tastes.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Probably not....it just didn't "Wow" me.

VThanks to Groupon, we've dined at this place several times.  Each time, I've had the Beef Sandwich....here's how I order it:\u000a\u000a- Dry w/Gravy on the side (Choices are Dry, Dipped, Wet) \u000a- Hot Giardiniera Peppers (Choices are Hot or Sweet Peppers)\u000a- Provolone Cheese (Choices are Provolone, Cheddar, Cheese Whiz)\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/als-beef-scottsdale?select=jzfT8qobYwYp5wxuFxOF4g#jzfT8qobYwYp5wxuFxOF4g\u000a\u000aLet me tell you that the Beef is legit here!  This is an authentic Chicago Italian Beef Sandwich!  The Beef is moist, full of flavor, and the Bread holds it all together perfectly.  The Giardiniera is hot and spicy and makes the Sandwich even better.  I like to get the Gravy on the side so I can add more flavor as needed while I'm devouring the Sandwich.\u000a\u000aThe French Fries here are awesome too.  They remind me of the Fries at 5 Guys except they don't have the spice options that they offer there.  Doesn't matter, the Fries here are excellent....and addicting.  \u000a\u000aThe rest of the family loves this place too.  We're very happy to have it so close to our neighborhood.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 97%

VWhat was once known as the original MGM Grand Hotel & Casino, it has been Bally's for over 2 decades now.  The property is old and showing it's age.  However, it's not a bad place to visit.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a- Location location location.  It's on the corner of Flamingo and Las Vegas Blvd, which is the center of the Las Vegas Strip.  Easy access to many of the Strip casinos.\u000a\u000a- Monoral station.  The monorail station makes it easy to access hotels on the East side of the Strip.  Why wait and pay for taxis when you can just take the monorail.\u000a\u000a- It's connected to the Paris.  I'm a fan of the Paris and like to have easy access to both properties.  They're literally connected at the hip....you don't have to go outside to visit both places.\u000a\u000a- Sterling Buffet.  The Sterling Buffet on Sunday is one of the best Buffets in town.  Don't let the high price scare you, it's worth it.\u000a\u000a- It's classy.  Despite being an old property, it has remained a classy joint.  One of the few casinos that not only has that classic Vegas look, but that classic Vegas vibe as well.\u000a\u000aSome of the downsides....I wish they would update the property more often.  Besides the Sterling Buffet, there's not much here.  Paris has most of the good food joints.\u000a\u000aOverall, nice place to visit once in a while.\u000a\u000aWIll I return?  Sure.

VTime for a review update.  See my other review for details of the property which still apply.  Since my last review, they've moved the nightclub Drais to Bally's while they remodel the old "Bill's Gambling Hall" aka "Barbary Coast".  While it's not the same as when it was at the Barbary Coast, Drais is a fun place to go for afterhour partying.  Because of that, I'm bumping this place up a star to 4 Stars.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 85%

VMy friends....I think I've died and gone to Tapas Heaven....seriously.  The Better Half and I were at the Hard Rock and decided to check out Johnny Smalls.  You can imagine the look on our face when we saw the sign that said $19.99 AYCE....seriously, check out the pics.  We thought there was a catch and asked the hostess.  She said, no joke it's $19.99 per person.  You didn't have to ask us twice.....they were packed, so we were forced to saddle up to the bar and eat there instead of a table.  No big deal, we enjoy doing that from time to time.\u000a\u000aWe were looking over the menu, which has a ton of items to choose from, and the bartender gave us the ground rules.....it's simple.  Each person gets to order 2 Tapas, if you finish both plates you can order 2 more, it stops when you stop finishing your plate.  If you decide you want to order more food and you didn't finish your last order, you have to pay full price for the Tapas plate.....seems fair to me.\u000a\u000aSince the average price per Tapas is around $7, each person needs to order at least 3 Tapas to be "in the money".....aka "get your money's worth".\u000a\u000aI was starving, so I knew I was going to eat my money's worth.  Here's a breakdown of each round of Tapas (see pics):\u000a\u000aRound 1\u000aCrab & Artichoke Dip (Creamy Cheese, Lump Crab, 'Junk Basket' Chips)\u000aTempura Green Beans (Tempura Battered, Thai Chili Sauce)\u000aPhilly-ish (Warm Flat Iron Steak, Chipotle Mayo, Roasted Peppers, Farmstead White Cheddar)\u000aChili Dogs (Mini Pinks, Kobe Chili)\u000a\u000aRound 2\u000aSmall Balls (Creamy Risotto, Shortribs, Parmesan Fondue)\u000aJack & Coke (Kobe Beef, Sweet Whiskey Cola, Pancetta)\u000aNuttin' Honey (Battered Rock Shrimp, Honey-Walnut Glaze, Candied Walnuts)\u000aOctapussy (Tapioca Battered Calamari, Basil, Candied Orange)\u000a\u000aRound 3\u000aShorty (Braised Short Ribs, Baked Apple Chips, Sage, Savory Virgin Oil)\u000aTuscan Pizza (esto Base, Fresh Mozzarella, Marinated Tomatoes, Roasted Peppers, Balsamic Vinaigrette)\u000a\u000aEverything was excellent except the Chili Dogs (kind of plain & bland).\u000a\u000a***TIP*** - The Pizzas are pretty big for Tapas.  Order it last if you want to sample a lot of Tapas so you won't get full early in the meal.\u000a\u000aOver the course of the meal, we ordered 3 glasses of Merlot ($9 ea) and we were able to keep the bill to $72.41 plus a $15 tip, $87.41 total damage.  Not bad for a night out at the Hard Rock!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Hell yeah!  Return Factor - 100%

VSo after a disastrous lunch @ Los Antojos, I had to redeem myself.  I read a few reviews about this place and it's near my end of town, so I decided to check it out on the way home from the office.\u000a\u000aWhen I arrived there, I was shocked to see that the entire strip mall that this place is in was empty!  It was kind of Twilight Zonish creepy....I took pics, check it out....just weird.\u000a\u000aAnyway, I walked in and was pleasantly surprised to see that it was spacious....I was expecting a small joint with a couple of tables.  I think the owners are from Boston....lots of Boston sports memorabilia on the walls.....and since it was dead, 3 of the workers were changing the channel to put on the Dodgers vs Red Sox game.  Cool!\u000a\u000aI ordered the 2 Slices of Cheese Pizza special with a Bottle of Water.  Total damage was $5.15....what a deal!\u000a\u000aThe guy who took my order brought out the Pizza on paper plates.  The Pizza is thin sliced NY style Pizza.  The Pizza was pretty good.  Of course I folded it per standard MO for thin sliced Pizza.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a good experience.  I'll have to come back to try their pepperoni and veggie pizzas.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Of course!

VThis review is for the Resort's Casino, Meeting Space, and Bars.  I didn't stay in the hotel rooms.\u000a\u000aThe casino is very well designed and clean.  The poker room is huge and the slot machines are brand new.  The valet guys were very fast and cordial.  The drinks here are reasonable.....$5.25 for a pint of Blue Moon and $11 for a glass of Cabernet.\u000a\u000aThe Meeting Rooms and Banquet F&B is fantastic.  The resort is new and the meeting rooms are top of the line, comfortable, and very chic.  The walls kept the sound out and the food that we had for dinner at the conference was AMAZING!  (See pics for details.)\u000a\u000aHere's a sample of some of the food that was served:\u000a\u000a- Venison w/Jambalaya\u000a- Tempura Cactus, Brownies, Cole Slaw, Filet Mignon\u000a- Bacon Wrapped Elk w/Berries & sauce....nomilicious!\u000a- Buffalo meat in a reduction sauce w/Mushrooms....awesome!\u000a- Venison Chili & Filet\u000a\u000aThe conference was absolutely spectacular and Talking Stick Resort was a big reason it went well.\u000a\u000aI will be writing a separate review for the Black Fig restaurant and Shadows lounge.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You can bet on it!

VWas lucky to be able to come back to this place and experience the hotel....what a beautiful place!  The rooms are brand new and spectacular!  Check out the pics I posted of the room...in the meantime, here's a breakdown:\u000a\u000aBed - Damn, this bed was comfortable!  The linens were soooo soft and the pillows were just right!\u000a\u000aTV - Large flat screen LCD....perfect picture and sound.  Other benefit??  There's a docking station so you can hook up your iPod, MP3 player, Laptop, iPad or whatever to this docking station to get charged or connect it to the TV....seriously, check out my pics I posted a close up of it....1st hotel I've seen this at.\u000a\u000aFREE Wireless Internet - Enough said.\u000a\u000aSeparate shower & tub - I prefer this setup vs a shower/tub combo.\u000a\u000aRain Shower Head - I absolutely love taking a shower when it has a ceiling mounted rain shower head....check out the pics.....I want one of these in my house!\u000a\u000aPremium bath linens & toiletries - Always a nice touch and can make your stay so much better.\u000a\u000aIn-room refrigerator.\u000a\u000aIn-room premium coffee maker.\u000a\u000aYou have a choice of a view of the city of Scottsdale or the Golf Course & Mountains.  I chose the city of Scottsdale.....it was a nice view at night.\u000a\u000aOverall it was an awesome stay.  Too bad it was only for 1 night.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I hope so.....real soon.

VWhen Ken M told me about his idea to have a UYE for the Buffet of Buffets ($45.99) and do it in 1 day, I thought it was a great idea.....so I told him if he did it, I would be there.  Well, the day finally came and 7 of us embarked on a journey to accomplish this task on a Saturday in March.  I wrote a review for each buffet we went to (links to each review below).  The schedule is below:\u000a\u000aBreakfast\u000a\u000a9:00 am - Caesars Palace: Lago Buffet\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz/lago-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:ab5b7QIzLhhN_ixM5s1yrQ\u000a10:30 am - Flamingo: Paradise Garden Buffet\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz/paradise-garden-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:gBCZai1zqnPpWw-q0zyt0w\u000a\u000aLunch\u000a\u000a12:00 pm - Imperial Palace: Emperor's Buffet\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz/emperors-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:t-h1fgV4T-Lvin80jWxbPg\u000a1:30 pm - Harrah's: Flavors Buffet\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz/flavors-the-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:5mGaPZ_ukWUoVg2GttnHZA\u000a3:00 pm - Rio: Carnival World Buffet\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz/carnival-world-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:8xW8Mr61rcZ9SsJyG8uK_w\u000a\u000aDinner\u000a\u000a5:00 pm - Paris: Le Village Buffet\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz/le-village-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:m2YKMThWKZYkLXtt_0zNpA\u000a7:00 pm - Planet Hollywood: Spice Market Buffet\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz/the-spice-market-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:T3hJAv1ROUL5uVY92C2o4A\u000a\u000aI had a plan to pace myself so I could enjoy the entire day of buffets.....well, of course that plan went out the window with Buffet #1.....and it was downhill from there....I was stuffed by the time we were done with the Flamingo Buffet.  Needless to say, I gained 5.5 lbs after this ordeal.....and I'm still trying to work off the lbs in the gym.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a fun time and I recommend giving it a try at least once.  The schedule we had was perfect and we were on time for every buffet, except the last one.....but that was because there was a concert that night at Planet Hollywood and it made parking a little longer than expected.  If I was to do it again, I'd only go to 3 Buffets.....the Rio, Harrah's, and Planet Hollywood.  I'd have Dinner at the Rio & Planet Hollywood, and Lunch at Harrah's.  Those were the 3 best buffets out of the group and you can easily fit 3 of those in a 24 hour schedule.\u000a\u000aThe 7 in one day was very agressive and I won't do it again.....but I don't regret participating in the event.....all of the Yelpers in our group had a blast.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VThe latest in the Saga of Eating Challenges.....Stoney's North Forty was selected as the location for the 4 lb Omelet eating challenge.  Scheduled for a 9 AM start, I had to rush to get there in time to witness the action.  Four guys in our group of 12 were going for it.\u000a\u000aI didn't participate in the Challenge, but posted some pics of the Giant Omelette & participants.  I brought my Son along to witness the tomfoolery.  We opted to split an order of Potato Skins....yeah, I know B-O-R-I-N-G.....compared to the 4 lb Omelet, but I knew there was no way I could do it and I didn't feel like starting off my Sunday with a major stomachache.  The Skins were topped with Sour Cream, Bacon, Beef, Cheese, and Green Onions....Ranch was provided for dipping.  To wash it down, I had an Iced Tea.\u000a\u000aOur food came out pretty fast and the waitress was pretty cool to handle our huge order.  The Omelets came out first.....they are really, really BIG!  Not only is it a giant Omelet....but it's covered in Gravy, and you must eat 2 Biscuits & Hasbrowns in addition to that thing in order to complete the challenge.  Scott T gave it a valiant effort and came up a few ounces short of finishing the Omelet....seriously, check out the pic....he was soooo close, but couldn't do it.  Ken M who organized this thing did ok....respectable.....plus had ate it with a Shiner Bock....+1 for Ken for a Beer at 9 AM!\u000a\u000aOur Skins were very tasty.....the combination of toppings went well together.  The Sour Cream was drizzled over the top of the Skins instead of a blob of it that you have to put on yourself.....for some reason I prefer it drizzled over the Skins like they do it.  The Skins are very large too.....and stuffed full of the toppings....I'm glad I split it with my Son.....I was full after eating 1/2 of the order.\u000a\u000aLooking around the joint, it's a Country Western Dance Hall at night with plenty of room on the dance floor.  There's also a mechanical Bull in the corner for those who dare.....needless to say, nobody in our group was in the mood for a Bull Ride.....not after trying to house a 4 lb Omelet, ha!\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a great time....Will I return?  Yee haw!  that means "Yes" in Cowboy....I think.

VTime to update my review.  Since my last review 2 yrs ago, we've come here several times and it has improved.  It's of my Son's favorite places for Burgers.  The Cajun Fries are outstanding and the Burgers are top notch.\u000a\u000aWe also love the Coke machine that has a ton of flavors and you can create your own soft drink creation.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/five-guys-burgers-and-fries-scottsdale?select=3NnaUO95WFTGCgD4q3Ke5w#3NnaUO95WFTGCgD4q3Ke5w\u000a\u000aThe kids who work here are pretty cool too.

VWanted to search for a new restaurant in the neighborhood that I haven't tried yet and stumbled across this joint on Yelp.  Stopped by at 10:45 am and they were slow, so I could take my time figuring out what i wanted to order.\u000a\u000aThis is an unusual Sandwich Shop.  Unusual because you place an order by:\u000a\u000a1 - Selecting a Sandwich Bag, which is a brown paper bag that your Sandwich gets placed into.  Each bag corresponds to a specific type of Sandwich, ie Italian, Turkey, Veggie, etc.\u000a\u000a2 - On the bag, there are several options for you to check off.....toppings, dressing, sauce, cheese, extras, etc.  You mark off the items you want with a Sharpie Pen.\u000a\u000a3 - You had the bag over to the cashier, who charges you for the meal and then hands the bag to a crew of people who make the Sandwich per your specifications.\u000a\u000a4 - After a short wait, you get your customized Sandwich.\u000a\u000aI decided to order the #7 Italian Grinder (Salami, Pepperoni, Cappicola), on a White Roll topped with Provolone, Mayo, Mustard, Fat Free Italian Dressing, Red Onions, Lettuce, Tomato, Pepperoncini, Oil, Vinegar, Salt, Pepper, Oregano.....(see pics for full options on bag).  I got a combo meal which includes Chips & a Soda for $7.75, not a bad deal!  I grabbed a bag of Jalapeno Chips and for the drink I mixed Mello Yellow with low calorie Lemonade.....that was a mistake.  It was nasty, so I dumped it and just filled it with Mello Yellow.\u000a\u000aAfter a few minutes my Sandwich came out.  It was nice and hot....I didn't expect it to be heated, but I guess that's how it comes.  The Sandwich is wrapped in butcher paper and tin foil and cut in half for you.  I took one bite and instantly became a Fan!  It was soo good!  The Bread was awesome and the proportion of ingredients was just right.  The Meat was full of flavor and the combination of Spices, Dressing, and Mayo/Mustard added to the Sandwich.\u000a\u000aThis is a 4 Star place for me because the Value you get for the money is ridiculously good....the Sandwich by itself would have only been $5.50!  Plus there are tons of other Sandwich options ie Veggie, Bacon & Ham, Meatloaf, Spam, Caprese, and much more.  The employees were great and very helpful.  I asked them what I had to do because of their unique ordering process and they took the time to explain it to me.\u000a\u000aSide Note - While I was there, I noticed that the Duke of the Joint checked-in.....but I didn't see him anywhere.  He's either an employee who was hiding in the back or works nearby and ghost check-ins to maintain his Dukedom.....that's the 1st time I've noticed that.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  There's no doubt about it!

VOk, I'm upgrading this Sandwich joint to 5 Stars.....why?  Here's why:\u000a\u000aI stopped in for lunch and saw their recommended Sandwich of the Week.....a Nachowich (Black Bean Patty, Cheese Whiz, Salsa, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Jalapenos, Avocado)....total with tax & a bag of Chips, $7.95.  It pique'd my interest and went for it, despite not being a Vegetarian.  Of course I added a few things....Pepper Jack Cheese & Hot Pepper Mix.\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait, they called my name and out came my Nachowich.....I took one bite and was in Heaven!  Damn, that's a great Sandwich!  As I said before, I'm not a Vegetarian and unless I'm fasting, I rarely order a Veggie dish.....but took a chance on this recommendation and loved it!  It left me wanting more....I should have went for a 14" bad boy in this 'Wich!\u000a\u000aThey deserve the 1 Star bump.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Now I know where to go when I do my annual fast....you can bet on it!

VWent to Gary Canter's Deli for lunch with my wife and friends from California.  The deli is located between the Race & Sports Book  and the Poker Room.  It's kind of hard to find if you don't know where you're going.\u000a\u000aI had the Gary Canter Special, which was a huge sandwich with Pastrami, Corned Beef, Turkey, Honey Ham, Muenster Cheese on Rye Bread.  My wife had the 1/2 Corned Beef Sandwich with cup of Matzo Ball Soup.  Both came with a side order of fries.  The sandwiches were ok, not great.\u000a\u000aMy sandwich had a ton of meat on it.  I don't really like it when the meat is piled too high.  It tasted good but it didn't blow me away and leave me wanting more.  The fries were not good at all.  They tasted a bit stale and cardboard-ish.....no real flavor to them.  We tried to get chips instead of the fries but were told it would be an additional $2 for chips...what?  For a small 4 oz bag of Lay's?  Fuggetta 'bout it!\u000a\u000aMy wife enjoyed her cup of Matzo Ball Soup....again, not blown away.\u000a\u000aBecause this place is located in a casino, their prices are pretty high.  My sandwich was $13.99 and the 1/2 sandwich & cup of soup was $9.99.  Kind of high for so/so food.  Good thing my friends were paying for lunch....otherwise I would have been upset.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Probably not....unless I was starving and my friends paid for the meal.

VHow is it possible for me to not know about this place when I lived here?  Somehow it flew under my radar.  Now that I live out of state, I heard about this place from a friend and had to stop by....well, I'm glad I did!  They have some awesome pieces of jewelry here.  High quality, decent priced pieces of jewelry are in every case.\u000a\u000aBe prepared though, this is not for people looking for cheap stuff....you better come in with a bank roll or a credit card with a high limit.  If you come in here expecting super low priced items, you better do yourself a favor and stay home.\u000a\u000aWhen you arrive, you have to get buzzed into the shop.  Once you get inside, you feel like you're in a high end jewelry shop instead of a liquidation center for SuperPawn.  \u000a\u000aThe employees here are friendly and helpful too.  Now that I know about this place, it will be on my must-see list when I'm back in town.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

V***UPDATE 7/27/2010***\u000aI workout at the 24 Hour Fitness next to Chronic Tacos and came out to find Chronic Tacos flyers on the cars in the parking lot, including mine (see pics).  That's lame, taking to sleazy nightclub tactics to promote the business....blech!  One more reason not to go there for me.\u000a\u000a***ORIGINAL REVIEW***\u000aI passed by this place yesterday after having lunch at Upper Crust Pizza....it was very busy and looked cool, so I said I would try it the next day.\u000a\u000aWell....I stopped by for lunch after a workout at the gym.  It was 12:15 pm and there was a big line of about 20 people.  I decided to wait it out and see what everyone was waiting for.  While I was in line, it grew to about 30 people.\u000a\u000aThe place is decorated like a teenager's bedroom.  The walls are made of plywood and you are encouraged to tag up the walls with whatever (see pics).  I think the owners are MMA fans because there were MMA magazines all over the place and the guy who brought out my food had a MMA T-Shirt & hat.\u000a\u000aFood - I was going to try a Carne Asada burrito, but I wanted to try 2 dishes, so i opted for the Nachos (no meat) and a Carne Asada Fatty Taco.  It's a typical setup like you find at Qdoba/Zaba's/Chipotle where you order your food and you move down a line of people to add the toppings.\u000a\u000aThe Carne Asada Taco ordering process went smoothly, but the Nachos didn't....they forgot to make it as they rely on someone in the back who's not part of the assembly line to make it.  They yell out the order and I guess someone is suppose to pay attention and make it....well, they didn't.  No big deal at this point, it's only Nachos and it doesn't take a long time to make those....so, they told me when I paid that they would bring it out.\u000a\u000aI had a pretty good workout and built up a huge appetite, so I scarfed down the Carne Asada Taco while I waited for the Nachos.....it was pretty good, not great but good....nice flavor but it wasn't "authentic".  i guess growing up in SoCal makes you a Mexi-Snob when it comes to Mexican Food.\u000a\u000aAfter a few minutes my Nachos came out....I was surprised to see that there was only cheese on top of chips.  Normally at Baja Fresh/Qdoba/Chipotle/Zaba's nachos are fully loaded with all the toppings....hell, I even paid extra for guacamole.  I asked the guy who brought them about it, he apologized about the guac and said he would come back with a cup of it....but he said that's how the Nachos with no meat are prepared, with just cheese.  What a disappointment!\u000a\u000aTo make matters worse, the cheese is shredded cheese that they melt on top of the chips....that in and of itself isn't that big a deal....what was really a big deal is that the cheese wasn't fully melted, just the top of it so it didn't stick to the chips and it fell all over the place because it was still cold and shredded underneath (see pics for details).  The guacamole was bland too.  I still ate it because I was hungry.  What a bad meal....I should have went somewhere else.\u000a\u000aThe place was crowded and the majority of the people in there were younger (early 20's and teens)....I guess they like the atmosphere.  Since I don't follow MMA at all, it didn't appeal to me.....and the years of writing crap on the walls are decades behind me.\u000a\u000aI would have rated the place 2 Stars if the line was shorter...but because the hype was built up and it didn't deliver, I gave it 1 Star.  It's the 1st 1 Star joint I've rated.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Nah.....unless someone else was paying the bill.

VI travel frequently, so I'm always at the airport.  Because most of my flights are with Southwest I'm in the C Gates....and that's where Corcoran's comes into the picture.  \u000a\u000aIt's a small Irish Pub located between C Gates 1 & 2.  It's a great spot to have a few drinks and watch a game or fire up the laptop to get some work done while you wait for your flight.  If you need a plug, the table to the far left side of the bar in the left corner has a plug available.  That's the one bad thing about the place....there's not enough outlets.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Of course....this afternoon as a matter of fact.

VI was in the area and saw this place out of the corner of my eye.....then I suddenly got an urge to have some Froyo....so off I went to satisfy the urge.\u000a\u000aI quickly looked for my favorite flavore, Cookies and Cream, and then I saw Cake Batter next to it, so I decided to do a swirl.....but then, I saw Boysenberry.....dammit, I have to have it all!  I filled my cup and was about to leave.....I usually don't add toppings to my Froyo, but I saw some Captain Crunch in the toppings area and decided "why not?".  I love Captain Crunch and added some of that.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Bz8iVsCAv-8t8FsQLCXFPQ?select=9rszRRF9IS6GiWkoRiuBGA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Bz8iVsCAv-8t8FsQLCXFPQ?select=Yv9u4unKYpdGMDIMV3w6iQ\u000a\u000aI quickly went to a table so I could enjoy my Froyo treat.....yum!  It was soooo good!  Glad I did it.  All of this goodness for under $5.  Love it!\u000a\u000aThe kid working behind the counter was very friendly too.  He greeted every guest who walked into the store and said goodbye.....it sounded sincere too.  That's unusual for teenagers nowadays.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VSo when I asked Mom where she wanted to go for her Birthday, her response was....Yard House for Happy Hour 1/2 Priced Appetizers.....lol  I love my Mom, so we all went to this Yard House for her Birthday.\u000a\u000aWe took full advantage of the Happy Hour and ordered the following:\u000a\u000a- Hawaiian Poke Stack\u000a- Seared Ahi Sashimi\u000a- Chicken Lettuce Wraps\u000a- Firecracker Wings\u000a- Buffalo Wings\u000a- Pepperoni & Mushroom Pizza\u000a- Calamari\u000a\u000aAll of it was good except the Pizza.  The Better Half ordered the Pizza and waiting until the end to eat it.....but by then, it was soggy.  That's not the restaurant's fault, but our.  Next time I told her to eat it first or request it well done, lol.  Everything else was spectacular.  \u000a\u000aI had the Buffalo Wings which were good and had a nice spice level to it.....the sauce wasn't overwhelming and the wings had a good amount of meat on it.  I also sampled the Pizza, which was just ok, not great.  The Chicken Lettuce Wraps were also good but not great....I prefer the PF Changs style of lettuce versus the flimsy, leafy style of lettuce used here.....it just doesn't hold the Chicken well.  To wash all of this down, I was drinking a Chamay Tripel, which is a powerful Belgian beer.....it was very smooth with hints of Citrus & Bread....I love this beer!\u000a\u000aOur Son had the Seared Ahi & the Firecracker Wings.  He said the Ahi was Awesome.  I tried one of his Firecracker Wings.....they were pretty good, the dipping sauce was a little too sweet for my liking, but it was flavorful.\u000a\u000aMom had the Hawaiian Poke Stack.....she grew up in Hawaii and was happy to have a dish that resembled the homeland.  She was very pleased with her meal.\u000a\u000aWifey had the Pizza, which I already mentioned was soggy due to lack of attention on her part, lol.  She also had the Calamari, which she said was very good.\u000a\u000aThe service was good too even though the place was packed for Happy Hour.\u000a\u000aOverall, the family had a great night out.  We all went home happy & with full bellies.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You can bet your House on it!

VMom and I stopped by for lunch the other day.  She ordered the Hawaiian Poke Stack Appetizer ($11.65), I had the Chicken Nachos ($10.35).....the waitress convinced me to have a Stone Ruination IPA ($6.25)....kidding, I didn't need any convincing.\u000a\u000aThe food came out fast.  Mom enjoyed the Poke Stack, it's one of her favorite dishes here.  The Chicken Nachos had a lot of potential....half of the Chips tasted stale...you know, when it has the texture of Licorice....anyway, the part of my Nachos with the stale Chips were awful, the part of my Nachos with fresh Chips was awesome.  Seriously, it was night and day.  Dammit Yard House.\u000a\u000aThe Stone Ruination IPA made it all better though....yummy!\u000a\u000aOverall, it was an OK lunch.  Could have been better.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I'm sure I will.

VOk, I heard about this place from a friend on Twitter.  Their Twitter account is:\u000ahttp://twitter.com/FusionTacos\u000a\u000aIf you mention that you found them on Twitter, you will get a FREE drink with your order.\u000a\u000aFrom what my friend told me, they were a little hard to find as they are located inside a little Carniceria at the back of the strip mall on the corner of Decatur & Vegas Dr.\u000a\u000aThe place is a little hole in the wall type setup.  They offer both Mexican & Asian Teriyaki Bowl type entrees.  The fusion tacos comes in 3 types....Bul Gogi (beef), Daeji Gogi (pork), and Dak Gogi (chicken) Tacos.  I forgot about these when I got there and ordered a Carne Asada burrito & a Carne Asada taco....my son ordered the Teriyaki Chicken Bowl....go figure. (see pics)\u000a\u000aThe Carne Asada burrito was very good.  The beef was flavored nicely and the beans and rice were just the right portion....also, you can't go wrong for $3.99....that's really cheap for that quality of a burrito!  The tacos were excellent too and priced just right at $1 ea.  My son said he loved the Chicken Teri-bowl, but it was too much for him so he took 1/2 home for later.\u000a\u000aOverall this place has good value and I also like how you can get Mexican soda here....which is flavored with Natural Sugar instead of High Fructose Corn Syrup......I just can't say no to that soda!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Absolutely!

VI love BBQ and this place is located near my good friend's house.  So when he suggested we try out the new BBQ place near his house, I jumped at the opportunity.\u000a\u000aThey recently opened, so there isn't even a sign there yet....but they have a huge banner so we knew we were in the right place.  It's tucked in the corner of the shopping center, so you have to look for it.\u000a\u000aLooking at the menu, which has no beef, I was tempted by the Pulled Pork Sandwich and the Hot Links sandwich.  I couldn't decide, so I ordered both!\u000a\u000aWhile we were waiting for our food, the owner/cook gave us samples of his Baby Back Ribs, Fries, and Hot Sauce.  What a  nice guy.....the samples he gave us were awesome too.\u000a\u000aThe first dish to come out was the Pulled Pork Sandwich.....the thing is huge!  I was beginning to regret ordering 2 sandwiches...lol  Anyway, the Pork was tender and juicy and had the right amount of BBQ Sauce.  The sandwich is topped with Coleslaw, which added to the overall flavor....very good.\u000a\u000aA few minutes later came this huge Hot Links Sandwich.....I got in over my head this time....but I wasn't going to let that sandwich beat me.  The Hot Link was very good and again the right amount of BBQ Sauce was in the sandwich.  It is also topped with Grilled Onions & Cheddar Cheese.....yum.  The only thing that could have made it better was if it was spicier.....I like blazing hot Hot Links.\u000a\u000aThe staff was very friendly and helpful too...and greeted us with smiles and when we left said goodbye....nice personal touch.  I took plenty of pics, so check them out.  They also deliver....\u000a\u000aWill I come back?  Absolutely.

VInspired by the ROTD and craving their Hot Links Sandwich, I went there for lunch today with a friend who lives nearby.\u000a\u000aToday I ordered a Hot Links Sandwich, Fries, and split an order of Buffalo Wings.  Yeah, it was a belly-full alright!\u000a\u000aThe Hot Links again were very solid....loaded with Cheese, Onions, and Hot Sauce.  The Buffalo Wings were good and huge!  French Fries good as well.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant was busier this time around, so it looks like word is getting around....good, because I'd like to see them around for a while.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet your Hot Links I will!

VI've been to this park several times since moving to the Northwest part of town.  It's a nice, clean park, but the parking can get really tight on busy weekends.\u000a\u000aA friend of mine is having a BBQ here on Easter Sunday and it will be nuts.  We celebrated Easter last year here and I had to park at the Library next door.  I hope I don't have to do that this year.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VWent here for lunch with a friend.  I ordered the Nachos with no meat.  It was a pretty large serving and came topped with Cheese, Beans, Sour Cream, Guacamole, Salsa, Rice.\u000a\u000aI was surprised that they put rice on their Nachos.  I've never eaten Nachos with rice before.  It was not too bad.  I thought the rice was bland and didn't add to the flavor, but it gave an interesting texture to it.  I requested the spiciest salsa they had but it wasn't that spicy at all....I guess they make it for most Gringos.  I thought the Pinto beans were ok, but could have used a little more flavor.  The chips were not home made but were of good quality.  Overall, not bad.\u000a\u000aMy friend had a Barbacoa Pork Burrito....the portion was huge!  He liked it alot.\u000a\u000aOne cool thing they had was a large selection of Hot Sauce.  I tried a few of the really spicy ones and they packed some punch.  I'm curious about their burritos & tacos and will try them if I eat there again.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  At some point, probably....but it's not my 1st or 2nd choice.

VStopped by the Fedex Kinko's Store next door around lunchtime and was hungry for some Mexican Food.  Luckily, this Chipotle is only steps away.\u000a\u000aI went for the Steak Burrito had them put Rice, Pinto Beans, Hot Sauce, Sour Cream, and Guacamole in the Burrito.  The Burrito was solid as usual for a Chipotle.  The Guacamole & Sour Cream makes the Burrito for me.  The Rice has just the right amount of Lemon juice on it to give it that slight tart flavor.....and the Hot Sauce has a nice kick to it.\u000a\u000aI think they do a really good job because they have such a small menu and focus on providing consistent product.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet.

VCool spot to hangout after a round of golf.  It's located at the Phoenician Resort at the golf clubhouse area.  Some friends and I popped in after a round for a bite to eat and some drinks.  It was raining that day, so we camped out next to the fireplace to dry off.  We were soaking wet from playing golf all day in the rain and since it was the end of Summer, the AC was cranked on full tilt here.\u000a\u000aTo warm ourselves up we ordered a shot of premium Patron Tequila and I had a glass of Woodford Reserve Bourbon, neat.  The Tequila went down smooth and warmed me up real fast.  I savored the Bourbon and sipped it slowly while enjoying the conversation about our day of golf and other random things.\u000a\u000aFor food, we decided to order some Onion Rings ($8), Garlic Fries ($7), and Chips & Salsa w/Guacamole ($14).  We shared the appetizers.  They were very good and a perfect snack to enjoy while we hung out.\u000a\u000aOur waitress was very attentive and made sure our glasses weren't empty.  One of the guys in our group volunteered to pick up the tab because he lost a bet on the golf course....which was good because the shot of premium Patron was $45....wait, what?!\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a good time.  Next time I try the Burgers on the menu.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 87%

VWas invited to a friend's Birthday party here the other night.  They reserved an area to the left side of the bar.  I loved this place as soon as I walked in.....2 Pool Tables, 2 Dart Boards, and a full sized Shuffleboard game, plus comfy chairs and a wall of big screen TVs.....perfect!\u000a\u000aThey ordered tons of food for the party....Mozzarella Sticks, Chicken Wings, Chicken Fingers, and several Pizzas.  With over 40 people coming, they needed to load up.\u000a\u000aI tried the Mozzarella Sticks & Meat Lover's Pizza.....they were both very good.  The Mozzarella Sticks were cooked just right....the Breading was crispy and not too greasy and the Cheese was melted and gooey.....it had a nice flavor to it and went well with the Marinara Sauce.\u000a\u000aThe Meat Lover's Pizza was awesome too.....from what I could tell, it had Canadian Bacon, Bacon, Sausage, Pepperoni loaded on top of the Pie.  It was very flavorful, but with all of that Meat, the crust was a bit soft, very difficult to eat the first few bites of the slice without a fork.....which is not good for Pizza traditionalists.  Other than that, it was spectacular Pizza....full of flavor and I thought the Cheese to Meat ratio was good.\u000a\u000aTo wash all of that down, I had a Hoptoberfest Beer made by Fat Tire.....very tasty, not as Hoppy as other Beers I've had recently, but very good.  It went well with the food.\u000a\u000aOverall, I had a blast here and so did the rest of the party.  People were playing pool and darts....it was too packed to play shuffleboard as the party goers were too close to the table to play a game.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I'm considering having my Birthday Party here.

VOn my last trip to Vegas, I finally got to eat at the legendary Monta Ramen.  This place has been on my "to do" list since I lived here 3 yrs ago.  I've tried at least a dozen times to go, but because this place is so small, the wait is usually very long and I'm not patient enough to wait in a long line for Ramen.  However, this past trip we went at a great time in-between lunch/dinner when there was no wait list.\u000a\u000aI ordered:\u000a\u000aSmall Fried Rice, $3.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=w5AX4KwSXtzmxSEt-vej8g#w5AX4KwSXtzmxSEt-vej8g\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=391aM_l0lDis4oAtZPcTaw#391aM_l0lDis4oAtZPcTaw\u000a\u000aTonkotsu Shoyu Ramen, $7.25\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=cMExaL7ebqN31EuREScnlg#cMExaL7ebqN31EuREScnlg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=g152vHdE64gsXDp65vDoGg#g152vHdE64gsXDp65vDoGg\u000a\u000aMiso Ramen (no meat), $7.25\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=N4jGhfIm1nN5oyNe0EwrIQ#N4jGhfIm1nN5oyNe0EwrIQ\u000a\u000aThe portions here are much smaller than other Ramen places I've been to.  If you're accustomed to the large portions in So Cal Ramen joints, be warned that the portions here is about 3/4 those portions.  The Fried Rice was very good and hit the spot.  The Ramen was very good, full of flavor.  I had the Veggie Miso Ramen and it was awesome.  The Better Half had the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen and she thoroughly enjoyed it as well.\u000a\u000aOther notes:  They make the Ramen fresh to order, so it's a bit of a wait.  There's also counter seating available for convenience.  We sat at the counter and watched them make the dishes....pretty cool.\u000a\u000aDid it live up to the hype?  It met my expectations and was definitely 4 Stars in my opinion.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VI will use this post office every once in a while.  The location is conveniently located near my house, so I stop by when I'm out running errands.  Unless it's the holiday season, the lines usually aren't too bad and the service I've received here has been decent.\u000a\u000aI like the long drive thru drop off area in the front.  I use that 98% of the time I'm here instead of the lobby drop box.  However, if I need to use the full service windows, there's always adequate parking in the front.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VStopped here for lunch the other day and decided to order a 1/3 lb Spicy Baja Burger ( Pepper Jack, Guacamole, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Chipotle Mayo, and Fresh Jalapenos on a Chipotle Bun, $5.99), Chicago Dog ($3.99), Fried Pickles ($1.99).  Yes, I was starvin' like Marvin!\u000a\u000aThis was the first time for me at this Smashburger location.  It was around lunch-time and it was busy.  They give you a number after you order, then bring your food out to you.  I just left the gym and wasn't in a hurry, which was a good thing because it took almost 20 minutes to get my order.  The good thing about that is that the food is prepared fresh, the bad thing is that it's not convenient if you're in a hurry.\u000a\u000aThe first item I tried was the Baja Burger....yum, it was tasty!  I could taste the spicy heat from the fresh Jalapenos.  All of the ingredients gave this Burger a unique flavor to it.  I like.\u000a\u000aNext I tried a few of the Fried Pickles....yuck, they failed on this one.  The Pickles were soft and chewy.....when they're served fried like this, the breading should have a slightly crispy texture to it with the Pickle on the inside providing the soft/chewy part.  Plus they were very greasy.....all of these factors usually means the temperature on the fryer is too low.  Needless to say, I didn't finish my order.\u000a\u000aNext up was the Chicago Dog.....I like how they split the Hot Dog in half so that it holds the toppings better.  I really enjoyed the Chicago Dog....they did it right and put together a proper Chicago Dog.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a pretty good meal despite the fail on the Fried Pickles.  I didn't need the calories anyway.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Probably, but not during the lunch rush hour.

VI really like this Sports Authority.  This particular store is very clean and you can easily find what you are looking for.\u000a\u000aI came here to purchase a replacement set of workout gloves, since I lost mine a week ago.  They had a nice selection of gloves.  I was able to find the size I was looking for at a very reasonable price.\u000a\u000aI also like how well staffed it is.  There were plenty of people to help me find what I was looking for quickly.  Also, I had a few questions on shoes that were on sale and they walked me over to the other side of the store to assist me.  A+ customer service.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Absolutely!

VAfter reading about this place in a Yelp Talk Sandwich thread, I decided to meet a few friends here for lunch.  Before we arrived, I scoped out the menu to see what I would order.  The sandwiches here are not your traditional sandwiches.  There are many non-traditional options to choose from such as:\u000a\u000aBread - Kaiser, Kimmelweck, or Black Russian Swirl\u000aSides - Cold Mac n Cheese, Coleslaw, Cool Potato Salad\u000a\u000aThere are no fries or chips here friends.\u000a\u000aAfter some debate, I decided to get 2 sandwiches......\u000a\u000aThe Fatboy \u000a(Twelve hour dry rubbed brisket on Kaiser with sliced habanero pickle, mozzarella and 'fatboy' spiced mustard sauce)\u000a\u000aThe Naked Sandwich - Tri-Tip on Kimmelweck bread, Yellow Mustard, Lettuce, Tomato.\u000a\u000aOk....The Fatboy was awesome.  Very tasty!  I also enjoyed the Naked Sandwich, but I thought the Kimmelweck bread was a bit too salty.\u000a\u000aSandwiches come with a side salad, Giardiniera vegetables, and a pickle.  I thought the salads were good and the Giardiniera was awesome!  The pickle was very good too, but I had too much food so I didn't eat the 2nd pickle.\u000a\u000aAtmosphere - The place is a hole in the wall sandwich shop, so you're expectations should be very high.  Seating is limited to 3 stools inside on a counter and 2 tables outside that can accommodate 4 people each.  You're kind of screwed if you have a large group and they're busy.\u000a\u000aParking - There are 4 or 5 spots in front of the shop....parking is tough, so carpool if you can.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Absolutely!  I have my eye on a few other sandwiches already!

VI was very excited to hear that one of my favorite sandwich shops was opening a Pizza joint.  So there was no way I was going to miss out on the first day they open.  I worked out for 2 hrs in the morning in anticipation of the calories I planned to consume...ha!\u000a\u000aThe restaurant is located inside Moondoggies video poker bar.  I was pleased to see that the menu was much larger than their sandwich shop....so I went big and ordered a Slice of Cheese, Slice of Pepperoni, Slice of the Pie of the Day (Royal, see menu pics for details), and an order of 3 Chicken Fingers.\u000a\u000aThe Pizza came out first.  I tried the Cheese Slice first.  It is a thick crust.  The menu calls it Buffalo, NY Style Pizza....I've  never had this style before.  The pizza is loaded with Cheese....the crust is soft and doughy, not how I usually prefer my Pizza but it was good.  There is a good proportion of sauce.\u000a\u000aThe second slice I had was the Pepperoni.  It has the small slices of Pepperoni and the best part is that the Pepperoni is slightly burnt...+1 in my book.  Again, good proportion of sauce and cheese.  Nice zing to the Pepperoni too.\u000a\u000aThe third slice was the Royal, which was the best of the 3....no wonder it was the Pie of the Day!  Cappicola Ham, Italian Sausage, Mozzarella, and Ricotta goodness all in one Pizza Pie!!!!  The meats are very tasty and fresh....this combo went well together.  I am glad I splurged and went for it.\u000a\u000aThe last thing to come out was the Chicken Fingers....they were good, not great. The sauce was Mild and the appropriate spice level.  The fingers were not the crispy style, but the soaked chewy style.  It was ok.\u000a\u000aMoondoggies is an older bar, so don't expect a great atmosphere....it's a video poker bar and it is not in the suburbs....and hasn't been Gentrified....yet. ;-)\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet your Naked Heiney I will!!! I want to try some of the other Pies and definitely the other Subs that they don't have at their Sandwich Shop.

VAnother stop on my Pizza Bender 2011 Edition Tour, I decided to check out Broadway Pizza.  Since I was dining by myself, I opted to order 2 Slices.  Cheese Slices are $1.95 each with $.40 ea for additional toppings.  I ordered 2 Sausage & Pepperoni slices.\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait, the Pizza came out.  The slices were huge....a little bigger than what I normally see around town.  The Pizza is NY Style thin crust.  After a few bites I was underwhelmed.  The Pizza was just OK.  I didn't really care for the Sausage and the Pepperoni didn't have much flavor.\u000a\u000aOverall, the Pizza didn't leave me wanting more.  They serve other items like Wings and Calzones....maybe I'll come back to try one of those.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 40%

VOn my way to the Classic Gaming Expo at the Tropicana Hotel I decided to stop by this deli for lunch while I waited for a friend of mine to show up.  I ordered the Hot Pastrami Sandwich on Rye and a side of Fries.\u000a\u000aThe place wasn't too busy, but it took forever to get my order.....it was pretty slow.  I knocked off 1 Star for that.  The Pastrami Sandwich was very good and the Fries were a little too salty and nothing to write home about.\u000a\u000aThe prices here are pretty high, I paid $15 for a Sandwich, Fries, and a bottle of Water....ouch!  At least the Sandwich was good, otherwise I'd be a little pissed.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Maybe.

VOf all of the Banana Republics in Vegas, this one is my favorite.  It's located a few stores down from the Apple Store, which is conveniently located near the South Parking Garage.\u000a\u000aThey always have the latests styles here and I can always find my size, which is awesome.  I bought 3 pairs of jeans because they had my size.\u000a\u000aThe employees here are always friendly and they can move the line when it gets busy, which is a huge plus.\u000a\u000aWill I return?

VCame to this Ross on a mission.....to find warm gloves for an upcoming trip to China.  I've been looking for gloves for the past 2 weeks all over town and was in the area, so I stopped by this location.  It was a good thing I did.\u000a\u000aI was able to find the gloves section easily and lo and behold....found a pair that I not only liked, but were a perfect fit too!  And to score them for $9.99 made it even better.  I hate the cold and will probably never wear these gloves again....once I return from my trip, they'll end up in the donation bag.\u000a\u000aThe really bad thing about all Ross Stores is the line at the cash register....it's always a disaster.  This Ross is no different than the others, it was a mess....however the cashier was very competent and fast, so it made up for it.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I'm sure I will someday.

VOne of Kiddo's friends had a birthday party up in Anthem, which is very far from where we live.  So rather than drive back home and come back to get him, we decided to make a night out of it.  After we dropped him off at the party, we drove around and spotted this place using the Yelp app.  After browsing the menu, we decided to order:\u000a\u000aBrisket, Ribs combo platter w/Slaw & Fries, $13.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/q-to-u-bbq-anthem?select=0Eo-H7WmjYrA9e8NBjSNwQ#0Eo-H7WmjYrA9e8NBjSNwQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/q-to-u-bbq-anthem?select=bLr55BZOk48u5U-1lxyRmw#bLr55BZOk48u5U-1lxyRmw\u000a\u000aPork, Ribs combo platter w/Beans & Slaw, $13.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/q-to-u-bbq-anthem?select=ZvcXE5Yxuv6-uW9kCz6UUw#ZvcXE5Yxuv6-uW9kCz6UUw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/q-to-u-bbq-anthem?select=MeFJbGTjitF_bHYy32Qi2Q#MeFJbGTjitF_bHYy32Qi2Q\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/q-to-u-bbq-anthem?select=bhqNCX9DO_f1yd9ZsVFs4w#bhqNCX9DO_f1yd9ZsVFs4w\u000a\u000aThe joint is pretty small and we were there during the peak dinner hour, so it got packed.  Luckily we found a table.  \u000a\u000aAfter a little while the food came out.  We were starving, so it had no chance to last very long.  I had the Brisket & Ribs.  The Brisket was very good....juicy and full of smokey flavor.  The Ribs were ok, not the best I've ever had, but good.\u000a\u000aI sampled some of The Better Half's Pork....that was very good too.  The Slaw is outstanding.\u000a\u000aI think this place is family owned....everyone there was nice and accommodating.  \u000a\u000aToo bad it's in BFE, otherwise I'd eat here more often.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

VMet a colleague for lunch here this past week.  It was my first time visiting the place.  Located on the 2nd floor across from the Rave Movie Theater and opposite Cadillac Ranch, Lolita's is in a prime location of Town Square.\u000a\u000aThey serve complimentary Chips, Salsa, and Black Bean Dip.  I'm not a fan of Black Beans, but it tasted pretty good.  The Salsa could have been more spicy.  After browsing the menu for a few minutes, I decided to go for the Carne Asada Nachos ($13.99).  I asked the waitress for really spicy Salsa on the side.\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait our food came out.  The Nachos were tasty, but they were really salty!  The Carne Asada was juicy and had good flavor.....but the Salty Chips overwhelmed any of the good flavors in the dish.  The extra Spicy Salsa I requested was very hot.....perfect!  \u000a\u000aOverall, it was a pretty good meal.....but it was just average to me.  It didn't leave me wanting more.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Probably not.....unless a friend wants to meet here again.

VThis place was on my 'To Do List" for a little while. Since I was in the neighborhood I decided to stop by today.  It's kind of difficult to see from the street, so the easiest way to describe the location is that it's in the shopping mall right next to the Home Depot....on the left side if you're facing Home Depot.\u000a\u000aBefore I entered, I looked on Yelp and saw that they had a Special Offer for $1.50 for Hot Chicks.....decided I would investigate further.\u000a\u000aSince this was my 1st visit, I didn't know what a Hot Chick was and was pleased to find out that it was a Fried Chicken strip on a Hot Dog Bun w/Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, and your pick of sauce.  This sounded like a winner....so I ordered 2.....one with their BFG Sauce and the other with Honey Mustard.  For a side, I ordered Baked Mac 'n Cheese.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant is a small business owned and operated by a couple of friends and their family members.  While I waited for my food, we chatted it up a while.  They are genuinely nice people, which is a huge plus for me.  They asked each and every person who came into the joint what their first name was and called them by their first name when calling the order and saying goodbye....and it doesn't sound fake either.\u000a\u000aAfter a few minutes my food was ready.  I decided to try the Hot Chick with the BFG Sauce first.  The proportion of Lettuce/Tomato/Onions was just right and the amount of Sauce on the Sandwich was just right as well.  The Chicken was moist and tasty....it wasn't greasy (bonus)....it was like a Chicken Strip Hot Dog....awesome!  The BFG Sauce is sort of like Thousand Island Dressing, but with a slightly different flavor to it....definitely worth a try.\u000a\u000aWhile I was devouring the 1st Hot Chick, I took a few bites from the Mac 'n Cheese....it was gooey and Cheesy....it's making my mouth water just thinking about it.  The Mac 'n Cheese portion size is pretty good too for $1.50.  I then went for the 2nd Hot Chick....covered in Honey Mustard Sauce....again, it was explosion of awesome in my mouth!  The Honey Mustard wasn't too sweet and balanced the flavors of the Chicken and the other toppings.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a good day.....2 Hot Chicks & a Side of Mac 'n Cheese for around $5...isn't that every guy's dream?  Shh!!!  Don't tell my Wife!  Ha!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  There are so many other options on the menu I want to try....Grilled Chicken, Baked Chicken, and the Fries...You bet I will!

VWas in Scottsdale for an overnight trip and decided to stop by this place to have some dinner and watch the Suns vs Lakers game.  The joint is a really nice sports bar and grill....I've never been to a sports bar that was so nice before, I thought I had the wrong place when I arrived.  The restaurant is well kept and looks like it just opened, at least by the cleanliness and decor.\u000a\u000aSince I was alone, I saddled up to the bar and decided to eat and have a few Beers while I watched the game.  The menu is pretty extensive, so I asked the bartender for her recommendation.  She suggested the Boneless Wings ($7.99) or the Sliders ($7.99 + $.50 w/Cheese).....I said, "What the hell, let's go for both!".  I asked her to make sure the Boneless Wings were really Spicy.  Since I had been in China for the past 10 days I was in the mood for some heat.....she said that their hottest wing sauce wasn't that hot....but that the cooks could whip up  a Habanero Sauce for me.  I asked her to have the Boneless Wings prepared with Hot Sauce and put the Habanero Sauce on the side, just to be on the safe side, LOL.  To wash it down, I had a 22 oz SunUp Trooper IPA ($5.50).\u000a\u000aI watched the Lakers vs Suns game for a while and made some new friends at the bar while I waited for my food.  After a short wait the first dish to come out was the Boneless Wings.  The Habanero Sauce was so Hot that when they placed it down in front of me I choked on the fumes....and this was with the Sauce on the Side!  I had to move the plate off to the side, just so I could breathe....perfect!  I took one piece of Boneless Wing, dipped it into the Habanero Sauce, and took a bite....wow, it packed a big punch!  Very spicy and soooo good!  The Chicken was moist and juicy and cooked just right.....not too crunchy and not too soft....and full of flavor.\u000a\u000aThe Sliders came out a few minutes later....so I left 1/2 my Wing order to go try the Sliders.  There were 4 Sliders on the plate.  I tried it with a little Blue Cheese Dressing.....yum!  Then I dipped them in a little Blue Cheese then with the Habanero Sauce that came with the Wings....even better!  I told the bartender to tell the cooks that their Habanero Sauce was a huge hit and to thank them for me.\u000a\u000aIt took me a while, but I devoured everything I ordered.  2 IPA's later and with a Lakers' loss in the making, I asked the bartender to change up the Beer order and asked for her recommendation.  She suggested the 4 Peaks Peach Ale (22 oz $5.50)....ok, I normally don't do Peach flavored Beer but went with it anyway.  I'm glad I did, it had a nice smooth finish and you could barely taste the Peach flavor....it didn't overwhelm the brew.\u000a\u000aDespite a Lakers loss, I had a great time and meal here.  Kudos to the staff for making a patron happy by whipping up a spicy Habanero Sauce on the fly....you can almost feel the heat in the pics I took.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You bet I will!

The staff is friendly and it's a quick in/out.  It is located in a pretty good shopping center with Starbucks, Chipotle, Smiths, Golden Swirl, Sammy's Woodfired Pizza, and numerous others that make it a convenient if you're hungry or need to run errands.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  No doubt.

VDropped in with some friends.  The lanes were all taken, so we went over to the pool tables to play some pool.  They were busy too, so a couple of us went over to try and 'win' a table from people who were there.  I normally enjoy playing pool, but didn't feel like it on this particular evening.\u000a\u000aThe pool tables seemed to be in good shape and there is adequate room, but with people walking by, it can get a bit annoying to deal with them interfering with the shot.....the traffic flow can be improved.\u000a\u000aThere's a bar area with a lounge on the side of the bowling alley and the floor of the alley is eye level, so it's kind of cool to watch the bowling action from that vantage point.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a pretty cool place.  Would like to come back again.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VWent to this location to cash a check from one of my tenants.  Since the check was written from a US Bank account, I wanted to cash it at a US Bank office to make sure the funds cleared.....you never know nowadays.\u000a\u000aThe teller asked me if I was a current US Bank customer.  When I told her no, she said that there would be a $5 charge to cash the check.....What?  Since when did banks charge you to cash a check written from their Bank???\u000a\u000aI asked her what my options were.  She said:\u000a\u000a1 - You can open a US Bank account.....yeah right....I don't think so.\u000a\u000a2 - I can deposit it at a Bank where I have an account.  The funds will clear in 3 to 5 business days.  What?  No way...that's not an option....I want my money now.\u000a\u000a3 - I can pay the $5 fee and cash it right away.\u000a\u000aWell, I had no choice....I had to pay the $5 Rip-Off Fee......screw this bank.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I'm forced to because I have to cash my tenant's check here and I don't believe in passing along charges like this to my customers.  But will I ever bank with US Bank?  HELL NO!

VFor my 500th review, I thought it would be nice to review the city I've called home since '93.  We've grown up together.  I've seen it explode in the 90's, get luxurious in the early 2000's and collapse in the latter part of the 1st decade of the Millenium....now it's time to reinvent the city and start over.

VOne of our favorite places when we lived in Vegas, we always drop in when we go back to the old neighborhood.  We're pleased that they still have our favorite items on the menu:\u000a\u000aBruschetta, $7\u000a\u000aPasta Fagioli, $8\u000a\u000aMozzarella alla Caprese, $10\u000a\u000aGnocchi di Ricotta, $15\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salvatores-las-vegas?select=h0VmLNoc0DnQ3youXGdGxA#h0VmLNoc0DnQ3youXGdGxA\u000a\u000aSpaghetti w/Meatballs, $16\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salvatores-las-vegas?select=IpQejeEhxhX-VW3kmGhoQg#IpQejeEhxhX-VW3kmGhoQg\u000a\u000aMy personal favorite is the Gnocchi of course.  I always get it, either as an appetizer/side or an entree.  This past visit was no different.  I got it as a side dish and had the Spaghetti and Meatballs for my entree.  Both were awesome.  The Better Half and I split the Mozzarella alla Caprese for our appetizer, which was perfect.\u000a\u000aService here is very good.  There are a couple of servers that we remember and they stopped by our booth to say hello.  We miss this place.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 85%

VThis is Phoenix's attempt to build up a nightlife area downtown.  In my opinion I've seen better.  Here's why:\u000a\u000aPros\u000a+ Yes, there's some variety of restaurants/bars....Tilted Kilt, Arrogant Butcher, Copper Blues, Jimmy John's, Lucky Strikes.\u000a\u000a+ It's located near US Airways Center and Chase Field.  Great for pre/post-game partying.\u000a\u000a+ For the most part, it's kept clean.\u000a\u000a+ The Palomar Hotel is pretty cool.\u000a\u000aCons\u000a- Besides game nights or concert nights, this place is D-E-A-D....a ghost town.  The only people here on those nights are the handful of residents from downtown, and they're no fun at all.\u000a\u000a- Parking sucks.  You can park in one of the underground parking structures or hotels nearby valet, which are expensive.....or the surface street parking lots, which are unsafe with no attendants.\u000a\u000a- Panhandlers will hit you up for money as you walk around.\u000a\u000aIn most cities, the downtown area is a destination for nightlife and fun.  In this case, it's only a destination when there's a special event nearby.  We've stopped coming here on off-nights because it was a waste of time each time we did.  Oh well, maybe someday it will become something better.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 30%

VI stayed at Green Valley Ranch for a few days and every morning stopped by this location to get a Smoothie to start the day.  It's conveniently located in the food court near the conference rooms, so instead of Coffee, I got a Smoothie to start my day.  \u000a\u000aMy Smoothie of choice is the Rockin' Raspberry (Raspberries, Strawberries, Banana, w/shot of Whey Protein), $5.99.  It's very tasty and serves as a sort of meal replacement instead of eating a Pastry or Muffin before our conference sessions.\u000a\u000aThe employees here are friendly and from the 2nd day of my stay started making it for me as soon as they saw me in line....that's great service!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VI was in the area and decided to stop by after reading @jOanne & @keith's reviews.\u000a\u000aGood thing I read the reviews first because I walked in and immediately saw the large kitchen counter where you order....there are 3 ordering stations where you order directly from the cooks.  Since I already knew about it, I walked up like I knew what I was doing....until they started speaking to me in Spanish.....then I got a little flustered.\u000a\u000aThe menu is very simple....there are only a few things you can order and it's printed in large letters above the kitchen counter (see pics).  I decided I wanted to try the Chorizo Taco & Carne Asada Taco....and then curiosity got the best of me and I went for an order of Carne Asada Fries....they are $10 while the Tacos are $2....what does $8 more get you?  I was about to find out.  I threw $2 in a tip jar on the counter in front of the cooks and waited patiently for my order.\u000a\u000aThe food is homemade and made from scratch right in front of you....including the Tortillas.  You have to grab a tray and wait for your cook to make your order because they hand it to you right after they make it.  From there, you pay at a register on the other side of the room by the door....kind of like a Cafeteria in a Hospital or Convention Center.\u000a\u000aMy cook made me the two Tacos first and told me that he'd call my name for the Carne Asada Fries.  He asked me if I wanted everything on the Tacos...I said yes even though I had no clue what that meant....after I got the Tacos, I realized that it meant Onions, Cilantro, Guacamole, and Salsa....perfect!\u000a\u000aI jumped right into the Chorizo Taco first....it was pretty good.  Good proportions on the toppings and the size of the Taco was decent, worth $2.  Next was the Carne Asada Taco....but before I could take a bite, the cook called my name for the Fries....when I picked it up I knew I was in trouble....the damn order of Fries was huge!  It must have weighed at least 3 to 4 lbs!  Seriously!  (see pics)\u000a\u000aI finished off the Carne Asada Taco...which was pretty good.  The meat was fresh and cooked perfectly....it wasn't overcooked and didn't have too much fat on it.\u000a\u000aThen I looked at the beast called Carne Asada Fries....no wonder this damn thing is $10....it can feed 4 people!  I knew there was no way I could finish it and felt bad because I was going to waste a lot of it.  I grabbed my fork and attacked it.....basically, it's French Fries (think McDonald's sized cuts) covered in Cheese, Guacamole, Carne Asada, Sour Cream, & some other kind of Cream.  The Fries were cooked just right....not too soft, not overcooked.  The flavor of the dish was awesome.\u000a\u000aI gave it my best shot, but could barely finish just under 1/2 of the plate (see pics)....great value though....could easily feed 4 normal sized human beings.\u000a\u000aThe only gripe I had about the joint was a lack of a Salsa Bar....or Hot Sauce.....I would have loved to pour some on my food, but had to do without...that's what kept me from giving them 5 Stars.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Yep!  Next time, I'm bringing backup to help me with the Fries!

VWas here during CES to attend a Tweetup hosted by CES and the Hilton.  This place was formerly a casino that was the entrance to the old Star Trek Experience.  Now, 75% of it has been turned into a lounge with sofas, chairs, and a small stage.\u000a\u000aWith over 1,200 people expected to attend this event, I saddled up early to the bar.  It was open bar from 4-7 pm!  Awesome!\u000a\u000aWhile I was at the bar, I met a sales guy from a startup company in Silicon Valley.  He told me about his product and company.....interesting concept, I hope they make it.  After that, I walked around to meet some friends and make some new ones.  It was good times.....amazing what free alcohol can do for a vibe right?  ha!\u000a\u000aA DJ was playing music and giving away prizes during the event.\u000a\u000aThis is a nice venue to hold a party like this.  Good stuff.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  When's the next open bar?

VWhile attending a conference at the Talking Stick Resort, I noticed a sign for a Scotch tasting event that was held at Shadows Bar/Lounge.  For $10....I had to check it out.\u000a\u000aShadows is a lounge hidden in a corner next to the High Limit Room.  When you walk in, there is a small bar on the right and indoor/outdoor lounge seating on the left.\u000a\u000aThey setup the Scotch tasting in the center of the room and I paid my $10 and went for it.  Here's the lineup of Scotch they had for you:\u000a\u000aDalwhinnie 15 yr\u000aGlenkinchie 12 yr\u000aCragganmore 12 yr\u000aOban 14 yr\u000aTalisker 10 yr\u000aLagavulin 16 yr\u000a\u000aYes, you got all 6 of those for $10!!!

VDropped in for a lunch one day and decided to order a #1 Sandwich (Ham, Salami, Provolone, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions, Dressing) w/Pasta Salad and a Coors Light.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tpGr6-jVv_dFSnDGcVL3rw?select=gI5V2uJFJoVdCc6CMlojqA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tpGr6-jVv_dFSnDGcVL3rw?select=MyzQ7VsZ8W4vxMXJxyyERw\u000aoUB0n2Jl76BxGXDUpj3BgQ\u000a\u000aSince I was dining alone, I sat at the counter.  The food was prepared pretty fast.  I only had a few sips of my Beer before the waitress came out with the Sandwich.  I took one bite and instantly became a fan.  The Bread is soft and crunchy....the crunch comes from the toaster.  The Sandwich is served hot from a toaster....which makes the flavor of the Meats come out.  The only complaint I have about the Sandwich is that the Dressing makes the Bread too soggy....if you don't eat it fast, it will fall apart on you.\u000a\u000aThe Pasta Salad is OK....too much Cheese and Dressing on it...I would have preferred it with a little less.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a nice lunch experience.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 84%

VOk....so I was hungry one night and decided to order some Papa John's Pizza online.  I've done it before 100's of times....but it has been several years since the last time I ordered from PJ's online.  I ordered a large Sausage & Pepperoni Pizza.\u000a\u000aThe Pizza was delivered in a timely manner....however, after the guy left and I opened the box in the kitchen, I saw that it was only a CHEESE Pizza!  Dammit!\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AoKRsxts46M2bCIqBukirg?select=t06CHUYESOoosWqYRkj7ew\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AoKRsxts46M2bCIqBukirg?select=ScT-S7CASvjOnb_pO3BUdw\u000a\u000aSo disappointed!  I called them to tell them about it and they said that the order shows it was a Cheese Pizza and that they've been having a lot of problems with their new website with this type of issue.....did they offer a discount for a future order?  NO.....how about a replacement Pizza?  NO....what the hell?\u000a\u000aI was starving, so I begrudgingly ate the Cheese Pizza....and you know, it tasted "bitter".....\u000a\u000aNext time I will order via the phone, if I call this location again....IF.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 10%

VI love BBQ and I'm always looking for a new BBQ joint to try.  Thanks to @keith I found this place.  I stopped by for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and was shocked that the place was dead.  Located inside Lucky's Lounge, a video poker bar, I expected it to be packed with people watching football....but it was not the case.  There were only 2 people in the restaurant and a handful at the bar.\u000a\u000aI decided to eat in the restaurant and sat at a table facing the TVs so I could watch the Chargers game while eating.  After looking over the menu, I decided I wanted to try the Hot Links Sandwich & the Beef Brisket Sandwich.  Both came with sides, but I didn't really want to have 2 sides and asked if I could get just the sandwich.  The server said no, so I ordered the Slaw and Sweet Potato Fries.  I almost got the Beans, but backed off.  To wash it down, i ordered Raspberry Iced Tea.\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait, the food came out.  Since I inquired about the Beans, the server brought out a small sample with my order....that was awesome of her.  I decided to give it a try before I ate the rest of my meal.....the Beans were delicious!  They were very tasty and not too sweet....instead of Bacon, they use some of the BBQ Pulled Pork to simmer in with the Beans...you can taste the Pork and I was beginning to think I should have ordered it instead of the Fries.\u000a\u000aI went after the Hot Links Sandwich next....there is no BBQ Sauce in the Sandwich, so you have to add it yourself.  I asked my server if they had a Spicy BBQ Sauce and she said yes and provided me a little cup of both the Regular BBQ and Hot BBQ Sauces.  I put a little of the Hot BBQ Sauce with the first bite....yum, it was pretty good, but not too Spicy.  I would rate the kick as Mild for both the Hot Links & the Hot BBQ Sauce.  I then tried it with the Regular BBQ Sauce...it was good too.  The Sauce is not too sweet....which is how I like it.\u000a\u000aNext up was the BBQ Beef Brisket Sandwich.  I decided to put my Slaw in my Sandwich as a topping....and added some of the Hot BBQ Sauce to it.  Again, the Sandwich comes dry, so you have to add Sauce if you want that flavor.  I recommend adding the Sauce.....after the first bite I knew I was in heaven!  The Beef was moist and juicy and full of Smokey BBQ Flavor!  The Slaw & Sauce only added to the experience....I didn't want the Sandwich to end!\u000a\u000aI had a few of the Sweet Potato Fries, which were just ok....they were are little bland.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a good meal....I preferred the Beef Brisket over the Hot Links.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Hell yeah!  I want to try the Ribs next time and there are two interesting pseudo-BBQ Sandwiches that I want to try.

VWas on the way home and remembered to finally stop by this joint and take it off my "To Do List".....thank God I did!  It was 10:45 am and I wondered if they would be open.....they were, lucky me!\u000a\u000aI was greeted by the owner and his Wife.....at least it appeared as if they owned the joint.  They were very friendly and welcoming.  It's a casual restaurant with 10 or 12 tables inside and 8-10 counter seats near the grill.  There's also a few tables outside with umbrellas if you like to dine outdoors.\u000a\u000aI browsed the menu and was getting excited with every item I saw.....Vienna Beef Dogs, Beef Sandwiches, Iltaco Pizza Puffs......WAIT, Pizza Puffs?!  Holy $hit, that changes everything....I love those things!\u000a\u000aI couldn't control myself, so I ordered a #2 Two Chicago Dogs w/Relish, Pickle Spear, Tomato, Hot Peppers, Mustard, Onions, Seasoned Salt....and Fries ($6.00)....plus I ordered a Pizza Puff ($3.50) and washed it down with a bottle of Coke Zero.  Dammit, there goes the diet!  The lady asked for my name and asked if I was dining in or taking out....I told her dine-in.\u000a\u000aI saddled up to a table and anxiously waited for the food.  While I was waiting I noticed a man with his Son sitting at the counter.  They were eating Chicago Dogs and he was telling his Son how a Chicago Dog is made and how it should taste....the owner, who was grilling it up was there telling the kid about how to make the Dog....it was awesome.\u000a\u000aAfter a few minutes my order was ready.  The lady brought it out to my table....I unwrapped both Dogs and the bag of Fries and put them together on one wrap so I could eat it uninterrupted.  She told me the Pizza Puff was still cooking so it would be a few minutes....that's pretty standard to wait for Pizza Puffs, so I didn't care.  The Dogs were covered in Mustard, which is how I like it.....if you don't like too much Mustard on your Dog, I suggest you tell them ahead of time.  The first bite was an explosion of Awesome on my taste buds....it was sooo good!  The Vienna Beef Dog was full of flavor and the combination of toppings was just how I remember the Dogs in Chi-town.  The Relish is the atomic green colored stuff you find in Chi-town.  This place is legit!\u000a\u000aThe Fries were piping hot and seasoned with a Salty seasoning....if you don't like your Fries too Salty, then I suggest you either ask for them plain or tell them easy on the seasoning.  I liked it.  It complimented the Dogs just right.  The Dogs were average size.....not too big, do don't expect a 1/4 lb Dog with the #2.  I think they offer larger Dogs with other combo meals, but not with the #2.\u000a\u000aThe Pizza Puff came out shortly after I started eating.  I waited until I was done with the Dogs before I moved over to that bad boy.  It was wrapped in the traditional Iltaco Pizza Puff wrapper.....those of you familiar with Pizza Puffs know what I'm talking about.  I bit into the greasy, flaky, doughy Crust and mmmm.....yeah, it's the Pizza Puff that I've grown to love.  Inside of the flaky, doughy Crust is a filling of Pizza Sauce, Sausage, and Cheese.  Dammit, these things are addicting and I just discovered this place....I have a feeling I will be here often.\u000a\u000aThe owners were very attentive and asked if I was ok and needed anything.  After I was finished, they asked how I liked it....I gave them the thumbs up and a big smile.  They were smiling too and said "See you soon Peter!"......I love family owned businesses who pay attention to their customers.  While I was there 6 or 7 people came in and they knew all of them by first name.  I hope I get to know them better too.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  This place has won my clogged artery Heart....you bet I will!  Now, back to the gym to burn off these calories.

It was a "4 Cheese" Pizza and each of the 4 sections of the Pizza had the different Cheeses...they weren't blended.  Each section was bland.  I was really disappointed.\u000a\u000aThe Ravioli was good, but not great.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a very average lunch....and for the price, it should've been outstanding.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 30%

VOn my last trip to Vegas we dined here to celebrate a friend's birthday.  When we lived in Vegas, we would dine here 2 or 3 times a year.  It was nice to come back to experience it again.  We love the views here and got lucky with a table next to the window.  Situated in Summerlin, which is about 10 miles NW of the Strip, you have a great view of the city from here.\u000a\u000aI couldn't wait to order my favorite items on the menu...which they still had:\u000a\u000aWedge Salad (Romaine Lettuce, Maytag Bleu Cheese Dressing, Bacon, Cherry Tomatoes), $8\u000a\u000a12 oz Filet, $38\u000a\u000aSide of Potatoes Au Gratin, $7\u000a\u000aThe Lettuce on the Salad was nice and fresh...very crisp and juicy, just the way I like it.  I like my Filet cooked between Medium and Medium Well...not too well done....they hit the mark, it was perfect.  The side of Potatoes Au Gratin was good, very large portion though....enough for 2 people.\u000a\u000aWe had a great server who took very good care of us.  Our glasses of Wine were never empty....that's the way it should be.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a nice place to have a good Steak with friends.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

I still can't get away from my #9 Italian Club w/Hot Peppers.  They make the Sandwiches very fast here, so during the lunch hour rush the line moves fast.

VIf you haven't tailgated at Sam Boyd Stadium, I suggest you give it a try.  This is really a much different event than attending a game in the Stadium as you don't have to have game or event tickets to party in the Tailgate lot.  I attended the Tailgate party for the UNLV vs UNR game last night and it was awesome. (some pics posted)\u000a\u000aThere is a separate Tailgate lot on the left side of the Stadium when you enter in from Russell Road.  The Tailgate section is a grass field where you can park your vehicles and setup your Tailgate party in a section that you can reserve.  You can reserve your spot for the season or you can reserve a spot for a single event or game.\u000a\u000aThe field is well kept and the grass is perfect for providing a cool area to do your pre-game partying.  Grills, tables, and tents are allowed.  The area we were partying in was near section F10 and had easy access to the Stadium once the Tailgating was over.\u000a\u000aOn this particular evening, there were literally tens of thousands of people having a good time.  Of course Metro and Campus Police were present to make sure everybody partied in peace....but they didn't get in the way and were very cool.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I will try to make it to every Tailgate Party I can!

VStopped by to grab some lunch with my Mom the other day.  I've read many of the Yelp reviews raving about the Red Velvet Pancakes and had to experience this for myself.  Based on the familiar items of SPAM, Portuguese Sausage, and other island style dishes....I'm guessing that the owners are from the Pacific Islands.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Short Stack Red Velvet Pancakes (Topped with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles. Served with cream cheese syrup. $5.25), which are 3 Pancakes about 8 inches in diameter each.....and a side order of Portuguese Sausage.  Mom ordered the Jalapeno Burger ($8.75).\u000a\u000aThe food came out in short order and I eagerly started on my Red Velvet Pancakes......they were freakin' AWESOME!  Wow, I was blown away with the Sweet, Soft, Velvety flavor and texture.  I should have ordered a full order dammit.\u000a\u000aI then took a few bites of the Portuguese Sausage.....it was disappointing.  I didn't enjoy the flavor of it at all and it didn't taste like the Portuguese Sausage I was accustomed to eating when I'm in Hawaii.  Bummer.\u000a\u000aMom couldn't finish her Jalapeno Burger, so she gave me a few bites.  I thought it was OK, nothing special.  Certainly not worth $8.75.\u000a\u000aOur server was friendly and on top of things.  Overall, a nice breakfast experience.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Those Red Velvet Pancakes are calling me.....

VSaw @ashley B's review and was reminded that this joint just opened on Saturday.  Decided to stop by for dinner and grab a quick bite.\u000a\u000aThe place is casual dining with 20 or so tables.  You order at the counter and they call your name when your Sub is ready.  After browsing the menu decided on an Italian Sub (Italian Sub - Genoa Salami, Pepperoni, Ham, Provolone Cheese and Italian Dressing sprinkled with Italian Seasonings) $5.59.....with a bag of Chips and a bottle of Water.  Total damage $8.42.\u000a\u000aThe girl who took my order was very new and took a while to take the order, but she had a huge smile on her face and was very friendly.....how could I not like this place so far?\u000a\u000aThere were a lot of employees working/getting trained.  My food took around 15 minutes to be prepared.....an employee apologized to me and told me they made my Sandwich wrong the first time, so they had to make a second one.  A) I'm impressed that they cared enough to make it right...some places won't.  B) I'm impressed that an employee cared enough to come and tell me about it rather than have me wait around wondering what happened.\u000a\u000aAfter I finally got my Sandwich, I took a few pics and couldn't wait to dive in.....it looked soo good.  After I took my 1st bite, I fell in love with it.....the combination of Meat, melted Cheese, and Italian Dressing/Seasoning made this Sub taste so good with the toasted Italian Roll.  The Jalapeno Chips went well with the Sandwich too.\u000a\u000aDespite the hiccups because of the new employees, it was a great experience.  They've only been open 3 days and I really like the attitude of the employees.  I hope they make it.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  You can bet on it!

VCouldn't resist coming back here to try more of their Subs.  Last visit, I got an Italian Sub.  This visit, I got a New York Steamer (Pastrami, Corned Beef, and Monterrey Jack Cheese) w/Jalapeno Chips and a Soda.....yeah, I normally don't get Soda, but they have Coke Zero on the fountain here....so I caved, damn!\u000a\u000aAs I was waiting for my food, I noticed a huge selection of Hot Sauce! (see pics)  How did I miss that last time?  Seriously, I think I'm in Heaven!  They even have 3 different flavors of one of my favorite Hot Sauce companies (Melinda's)!\u000a\u000aOf course, I picked two bottles of Melinda's and waited patiently for my food.  After a few minutes, it was ready.  For the first bite of the NY Steamer, I didn't add Hot Sauce because I wanted to try it in it's traditional style.....it was friggin' awesome!  The Pastrami & Corned Beef were juicy and the melted, gooey Monterrey Jack went well with the Meat....of course the Bread was awesome too.  The next few bites, I added Melinda's Habanero & Chipotle Hot Sauce.....wow, it made it even better!  Then I tried the Melinda's Jalapeno Hot Sauce....good, but not as good as the Chipotle.\u000a\u000aI devoured that Sandwich like it was my last meal on Earth!  What a great experience.....that combined with the serious Hot Sauce collection elevated this joint to 5 Stars for me.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  I'm already thinking about it!

VStopped here to watch the Cowboys game. They have a basic selection of beer, not much in terms of craft beer...no IPAs, bummer.\u000a\u000aThere's an area that has comfy, pillowy chairs and a sofa that faces a wall of 5 TVs...great for watching the games.  There's a pool table in the back room and a rear door for smokers to have easy access outside.\u000a\u000aOverall, its a decent neighborhood bar.  However, the bartender didn't bother to tell me about the $1.50 beer specials during the football games....I ordered a Newcastle for $3.75 and not really complaining, but I always like to know my options.\u000a\u000aWill I return? I hear they have drink specials during the week, so probably.

VConveniently located on the way to my Son's school, I stop by here on occasion in the morning to grab a cup of Joe.  I am simple and enjoy a half-caf Americano Grande.  I normally use the drive-thru here, but will go inside if the line is too long.\u000a\u000aThe staff here is friendly and always get my order right.  That's all I ask for at this Starbucks location.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Yeppers.

VStopped by this evening to attend a Tweetup at this joint.  My friend was hosting the Tweetup and I love Pizza, so why not?  I'm glad I made it!\u000a\u000aThere was a special buffet of food setup just for the event.  Salad, Chicken Wings, Baked Ziti, and of course Pizza!  The Pizzas that were available were Pepperoni, Meat Lovers, Chicken & Artichoke, and Cheese.  I ate a slice of every Pizza, a little Salad, about a dozen Wings, and a small portion of Baked Ziti.  I wasn't planning on eating that much...I swear....but the food was sooo good and the owner, Biaggio, came out and insisted that we try everything!  How could I say no?\u000a\u000aThe Pizza is NY style thin crust.....and damn it's awesome.  It folds just right and the proportion of Cheese and Sauce is perfect.  The Meat on the Meat Lover's Pizza is something else too....I don't know if I could ever be a Vegetarian.  I suggest eating the Pizza fresh as the slices can get greasy fast...especially with the Meat Lovers.\u000a\u000aThe Wings were served plain with the Hot Sauce and Dipping Sauces on the side.  Biaggio told us that the Salad Dressing/Dipping Sauces are all made from scratch in the kitchen.  The Bleu Cheese dressing was awesome....didn't have any of the others.  The Wings are battered and were cooked just right....not too greasy, which is how I like them.\u000a\u000aThe Salad was ok....I didn't have much of it though because I ate so much of everything else.  The Baked Ziti was great too.....the Cheese was gooey and full of flavor.\u000a\u000aAfter I was done eating, Biaggo brought out Fried Dough sprinkled with Sugar & Chocolate....I had to have a bite....yum!  Then he brought out a cake for his Son's Birthday....what, more food?!  I took a couple of slices home....I couldn't eat any more.\u000a\u000aOverall, the event was fun and the food was plentiful and awesome.\u000a\u000aI spied the menu and saw that they serve Breakfast too.....I don't know how I'm going to lose any weight with this place in existence!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Are you kidding me?!  I want to try Breakfast and their Subs, and a bunch of other things on their menu....of course I'll be back!

VTook my Son here for lunch last week.  It was his first experience at Biaggio's Pizza.  We ordered a Large Meatlover's Pizza (see pics).  We patiently waited for it to be prepared and sat in the dining area and chatted with Biaggio for a few minutes.  He's a really nice guy who enjoys his business.\u000a\u000aOur Pizza came out after a short wait and we devoured it within minutes.  It is as good as I remembered!  My Son couldn't stop talking about it.  I wish we lived nearby so we could come more often.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's one of the best Pizza joints in town.  Return Factor - 99%

VStopped in here to grab a Beer while I waited for my flight out of Gate B-19.  It's a medium sized bar with around 14 seats and a dining area that seats around 50 people.  It's located near the B Gates where it splits into a fork.\u000a\u000aI ordered a giant (see pics) 32 oz Stella ($10.99)....not a bad price for an Airport Bar, right?  How could I resist?  It's going to be a nice plan ride to San Diego.....ha!\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Next time I depart out of the B Gates, you know where you'll find me!

VAfter having a couple of drinks at Andreoli's, which is on the other side of the parking lot, I dropped in here for a couple of more.  I've seen this place driving on the 101 hundreds of times and have never stopped by, until now.  I'm glad I did.\u000a\u000aI ran into an old friend and he was drinking a can of Old Style!  Wait, what...?!  I haven't had Old Style since my last trip to Chicago in 2005, wow!  So I got one and it was only $2.75...ha!\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tavern-grille-scottsdale-scottsdale?select=8wMbT533TTkCipGpgHC76A#8wMbT533TTkCipGpgHC76A\u000a\u000aLooking around the joint, I noticed a pool table and an OTB (Off Track Betting) window.  You can bet on the Ponies here, awesome!\u000a\u000aI wasn't here to eat, so I didn't try any of the food.  However, it smelled good and the plates that came out looked delish...I will have to return to try it out.\u000a\u000aThe bartenders here are very friendly and ensure that you're never empty handed.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

VI read about this new attraction in the Las Vegas Sun and decided to make a trip down to Fremont Street to give it a try.  Since my Son was off of school today, I brought him along.  The attraction is located on the far East side of Fremont Street, which is closest to Las Vegas Blvd.  The best place to park is the parking garage on the corner of Fremont Street & Las Vegas Blvd.  It's pretty cheap for parking....we were there for 2 hours and paid $3.\u000a\u000aI posted a video on YouTube if you want to see the experience:\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxzOl3TXeJs\u000a\u000aThe ticket office for this attraction is on the Fremont Street level next to the Walgreens.  Tickets are $15 each for 1 ride, $25 for 2 rides, $30 for 3 rides....that's per person.  In other words, 3 people riding once will pay $45 total.....capiche?  Cool....\u000a\u000aSince we didn't know if we'd enjoy it, we paid $15 each for the single ride.  We should have paid $30 each for the 3 pack.....because we ended up riding a 2nd time.  The girl was cool and only charged us $10 each for the 2nd ride as if we paid for the 2 pack....not sure she'll hook you up like that though, so don't expect that.  (see pics for full price list and all day discount pricing)\u000a\u000aThe launch pad is I think 60 ft in the air and you access it by going to the 5th floor (roof) of the parking garage, which is the same building the ticket office is located.  We made our way up there and waited in line.  Everyone in line was pretty nervous, including myself.  I'm not a fan of heights, but wanted to give this a try.  My Son was pretty brave....he wasn't nervous at all....until we got up to the edge of the platform.\u000a\u000aYou get strapped into a harness and get some instruction.  Here are some tips:\u000a\u000a- Don't wear flip flops or sandals with no ankle straps....if you do, they'll make you take them off and put them in a netted bag.\u000a\u000a- Purses or bags without secure straps will not be allowed on the ride.\u000a\u000a- Don't wear anything with loose pockets or if you do, don't put anything in them because it could fly out easily.\u000a\u000a- Don't wear loose sunglasses.  They could fly of easily with the airflow generated during the ride.\u000a\u000a- They don't allow pictures to be taken during the ride, for obvious reasons...ie your camera could slip out of your hands and seriously injure someone on the ground.\u000a\u000aIt sounds like a lot of rules, but it's common sense.  Knowing this in advance will save you a trip back to your car or hotel room.\u000a\u000aThe zipline can handle groups up to 4 people at one time.  A quick hint if you want to get on/off the ride fast.....ride as a single.  They're always looking for a single to fill up a group of three, which happened often while we were there.\u000a\u000aWe were nervous on the final walk up the stairs to the launch pad....when you get up there the instructor will attach you to a cable until you're secured on the zipline.  Each person will be hooked up to the zipline and given instructions on what to do.  I admit, I was nervous all the way up until the launch of our 1st ride.  It looks much higher from the launch pad than from the ground.\u000a\u000aAfter everyone is given instructions, he releases the safety clip and you lift up your legs and your body weight launches you down the zipline.  If you want to go really fast, tuck your knees up to your chest like a cannon ball dive in a pool.....you'll pick up speed right away.  If you stay in this position, you'll maximize your speed all the way through the ride.....this was a tip given to us by the instructor.\u000a\u000aThe ride itself is very fun.....you feel like you're flying above everyone, because you are.  It was very exhilarating and I felt free.  The landing is the roughest part.....you slam into a padded stopping mechanism and your momentum swings you up quickly while an employee secures your line with a rope.  I was amazed at how fast we came in on the landing.....the 2nd time around I nailed the employee in the shoulder with my knee....I'm surprised he didn't go down.  He said it happens all day long.....I wouldn't want his job.\u000a\u000aAfter your ride, you get your picture taken and you have the option to purchase pictures of your ride.....prices are $10 each for the 1st 2 pics, then $5 a pic after that.  I paid for 4 pics since we couldn't take any on the ride itself.....nice to have as a souvenir for the 1st time, won't pay for it again though.  I didn't post those pics because I don't have a scanner.  The pics I posted of people on the zipline were other riders.  The pics from the launch pad was from my perspective....I put the camera away just before launch.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was an exhilarating ride and we had a blast.\u000a\u000aWill we return?  There's no doubt about it.....I'm taking all of my friends who visit from out of town to ride.

VWas doing some last minute Halloween shopping for my Son.  He was looking for a specific mask that all of the kids are supposedly going to wear for Halloween and this was our 2nd stop.\u000a\u000aI've never been in a Spirit Halloween Store before and I was really impressed with it.  It had a ton of Halloween related products.....costumes, decorations, table clothes, utensils, you name it!  There are a ton of cool displays too (see pics).....it gives you some ideas of how you could setup your house for Halloween.  Too late for this year, but I might do something next year.\u000a\u000aMy Son found his mask within 5 minutes...score!  Saved me a day of Halloween Store hopping and a tank of gas.\u000a\u000aRandom notes - Everything in the store will be 50% off starting Nov 1st.  The women employees here were dressed very provocatively....was beginning to think I walked into a Strip Club, wonder if it's like that at all locations or just this one?\u000a\u000aOverall Value - Great.\u000aWill I return?  You can count on it.

VDropped by for lunch recently.  The restaurant is one of those 'Tweener' places that's not quite fast food, not quite sit down.  You order at a counter and they bring the food out to you.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HshPHJ-OJ0rpVR-okV55Rg?select=DfsU-CsIddif5KvRj2aeQA\u000a\u000aAfter browsing the menu, decided to go with the Carne Asada Burro (Steak, Beans, Rice and Pico de Avocado, $4.95).  It comes with complimentary Chips & Salsa and you can refill your Chips.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HshPHJ-OJ0rpVR-okV55Rg?select=NHAjUA3KMYUy-V8y5i1myA\u000a\u000aThey have a bottle of Hot Salsa on the table for you to use.

VThis gas station is virtually invisible at night.  Unless you live in the area and know where it's located, you'll never find it driving down Pima Rd.  We were on fumes and needed gas desperately.  Thank God for Google Maps...it told us that this place was less than a block away.  I didn't see it until we were right up on it.  I guess the area residents don't like large, well-lit signs....\u000a\u000aThe lanes are wide here, but the gas isn't cheap.  But what do you expect for a gas station in the middle of nowhere?  It's your only choice.\u000a\u000aThere's a general store available here as well, but we didn't have a need for anything in there.  The pumps are well lit at night, so we felt safe.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 75%

VWas looking for a Mexican joint on Yelp and stumbled across this place.  Since I was dining solo, I saddled up to the bar to grab some dinner.  I'm so glad I did.....here's why:\u000a\u000a+ The Cheese Enchiladas rock!  Priced at $14, they're not cheap, but they're damn good!  They have 2 sauces on them....Green and Red....they each have a distinct taste that make the dish explode with flavor in your mouth.  Awesome!\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fjvu3PkvrTOoIjNqL1vrJQ?select=8bxEWo47aCR19UIK3eh8Dg\u000aThe sides of Beans & Pickled Carrot Salad is unique and flavorful!\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fjvu3PkvrTOoIjNqL1vrJQ?select=c_fS-JOQv__lXA4lLY3BRw\u000aThese were easily the best Enchiladas I've ever had.\u000a\u000a+ Decor & Atmosphere.  From what the bartender told me, it's only been open 6 months or so.  The decor is unique...I have no idea how to describe it, otherwise I would....it feels upscale and modern, let's just say that.\u000a\u000a+ Friendly employees.  Everyone was really nice and offered suggestions on the menu.\u000a\u000a+ The Chocolate Lava Cake, $8.  Ok, I wasn't going to eat dessert, but the bartender talked me into it....I'm glad he did.  It was freakin' awesome!  However, I will warn you....it' a big portion, can easily feed 2 people.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fjvu3PkvrTOoIjNqL1vrJQ?select=hUdZO9aFRVVBbR_9IxQg-Q\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fjvu3PkvrTOoIjNqL1vrJQ?select=fViTAdL3HGNICqHPwuWx9w\u000aServed hot and moist, the Chocolate Cake melts in your mouth.....when you slice your spoon through the Cake, the hot Chocolate Lava center oozes out....together with the Vanilla Ice Cream on top, it makes for an awesome combo!\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a great experience.  I was told they have 2 happy hours, but forgot the times....it's an early and late schedule for them....so it can cover both early birds and night owls.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VStopped by on with my Son on Sunday for the special Cupcake Sale UYE......Cupcakes (no box, $1.50....if you brought a box, $1).  The location of this place is difficult to find.....trust your GPS, it's probably right.  They operate out of the kitchen for Renaissance Catering and you have to knock on the kitchen door, which is on the left side of the front entrance.\u000a\u000aOnce we got inside, we met the owner and Jessica.  They were both very cool and showed us the 3 flavors that were available when we arrived.....Red Velvet, Coconut, and Plain.  I ordered 4 Red Velvet, 2 Coconut, and 2 Plain.....we needed a box, so it was $12 for all 8, what a great deal!\u000a\u000aWe took our little treasure box of Cupcakes and rushed to the car to eat a couple before we left.  I had a Red Velvet & Plain and my Son had a Red Velvet and Coconut.  They were awesome!!  The Red Velvet was soft & moist and melted in your mouth.....yum!  The Plain was light and fluffy....also very good.  They both had the right proportion of frosting on it too....nomilicious!  (see pics)\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a fun adventure to find this hidden Cupcake heaven.  It was also hilarious because we saw fellow Yelper Tien and another car load of people driving up looking for the location like we did.  It felt like we were doing something illegal....ha!  The owner explained that she also does custom Cakes....I was thinking about getting a Chanel Purse Cake for The Better Half on her Birthday....we'll see.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

VHeard about this place on Yelp Talk and decided to try it out for myself....I'm glad I did.  This place is freakin' awesome!  It reminds me of the authentic Mexican food in So Cal.  The restaurant is located inside a Mexican market on the left side.  It was 6:30 on a Sunday evening and the line at the counter was 10 deep!  I hate lines, but stayed anyway....it was worth every minute.\u000a\u000aI decided to order:\u000aCarne Asada Burrito, $5.49\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DXn79Dzv8kpsMcNNKZHuRA?select=cC2AUIg0rdvATqfOiePgbQ\u000aAl Pastor Taco, $1.49\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DXn79Dzv8kpsMcNNKZHuRA?select=nZxeRphGx4OJhhXSk9qqnQ\u000a\u000aThe Carne Asada Burrito was awesome....the flavor of the Steak was as I remember it from back home.  The flavor of the other ingredients....Beans, Rice, Onions, Salsa, Cilantro.....was very good and proportioned correctly.  I was left wanting more, much more!  Glad I ordered the Taco Al Pastor....\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DXn79Dzv8kpsMcNNKZHuRA?select=gU0RY6b3sYgJoUplxVgn9A\u000a\u000aThe Taco Al Pastor was topped with a pile of Salsa, Cilantro, and fresh cut Onions....I took one bite and couldn't believe how good it was.  When I was growing up, my friends' family would cook these Tacos for special occasions like baptisms and Sunday BBQ's in the park.  This gem of a Taco hit the spot....full of flavor and fresh ingredients.\u000a\u000aThe one complaint I have is that the Salsa Bar didn't have anything that was remotely spicy....which surprised me.  The Salsa was your typical Pico de Gallo, which was good in it's own right....but nothing for people like me who like it Hot.\u000a\u000aOverall, great eats!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VThis gas station has gigantic lanes, which is weird because it 's located in the heart of  a North Scottsdale residential area.  There's not a lot of semi-truck traffic here, but it looks like it could easily accommodate them.  The price of gas is slightly higher than other gas stations in the area.  There's a convenience store located on premises.  Since it's sunk down a little below street level, I oftentimes forget it's here....so I rarely frequent this place.  At night the lanes are well lit, so it feels very safe.  Overall, it's a pretty good gas station.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VFor my 1300th review, I am going to review a lounge named after me...?!  :) Awesome!  I found this place via Groupon.  It's a small lounge/bar area in the Scottsdale Plaza Hotel.  There's a small bar sized (6 ft) pool table in the lounge as well as a few TV's so you can watch sports.\u000a\u000aDuring Happy Hour it gets pretty busy.  During my visits, I sampled the following menu items:\u000a\u000aNachos\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j-d-s-lounge-scottsdale?select=NoabkdWqBta-5RRtK-9opg#NoabkdWqBta-5RRtK-9opg\u000a\u000aPotato Skins\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j-d-s-lounge-scottsdale?select=BhrLIs6tTlghmU_u3AuU-A#BhrLIs6tTlghmU_u3AuU-A\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j-d-s-lounge-scottsdale?select=5IOo_SDPNd1AfPEdQwNzwg#5IOo_SDPNd1AfPEdQwNzwg\u000a\u000aCheese Sticks\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j-d-s-lounge-scottsdale?select=gfj_9__b4wBDoFmKVNq1IQ#gfj_9__b4wBDoFmKVNq1IQ\u000a\u000aThe food was average.  The Potato Skins were bland and quite small.  The Cheese Sticks were just OK.....so were the Nachos.  For a sports bar type lounge, that surprised me.  Usually, they get the bar food down pat.  \u000a\u000aThe service was so/so too.  One visit, it was good....the other it was bad.  There are too many other choices in town.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 30%

VThis place has been on my bucket for a while, going back to when I lived in Vegas.  When we had the opportunity to eat her on a recent visit, I couldn't say no.  After browsing the menu, I decided to go with the The Longhorn (Burger, Beef Brisket, Whiskey BBQ Sauce, Cole Slaw, Pickle), $16.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas?select=l0ExJUbDA_O0mX8qkPR_2Q#l0ExJUbDA_O0mX8qkPR_2Q\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas?select=GccYBoYbiRiDZTNsbEyRtg#GccYBoYbiRiDZTNsbEyRtg\u000a\u000aI took one bite of the Burger and fell in love with it.  The combination of Beef Brisket with the Burger was awesome.  The BBQ Sauce gave it a tangy flavor while the Slaw softened it up with a sweet, creamy flavor.....yum!\u000a\u000aOne thing though about this restaurant....the floor is really slippery.  Wifey almost fell walking in heels because it was so slippery.  While we were dining, we saw a few more people slip as well.  The floor wasn't wet or anything like that, I think it just gets slippery when it's clean....probably over-polished.\u000a\u000aDespite that danger, we'll be back.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

VDuring a recent trip to Vegas for a meeting, we dropped into this restaurant for a business lunch.  Having walked by this joint at dinner time and seen the large crowds, I was pleased to see very few people durung the lunch hour.\u000a\u000aWe were seated near the windows so we had nice sunlight coming into the room...which is rare for Vegas casino restaurants....nice touch.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Comme Ca Burger, $19.\u000a\u000aThe food came out in a reasonable amount of time and I immediately noticed that the Ketchup was homemade and not bottled....another plus.  The Burger was also a hand made patty, not frozen.  It was very juicy and delish...yum!\u000a\u000aThe server was pleasant and realized that we were at a business lunch, so she gave us our space to talk and work.  However, she remained attentive to our needs and ensured that our drinks/food were taken care of.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a great experience for a business lunch.....good food and service.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

I understand that it's the Strip and prices would be high, but for $16 at a place called "I Love Burgers", I was expecting to be blown away.  That said, I'll come back again and will try a few more menu items, it's that interesting to me.\u000a\u000aWe dined at the bar and the service was really good.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VLocated in the Cosmopolitan, this lounge has become one of my favorite in town.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a+ Superb people watching.  There are so many tables & booths located in this lounge that give you great line of sight for watching the hilarious tourists that come in/out of the hotel.  Good times.\u000a\u000a+ Decor.  The over the top crystal decor is what Vegas use to be, but in a modern design....a tribute to our history and it's done well.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Pob7ibbNT29--69nxXEP2g?select=GKlLNqaOabdEH-HPJ5MfOg\u000a\u000a+ Drinks.  The drinks and Wine servings are pretty good.  I haven't had a bad glass of Wine here yet.\u000a\u000aSome things they need to work on.....\u000a\u000a- Service.  Service here has been inconsistent.  It's either really good or really bad.  I hope it's just growing pains since they're relatively new.\u000a\u000a- The stairs to other levels.  The design is pretty cool, but it's not very functional.  If there are crowds going up and down, it can get tight....no bueno when you're trying to carry a glass of Red Wine, know what I mean?\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a fun place to go and hang with some friends.  This is the new meetup spot for visitors when they call and want to hangout.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VOh yeah, one of my favorite spots in Vegas.  Last visit a large group of us got 2 cabanas side by side on the left side of the pool area.  This gave us plenty of space to ourselves when it got crowded.  If you're planning to do some serious partying, then I suggest you get a cabana at the pool or a table/booth in the club, it's worth every penny.  A few pics of the cabana when we arrived:\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marquee-nightclub-and-dayclub-las-vegas?select=wKgLxE9Xb0sw278ESVEXIQ#wKgLxE9Xb0sw278ESVEXIQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marquee-nightclub-and-dayclub-las-vegas?select=SAwNvzYuXhyOk5M1FkToEA#SAwNvzYuXhyOk5M1FkToEA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marquee-nightclub-and-dayclub-las-vegas?select=zAh8t6bsDY7A16S4qn85-g#zAh8t6bsDY7A16S4qn85-g\u000a\u000aWe arrived early and got in before it got crazy busy.  Throughout the night, we went through several bottles of Goose.  We left around 2 am and the party was still going strong....ahhh, I miss living in Vegas!\u000a\u000aTotal damage: $3,000 ea for the Cabanas (inc 1 bottle ea), 6 more bottles @ $500 ea + Tip.....I think we spent $11,000 total.

VI was at the Scottsdale Quarter to visit the Genius Bar at the Apple Store and was a little early for my appointment.  Of course they won't take you early so I had to kill some time.

VAs many of my friends know, I love Sandwiches.....especially Jimmy Johns.  I stopped by this location and ordered a #9 Italian Club (Genoa Salami, Italian Capicola, Smoked Ham, Provolone Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Mayo, Italian Vinaigrette, $5.25) and added Hot Peppers, Vinegar Potato Chips ($1.39), and Soda ($.99).\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IRpZS7EmmBeSM7oBnDd5iw?select=8nTOvKrKJYePvqOUklYa0Q\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IRpZS7EmmBeSM7oBnDd5iw?select=1BQbD18J_MjO5NVKs53BuQ\u000a\u000aOf course the Sandwich was made within 2 minutes of ordering....I don't know how they can make a Sandwich so fast, but they do!\u000a\u000aThe Sandwich was excellent.....the Bread rocked of course and the Hot Peppers makes it so much better.\u000a\u000aWhile I was there, I looked at the menu and the JJ Gargantuan Sandwich piqued my interest....I will try that next time.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VEverybody knows that I love Pizza!  I also love the Cosmopolitan.  So, when I heard they had a Secret Pizza joint, I couldn't wait to give it a try.  I resisted the temptation to ask for help to find it and spent a good 2 hours looking for this place.  I finally gave up and asked an employee who gave me directions....they're not supposed to do that, LOL.\u000a\u000aThe setup is like the typical street-side quick Pizza joints you find in major city downtown areas.  The Pizzas are pre-cooked and warmed up to order by the Slice or by the Pie.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=Z-z_DCestFY90vmHPj-iSg#Z-z_DCestFY90vmHPj-iSg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=LXFr4Kgn5aUPTV8pxEqIzQ#LXFr4Kgn5aUPTV8pxEqIzQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=JFQEuBrHJcjMJ1lqP_1HHg#JFQEuBrHJcjMJ1lqP_1HHg\u000a\u000aI ordered a Slice of Pepperoni & Sausage, my 'go to' order.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=Fk3XJrpND-_-Bu0XGSCbug#Fk3XJrpND-_-Bu0XGSCbug\u000a\u000aThe Pizza was reheated to a very hot temp and served on a paper plate.  The flavor was very good.  The Sausage slightly overpowered the Pepperoni, but they complimented each other well.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a good experience and the Pizza was above average.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VA couple of weeks ago, I passed by this shopping center in my neighborhood and saw the sign "Harold's Chicken, Now Open!".  I thought to myself "That place sounds familiar, where do I know it from?"......a couple of weeks go by and I forgot about it.  \u000a\u000aThen, the other day I was starving and looking for a new joint to check out.  I looked on my Droid Yelp App and started doing a search for places....that's when I saw a review from Aljamin S on this place.  As soon as I read it, I remembered where I saw Harold's Chicken before.....in Southeast Chicago a couple of years ago.  I get really excited and call my friend in Vegas that's from Chicago who took me there.....he got excited and told me to get over there ASAP to check it out.\u000a\u000aWhen I pulled up, I saw a sign that mentioned they were from Chicago...I got excited.  I asked the cook who was standing next to the cashier if they were the same Harold's Chicken from Chicago...he said yes....JACKPOT!\u000a\u000aI eagerly ordered the 1/4 Chicken Dinner w/White Meat & Hot Sauce (2 Wings, 1 Breast, Fries, on top of a slice of White Bread, $5.99) and a Pizza Puff ($3.15).  After a short wait, they brought out my meal.....I opened up the bag with the Chicken and the smell of the Hot Sauce burned my sinuses....yes!  I couldn't wait to take a bite.  The Chicken and Fries drenched in Hot Sauce with the White Bread on the bottom to soak in the flavors was just as I remembered it in Chicago.  The Chicken was delicious and full of flavor.....my Hot Sauce tolerance has elevated since the last time I ate at Harold's, so the Hot Sauce tasted more mild to me than I remember....but it was good!  The Fries were soggy with the Hot Sauce....I forgot they did that and would have preferred them dry, my bad  I should have asked them to do that.  Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!\u000a\u000aNext was the Pizza Puff....if you've been reading my reviews for a while, you'll know I love Pizza Puffs and will order one any time I can find it.  They serve the Il Taco brand Pizza Puffs here....which is what I'm familiar with from Chicago.  mmmm......Pizza Puff goodness, yes!  If you are unfamiliar with a Pizza Puff, imagine a wallet sized pocket of Pizza Dough, with Pizza Sauce, Cheese, and Sausage in the middle.....it's not a Calzone because the crust is much thinner and it has a distinctive taste and flavor to it.  It's also deep fried....although you can bake it as well.  Anyway, I suggest you try one if given the opportunity.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was an exciting day.  I called all of my Chicagoland friends who are transplants in Vegas to tell them about this place.\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Oh yeah!

VI really like this place.  This is a great place to have lunch or happy hour drinks.  It's located at the Scottsdale Quarter right next to a very nice iPic movie theater, so it's convenient for pre/post movie cocktails as well.\u000a\u000aLunch is my favorite time to come.  The Prosciutto di Parma Ciabatta and the Turkey Panini are two of my favorite dishes.  They're both only $10 ea and comes with Parmesan Fries, which are addicting...yum!\u000a\u000aThe lunch crowd here is relatively light for Scottsdale, which means you'll get in/out pretty fast.  Service here is always very good.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VIf you want to start a business and file for a LLC, this is where you need to go if you want to expedite your paperwork.  When you file for a LLC you can either send it in via snail mail or come here for expedited service, which costs more money.  Nevada is a great state to incorporate.....there are so many favorable laws for corporations here, I'm surprised there aren't more people setting up businesses in our state.\u000a\u000aThe office is located on the 5th Floor of the Grant Sawyer Building.  The office is small and can get very busy.  You wait in a line until they call you up to the counter.  In order to save you some time, be sure to complete your paperwork BEFORE you come here.....I've seen people wait in line for 10-15 min only to be given paperwork to fill out and then told to wait in the line again.  Be prepared people!\u000a\u000aOnce you get to the counter the service is pretty quick.  You pay your fee(s), get your receipt, and you're done.  Very efficient.\u000a\u000aI took a Star off because of the small, cramped area that you wait in and because they only offer expedited service here.  Why not offer both?\u000a\u000aWill I return?  Next company I start, you bet!

VLocated in Old Town Scottsdale, I've been to this location a few times to meet colleagues for lunch.  It's a trendy spot for people to have lunch as it's always packed no matter what day it is.\u000a\u000aMy favorite lunch item is the Turkey Ciabatta (Gouda Cheese, Smoked Bacon, Sweet Tomato, Roasted Red Pepper Aioli), $11.  It has a perfect blend of ingredients that has a combination of smoked & sweet flavors with the Turkey.  This is great for lunch because it's satisfying, but does not weigh you down during the afternoon.\u000a\u000aOne of these days I will have to come back for dinner.  I tell myself that every time I have lunch here, but always seem to forget about it when we're looking for places to eat.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 85%

VThis radio station features dance/electronica music.  I enjoy listening to it, however they play the same tracks over and over.....it gets old real fast.  I pop in from time to time to break the monotony.\u000a\u000aAnother thing I like about this radio station is that there are very few commercial breaks.\u000a\u000aWill I continue to listen?  Sure, but need a break now and then.

VWas in town for a conference and one of the companies I do business with invited us to a private event here.  We were in the back bar area and the patio out back.  This place is awesome for hosting parties.  \u000a\u000aThe staff greets you as you walk in and immediately offers you a glass of Wine or Beer.  Hors d'oeuvres were passed by servers.  I had the Kobe Sliders and Flatbread....they were awesome.  The Wine was very good too.  On the patio there are very comfortable chairs and sofas.  They even have a couple of those chairs that hang from ropes....very fun to sit in and have a couple of glasses of Wine.\u000a\u000aCigar smoking was allowed on the back patio....a few people took advantage of it and the awesome weather we had that night.\u000a\u000aOverall, I was very impressed with this restaurant and their staff.  I want to come back and have dinner.  Their service is definitely 5 Stars and the food is a solid 4-4.5 Stars.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VI respect what the folks in uniform do for the community and oftentimes it goes without any gratitude from us.  The Highway Patrol have to deal with accidents and people who are pissed off about getting a ticket.....in other words, there's no real upside to this job, unless you really enjoy serving the community.  I appreciate them keeping our highways safe!\u000a\u000aKudos to the Men & Women in Blue, this review is for you!\u000a\u000aPS - Only 4 Stars because of all of the tickets you gave me.....I know, I deserved it.  :)

VI love shopping at the Forum Shops.  There's such a great variety of stores and the people watching is priceless!\u000a\u000aThe last visit here, I bought a set of Ping irons at the Callaway Store.....yes, I couldn't believe it either!  I normally don't buy items like this at a mall like this because 9 times out of 10 it's a ripoff.  However, this wasn't the case......they were significantly less than other golf shops.\u000a\u000aAfter I saw the price tag, I called around town to see if there were any better deals.....one guy said "If that's the real price for those irons, you better buy them on the spot....you won't find them for that price anywhere else!".....so, of course I did it!\u000a\u000aThe other fun part about this mall is that Pete Rose frequently signs autographs at a memorabilia store here.....he's always a character.  If you haven't met him, I suggest you stop by that store when he's there.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's always a good time at the Forum Shops.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VPart of my Pizza Bender 2011 Edition, I stopped by this place and decided to give their 2 Slice special a try.  2 Slices of Cheese Pizza & a fountain drink for $5.....pretty good deal.  I added Sausage & Pepperoni for an additional $1 ($.50 per topping).\u000a\u000aThe joint is decked out in Boston photos and memorabilia.....be prepared to get a talking to if you walk in here with other sports teams gear.  A guy with a Lakers hat was catching some guff from the owner.  It was all in good fun and they were both having fun talking a bit of trash about the other team.  Hilarious.\u000a\u000aAfter a few minutes my Pizza came out.  It's a thin Crust variety, very similar to NY Style.  I'm not calling it NY Style because it's a Boston Pizza joint.  The slices are pretty big and you have to fold it if you want to eat it with your hands.....I like it better that way.  The Pizza was pretty good....above average.  I thought the Sausage was much better than the Pepperoni.  The Pepperoni wasn't anything special.  The Cheese was gooey and had good flavor.  I didn't have to add anything to the Pizza, I enjoyed it as is.\u000a\u000aOverall, It's a pretty good Pizza.  If I could, I'd give it 3.75 Stars, but I'm rounding up here.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%....would be higher if I lived nearby.

VI'm a huge fan of Fox Restaurants, so whenever I'm in the area for a Suns game or for business, I try to stop here for a bite or drink.  My favorite item on the menu is the Turkey Pastrami Sandwich (Coleslaw, Swiss, Pretzel Bun), $12....it is soooo good!\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-arrogant-butcher-phoenix?select=oALX-Epc5ncGx6Aa93_DfQ#oALX-Epc5ncGx6Aa93_DfQ\u000a\u000aThe atmosphere is very casual and fun.  It's across the street from US Airways Arena, so it will be extremely busy on nights when the Suns play.  Awesome place to meetup for a pre-game drink though.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

VWatched a Spring Training game here a couple of months ago.  It's a new facility and is amazing!  Here are some things I liked about it:\u000a\u000a+ Easy parking.\u000a\u000a+ Great seats.  Not a bad seat in the house!\u000a\u000a+ Awesome view of the action.  It's surrounded by several practice fields, so you can watch the other players training.  Great for kids.\u000a\u000a+ Nice, friendly employees.  They were so helpful in showing us around.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a fun time at the ballpark.  Can't wait for next year!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 97%

VTime for a review update.  Salt River Fields is awesome.  Besides Spring Training games, this place is a happening spot for festivals and concerts.  Over the past few years, we've attended a ton of events here and it's always a lot of fun....Food Truck Festival, Octoberfest, Taco Festival, Dierk's Bentley, BBQ Festival, Balloon Fest, Halloween Spooktacular.\u000a\u000aHere's why it's such a great place for events:\u000a\u000a+ Parking is easy.  It's also free for most of these events.  In the beginning they were charging for parking, now most are free.\u000a\u000a+ Events here are so easy to get in/out.  Even when it's packed, it's not a big hassle like other festival locations I've been to around town.\u000a\u000a+ The food booths and drink selection here is always good....especially for the BBQ and Food Truck Festivals....so many choices!\u000a\u000a+ The VIP area/ticket offering is awesome and convenient.  They don't oversell their VIP tickets, so it's comfortable and makes the experience more enjoyable.  Plus the free drinks is awesome too.\u000a\u000a+ Spring Training games are awesome.  All of my prior comments still apply.  It's my favorite stadium to watch spring training games.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VMet some colleagues here for dinner one evening.  Located in the Scottsdale Quarter, this high end restaurant is a great place for dinner.  If you're price sensitive, this is not the place for you....don't even bother.  Our reservation was for 6:45 pm and it was jam packed, good thing we called ahead.  We were promptly seated in the main dining room.\u000a\u000aAfter browsing the extensive menu, I decided to order:\u000a\u000aBaby Iceberg BLT Wedge - (Bacon, Maytag Blue Cheese, Buttermilk-Chive Dressing), $9\u000aTwin Lobster Tails - Broiled, MKT Price\u000aTruffle Mac 'n Cheese, $6 (for small portion)\u000aGodiva Chocolate w/Vanilla Ice Cream\u000a\u000aAll of the food was excellent.  The Twin Lobster Tails were perfect and came with Butter to dip them in.  They were so good, I used very little Butter.  I enjoyed the broiled flavor on it's own.  The Truffle Mac 'n Cheese was very rich & creamy, amazing.\u000a\u000aThe BLT Wedge was very good too, but the portion was too large and I had to leave 1/2 of it because I didn't want to be full when my entree came out.\u000a\u000aAt the urging of my colleagues, I ordered the Godiva Chocolate w/Vanilla Ice Cream.  It was awesome, but very rich.  I had to split it with everyone because there was no way I could finish it after the big meal.  The hot Godiva Chocolate oozed out of the center of the Cake....and the Vanilla Ice Cream complimented it perfectly.\u000a\u000aThe service here was impeccable.  They have a great staff.  Can't wait for my next visit.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

The weather was still a little warm, so it was slightly uncomfortable for the guys in our group who had on long sleeved shirts and jackets.\u000a\u000aThe party itself was awesome though.  The music and vibe was good.  The bars on the roof are small and get cramped once it gets busy.  Not sure how they can fix that without re-designing the VIP booths nearby.  Cocktail service was non-existent....I never saw a server and had to go to the bar to get drinks all night long.\u000a\u000aThis place gets 4 Stars for vibe/ambiance, 2 Stars for service, 3 Stars overall.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VAnother stop on our day of Antique shopping, we stopped by this store.  This was the first time we've been to this store.  We came here with a few friends who was showing us around.\u000a\u000aThe store is well organized and most importantly, well lit.  There's nothing more annoying than darkly lit antique stores....it makes it difficult to see the product and get a good gauge of what you're buying if it's not well lit.\u000a\u000aThe Better Half and I didn't find anything on our wish list, but we had a lot of fun browsing the dealers' booths.  Our friend found an old magazine that featured a photo shoot of Phoenix from the 1960's.....he opened the magazine and showed us some old parts of downtown that were no longer there.  Since he's been around since then, he was able to walk down memory lane with every picture.....isn't that what antique shopping is all about?\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VA friend and I stopped by this joint after having a few drinks at the W.  It's a short walk, couple of blocks, away.  It was the middle of the week around 9 pm and the place was half full....good crowd, decent vibe.  We saddled up to a table near the bar and close to the patio.  We ordered a couple of drinks and people watched for an hour or so.\u000a\u000aThey serve a specialty Margarita here that's served in a large glass and a full Corona bottle turned upside down inside the glass, they call it a "Beer-garita".....it looks ridiculous.  Even more hilarious was the number of people who were walking around drinking this monstrosity....it reminds me of the tourists in Vegas who walk around with those giant tubes of Hurricanes or Margaritas....great people watching I tell ya!\u000a\u000aOur server was very attentive and made sure our glasses remained full.  The music was pretty good too....a DJ was playing house/dance music.  Overall, it was a fun time.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VI'm in the area frequently, so I eat lunch here often when I'm in need of a quick bite to eat.  Nine times out of ten, it's a good experience as long as I get here before 12 pm.  Once 12 pm hits, it's impossible to find a table/seat since it's the start of the lunch rush.\u000a\u000aMy fav items to get are 7 Layer Burritos and Bean Burritos.  This location makes larger than average portions too, so you get your money's worth.\u000a\u000aThe employees here are usually friendly and helpful.  That's one of the reasons I come back so often.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VThis place has so much potential but it's inconsistent customer service prevents it from being a top notch joint.  We come here every weekend to watch college football games.  The food is decent for a sports bar.  Over the course of the season I've had:\u000a\u000aGorilla Wings - $9\u000a\u000aBasket of Fries - $3.50\u000a\u000aFully Loaded Pizza (Italian Sausage, Pepperoni, Green Peppers, Mushrooms, Onions, Black Olives, Mozzarella, Parmesan and Cheddar) - $12\u000a\u000aItalian Panini - Genoa Salami, Pepperoni, Ham, Provolone, Tomatoes, Lettuce, Vinaigrette, on Sourdough Bread) - $9.50\u000a\u000aBuffalo Chicken Wrap - $9.50\u000a\u000aChicken Quesadilla - $9.50\u000a\u000aYes, the prices are a bit high...but you're in Old Town Scottsdale, where prices are high everywhere.  During the football season, pints of domestic draft Beer are cheap so it makes up for the food pricing.\u000a\u000aThe food quality is mediocre.  By far my favorite items are the Italian Panini and the Gorilla Wings served with Maniac Sauce, which is pretty hot.  The Chicken Quesadilla is ~meh~, a bit soggy and doesn't have much flavor.\u000a\u000aWhere they really fall short is their inconsistent service.  When they're not busy (during ASU home games) the service is great.  However, when they're busy (ASU road games) the staff is overloaded and can't handle large crowds.  I think it's because they hire young, inexperienced kids who have an attitude.  On at least 3 occasions I've been told "I'm real busy right now, I'll come get your order when I can" or "I don't know, ask someone else, too busy right now"....come on!\u000a\u000aThey'll never change because being in Old Town, they'll always have the business and don't have to worry about repeat, loyal customers.  If my friends didn't come here every week, we wouldn't come here as often as we do.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - a begrudging 80%, 30% if we didn't meet up here to watch college football

VLocated inside the Palazzo on the 2nd floor in the middle of the mall, this place was one of our favorite places to grab a glass of Wine or Beer when we lived in Vegas.  During our recent trip back to town, we decided to stop by here for a couple of drinks before we went to The Act Nightclub.\u000a\u000aFirst of all, we were happy to see that it was still in business.  Half of us ordered a glass of Wine and the other half ordered a chalice of Stella.  We hung out for about an hour and enjoyed the people watching.  Since it's located in one of the main intersections of the mall, you can see people walking around in all directions.  There were also several characters hanging out at the bar, which were fun to watch.\u000a\u000aIf you're looking for a place to have a nice glass of Wine and Beer, give this place a shot.  They also deliver to all hotels on the Strip, so take a look at their Wine menu and if there's a bottle you like, they'll take it to you.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VI played this golf course for the first time last week.  I am very impressed.  So far, it's one of my favorite golf course in Arizona.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a+ The course is kept in great shape.  Fairways, excellent and the greens were soft and rolled true.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eagle-mountain-golf-club-fountain-hills?select=UqYXQGNAtScIvcVrmMo1Dw#UqYXQGNAtScIvcVrmMo1Dw\u000a\u000a+ The design of the course is challenging but offers a nice option of distances from the various tees....this allows for a nice variety of options for various skill levels in the same group to play together.\u000a\u000a+ I love the rolling hills and changes in elevation.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eagle-mountain-golf-club-fountain-hills?select=cmmUzMXaihxf5keZpadxLA#cmmUzMXaihxf5keZpadxLA\u000a\u000a+ The greens are fun to putt on...they're not flat and offer a challenge on all putts.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eagle-mountain-golf-club-fountain-hills?select=50NZhNK5YNoVMm8ipX3s5A#50NZhNK5YNoVMm8ipX3s5A\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eagle-mountain-golf-club-fountain-hills?select=7LDMLKsddbQ816uGBZW_jA#7LDMLKsddbQ816uGBZW_jA\u000a\u000a+ The views of Phoenix are spectacular.

VDropped in here to pick up a few items during the Christmas shopping period. It was tough because they had a new guy working and he didn't know how to use the computer real well so checkout took forever. I normally wouldn't hold that against an establishment, but it was how the supervisor handled it that I'm giving them 2 Stars. Instead of helping the guy through the entire process, he would only help a little and then leave him alone, which made the process agonizingly slow. \u000a\u000aI could understand if he was doing this to assist other customers, but he wasn't. He was flirting with the other 2 girls who worked there...talking about whether they liked the new Samsung Galaxy or the iPhone 5...ridiculous. \u000a\u000aI felt really bad for the new guy. I hope it gets better for him. I bought what I needed and then bolted out of there. It took 20 min to get through my checkout....no exaggeration. \u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 30%

VTime for a review update.  Since my first review 2 yrs ago, we've used Max's several times when they have coupons.  Oftentimes, the coupons are deceptive.  For instance, it will have a discount for shirts....but when we take the shirts in for cleaning they'll charge us much more.  When asked why, they say "well, this shirt is silk therefore it costs more".....wait, what?  There's no restrictions on the coupon!  Doesn't matter, won't win the argument.  Oh well, we moved on to another cleaner.\u000a\u000aToo bad because we live nearby.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 2%

VI've had so much hope for this place.  I've been here several times and always leave disappointed.  The parking situation around Old Town sucks and the Mint is no different.  Unless you get there super early, it's impossible to find a close parking spot.  \u000a\u000aAlso, they are really lackadaisical with their dress code during the weekdays.  The Better Half and I stopped in one night on a Wednesday and there were guys in baseball hats and t-shirts screaming and yelling on the patio like they just came from the ghetto.  I asked our server why they were allowed inside and she said "our dress code isn't really enforced during the week"....great.  It would have been nice to know that before we ordered a bottle of Wine.  Instead of a nice evening on the patio, it felt like an ASU tailgate.  If we wanted that scene, we would have went to Majerle's or El Hefe.\u000a\u000aThe food here is so/so....the menu has a limited selection to choose from.  After dining here 3 times we basically were tapped out for choices.  Service here is spotty at best.  We had great service one night and horrible service the other 5 times.\u000a\u000aThe best thing this place has going for it is the scene.  It definitely brings out the beautiful people and celebs.  However, be prepared to shell out beaucoup $$$ if you want to party with them.\u000a\u000aOverall, it gets 3 Stars from me.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VHmmm....Breakfast, one of my favorite meals.  When we're in Vegas, we enjoy coming here for breakfast.  It was a regular place for us when we lived here.  A couple of our favorite dishes are Eggs Benedict and the Denver Omelet w/Hash Browns.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-caf%C3%A9-las-vegas-7?select=dUmJWwUg7lAohYr4id0oXg#dUmJWwUg7lAohYr4id0oXg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-caf%C3%A9-las-vegas-7?select=I3n0MlSkKE1Cy4f-nughhA#I3n0MlSkKE1Cy4f-nughhA\u000a\u000aThe service is so/so.  We'll get great service about 60% of the time.  Usually the bad service is when it gets busy....It can get pretty busy in here, so the trick is to come between meal periods.  \u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VDuring a conference held downtown, a company hosted a happy hour party here.  Although I've been in the area dozens of times, it was my first experience in this place.  The party was held out in the patio area.\u000a\u000aIt was a great spot to host the party....we had our own bar and food setup, so getting drinks and appetizers was easy.  It was an open bar during the party, so I don't have a sense of how much the drinks are here.\u000a\u000aThe party was held in early April, so the weather for a party out on the patio was perfect.  The place looks like a cool spot to come hang out before a Suns game....will have to keep this in mind for next season.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VAttended an industry event here recently after a conference. This is one of the highlights of downtown Phoenix.  It's located on the 2nd floor of the building across from US Airways Arena.  It's much smaller than I expected, but it handled the 100+ people at the event well.\u000a\u000aThe servers are friendly and attentive.  The food was so/so.  The event hosts had self-serve Nachos, Flatbread, and Wraps.  It was above average for an event like this.  I want to come back and try something from the real menu.\u000a\u000aThere's a small patio that overlooks 1st St and Jefferson.  Too bad there's not much of a regular nightlife scene in downtown Phoenix, otherwise this could be a hot spot.  This is definitely on my list of pre-party joints before a Suns game.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

I was able to buy some magazines, a couple of semi-auto pistols, and other accessories for wholesale prices.  Very nice!\u000a\u000aI wish I heard about the sale sooner, I heard there was some awesome deals to be had.

VFound this place via Groupon.  It has a nice vibe to it.  Hard to find though....it's located on the 2nd floor and it's not obvious how to get up there.  It's also not obvious where you should park....there are 3 options:\u000a\u000a1 - Street parking.  However, arrive at happy hour and you'll be circling around forever trying to find a spot.\u000a\u000a2 - Parking lot.  There are a few small parking lots around the area.  Best bet if you want to self park.  Just be careful you're not in a tow zone for a building that only allows you to park there if you go into one of their businesses.\u000a\u000a3 - Valet lot.  There's a valet parking service that on the opposite corner of this place.  It will cost you $$$.\u000a\u000aOnce you get inside the place, it's a cool joint.  They have live music outside on the patio and if the weather is great, it will be packed out there.  The vibe inside is pretty cool too....it's dark, which I like.  I don't like lounges that are well lit....to me, that's not a lounge experience.\u000a\u000aThe food is pretty good too.  The Better Half and I shared the Short Rib Tacos ($13), Jerk Pork Sliders ($10), Pita & Hummus ($9), and the Edamame ($6).  The Short Rib Tacos were fantastic and my favorite out of the bunch.  The Sliders were good too.  The Pita & Hummus and Edamame were nice appetizers to get us started.  \u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 85%

There's a very large selection of Wine and most importantly, they have a great selection of Wine that's $5.99 or less....and the cheap Wine doesn't taste like 2 Buck Chuck either....it's great table Wine for everyday drinking.  I've bought over 300 bottles of Wine less than $5.99 at this place and have never thrown out a single bottle...that's a pretty good track record.\u000a\u000aThey also have a nice selection of Beer and Spirits....although, I have to admit, this place is not always top of mind when I'm shopping for those type of alcoholic drinks.\u000a\u000aThe staff here is very friendly and I enjoy browsing the employee selections, which are featured Wines the employees select.\u000a\u000aI'll definitely be back.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VLiving Social brought us to this place.  It's located in Old Town, near all of the nightlife.  However, it's kind of tucked away on a side street one block away from most of the action.  I've driven past this place at least a dozen times and didn't notice it.\u000a\u000aWe went during the middle of the week, when it's not full of youngsters and partiers.  When we walked in, I noticed it smelled like a college bar.....musty, greasy, alcohol-ly....Is that a word?  Those of you who've been in these kind of bars know what I'm talking about.\u000a\u000aWe tried several menu items here, Burgers, Onion Rings, Mozzarella Sticks, etc.  All of them were mediocre at best.  Perhaps I would have a different opinion and taste if it didn't smell so bad in there.\u000a\u000aAnother thing that annoyed me is the prize wheel they have in the lower bar area.  It's a giant wheel, like you see at a casino, except that it has nails and a metal strip to stop it....when we were here some college kids were spinning this thing (for no reason) and it made a god-awful sound clanging like a cowbell, but 100x worse.  Of course, none of the staff cared to stop them.....this went on for 10-15 minutes.\u000a\u000aThe 2nd time we dropped by, the air conditioner wasn't working and it was muggy in the restaurant....plus, the elevator to the 2nd floor broke down with several college kids stuck inside, so the fire department had to come rescue them.....big drama in numbnutzville.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a terrible experience.  There are lots of better options out there.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 2%

VThis is easily one of my favorite Steakhouses in Arizona.  It reminds me of Vegas when I'm here.  Why?  Because it's always full of life & energy...at least before 9 pm....and the food & service is outstanding.  I've dined here several times for personal & business reasons.  Each time, Dominick's delivers in the clutch.\u000a\u000aWhen I'm entertaining clients, I enjoy dining in the back room on the 3rd level.  It's best suited for that scenario.  When I'm here with The Better Half and we want some privacy, then we ask to be seated anywhere but the bar area.  When TBH and I just want some appetizers and a glass of Wine or a late night drink, we sit at the bar.\u000a\u000aSome menu items I've had here:\u000a\u000aIceberg Wedge Salad, $10.95\u000aTomato & Mozzarella, $12.95\u000aFried Meatballs Appetizer, $14.95\u000a\u000aPetite Filet Mignon (8oz), $41.95\u000aFilet Mignon (12oz), $47.95\u000aMashed Potatoes, $9.95\u000aAu Gratin Potatoes, $13.95\u000aCreamed Sweet Corn, $9.95\u000a\u000aThe Salads are pretty hearty portions, so be prepared.  The Bleu Cheese Dressing on the Wedge Salad is very good and rich.  If you're hungry, split the Meatballs Appetizer....it's very good, but I don't recommend having it by yourself.\u000a\u000aSimply put, the Filet is awesome.  Depending on my hunger level, I will either get the petite or the regular size.  They cook it to your preference.  I like it Medium-Well.\u000a\u000aTheir sides are enough to easily feed 2 or 3 people.  TBH and I usually share an order of Mashed Potatoes or Au Gratin.  When I'm dining with clients, I usually get 2 or 3 for the table so they can sample them....the Sweet Corn is amazing.\u000a\u000aTheir Wine selection is excellent....we've had so many good ones here.\u000a\u000aThe service is outstanding.  In 10+ visits here, I've never had bad service.\u000a\u000aSome notes:\u000aAlthough there's not really a "dress code", I've heard that they won't seat people who are not dressed appropriately.  Shorts & flip-flops, t-shirts, jeans, etc....they'll probably tell you that there aren't any available tables....that's hearsay, but I'm passing it along so there are no surprises.  I've never showed up here dressed casual, so I don't have personal experience with it.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VWhen I lived in Vegas this part of downtown was just starting to get redeveloped.  Since I left in 2011, I haven't seen the progress.  So, on a recent trip, I decided to check it out for myself to see what was going on.  I told The Better Half to save her appetite so we could sample some food in the area.  After walking around a bit, we decided to check out this joint.  We ordered:\u000a\u000aPad Thai Tofu, $13\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-thai-las-vegas?select=2MDRNsUbJhq1-6P5SzQS6w#2MDRNsUbJhq1-6P5SzQS6w\u000a\u000aPad See Ew, $13\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-thai-las-vegas?select=jwQ2r-YOmMef6Mn9yISnkQ#jwQ2r-YOmMef6Mn9yISnkQ\u000a\u000aThe food came out shortly after we ordered it and we dug into our dishes.  They were very good!  I had the Pad Thai and it had the right combination of sweet and spicy flavors...and they cooked the Tofu just how I ordered it, a little crispy.  Believe it or not, many Thai restaurants can't get that right.  The Better Half enjoyed her Pad See Ew.\u000a\u000aOur server and the hostess who sat us were very friendly and offered warm smiles despite being very busy with many demanding customers.\u000a\u000aThe only small complaints I have is that the seating in the front room is kind of tight.  We could easily hear the conversations of the tables next to us and the elbow room was less than ideal.  I felt like we had to whisper so that they couldn't hear our conversation.  Also, parking is a bit of a challenge.  You'll have to park at a nearby parking garage or casino and walk here....which isn't too much of a problem if this area is your destination for the evening.\u000a\u000aOverall, great restaurant.  Glad to see them busy and they appear to be thriving. \u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 92%

VCapriottis came into the local market not too long after I moved here from Vegas.  I was very happy to see them here as I need to feed my Sandwich addiction from time to time.  This location is the nicest and largest Capriotti's I've ever seen....and I love it!\u000a\u000aI had the 12" Italian Sandwich w/Hot Peppers, $8.49 and added Chips for $.99.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/capriottis-sandwich-shop-scottsdale?select=EyClKSbI5ui45ICOgtZN8w#EyClKSbI5ui45ICOgtZN8w\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/capriottis-sandwich-shop-scottsdale?select=2VZnwSnZBXzZq-S1FwglWw#2VZnwSnZBXzZq-S1FwglWw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/capriottis-sandwich-shop-scottsdale?select=C4MUzxU6nmBQbWBk-Y20tw#C4MUzxU6nmBQbWBk-Y20tw\u000a\u000aThe Sandwich tasted just like the Sandwiches in Vegas...so it's consistent across their stores.  My favorite topping is the Hot Peppers....they're legitimately hot, which is how I like it.  I can't stand it when Sandwich shops advertise "Hot" Peppers when in fact they're really mild.\u000a\u000aThe employees here are friendly and keep the place clean.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VThis place opened up about a year before I left Vegas and I didn't get to try it before I moved.  So on our most recent visit, we decided to stop by and give it a try.  When you walk in, you have to "check-in" with a nurse.  She explains that you have to put on a hospital gown to eat, no exceptions.  It was kind of cheesy, but we decided to go through with it.  We put the gown on and got seated.\u000a\u000aThe place is unapologetic about the calories, fat content, and "unhealthiness" of their food....I love it.  It's decorated with items that pay homage to the Burger and fast food in general.  Great atmosphere!\u000a\u000aAfter browsing the menu, we decided to order:\u000a\u000aSingle Bypass Burger w/Chili, $8.33 w/Bacon add $.92\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=uj3i3yx8JLKs3lPRgX-DPg#uj3i3yx8JLKs3lPRgX-DPg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=QQIixogPUXOCtbBApuY8uA#QQIixogPUXOCtbBApuY8uA\u000a\u000aDouble Bypass Burger w/Chili, $10.18 w/Fries add $1.85\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=iMGyagPk5P5CEFeL-i2MTg#iMGyagPk5P5CEFeL-i2MTg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=d9VovEyM0XKeZtaXLsxx-g#d9VovEyM0XKeZtaXLsxx-g\u000a\u000a24 oz Old English 800, $4.62\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=XlYk2VgSXo9EnsgDwaW2KA#XlYk2VgSXo9EnsgDwaW2KA\u000a\u000aWhile we were waiting for our food, we saw some people getting spanked really hard with a paddle by their nurse server....what the heck is going here?

You can't make this stuff up!\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=cUc5xHa4bttx2mE06C8WAg#cUc5xHa4bttx2mE06C8WAg\u000a\u000aPeople were getting spanked like crazy throughout dinner....some people did it just so they could get pictures taken and posted on social media.

VStrange little hotel tucked in a weird part of Old Town Scottsdale, I guess this place has been through multiple owners and never seems to be able to be successful.  It's old and has been fixed up to be "retro cool".  However, it's not attractive to me....it doesn't make me want to come hang out here.\u000a\u000aI like to come here because when I go to restaurants in the area, their parking is convenient.  Also, it's easy parking to find during Spring Training games.....but you have to pay $5, which is worth it.\u000a\u000aI would've probably rated them 4 Stars, but they closed the Whiskey Bar/Lounge in the lobby....which had awesome Pickles and bar food.  I've attended networking mixers and group functions in their pool courtyard and it was average....felt like I was in a throwback to the 1970's.\u000a\u000aThe service here (Valet, Front Desk, Concierge, F&B staff) is above average and friendly.  Too bad the building is so weird and uninviting.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VThis place is small, but what it lacks in size it makes up for in quality fun.  We've been here a few times on Sat night.  The music is always good and the people watching is even better.  If you decide to come check it out, I recommend getting a VIP section because this place gets packed like sardines.  They're all a little bit elevated from the main floor and spacious.  There's plenty of room and the vantage point is perfect.\u000a\u000aIf I was 10 yrs younger, I'd be here more often.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VI typically drop by the shopping center this joint is located in to grab a bite from a different restaurant.  One day, this one caught my eye, so I stopped in to see what it was all about.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that they serve up both Burgers and Mexican dishes....two of my fav's!  I've been here a few times, and here's what I've tried:\u000a\u000aBueno Burger (Guacamole, Salsa, Jalapeno Relish, Bueno Sauce, Lettuce), $6.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bueno-burger-scottsdale?select=kWewQ-xSnrT41cAiz4nf9Q#kWewQ-xSnrT41cAiz4nf9Q\u000a\u000aBean & Cheese Burrito, $4.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bueno-burger-scottsdale?select=YLd7kIlPXgOv0gV4oGesXA#YLd7kIlPXgOv0gV4oGesXA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bueno-burger-scottsdale?select=bptdJoBB5ihOYMKDZxOypw#bptdJoBB5ihOYMKDZxOypw\u000a\u000aQuesadilla, $3.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bueno-burger-scottsdale?select=jGaSLpAupuiiDelOxf34vw#jGaSLpAupuiiDelOxf34vw\u000a\u000aThe Quesadilla is so/so, but the Bueno Burger and Bean & Cheese Burrito rocks!  The Burger has a nice sized portion of Guac in it...they don't skimp here.  \u000a\u000aThe Bean & Cheese Burrito is made with Black or Pinto Beans, not Refried Beans, and it tastes sooo good!  It also has Sour Cream and Rice in it....which tickles your taste buds.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a pretty good dining option for quick eats.

VLocated in the Tempe Marketplace Mall, this restaurant is a favorite place for me to meet someone for lunch.  Because it's situated just off the 101 and 202 freeways, it's very convenient for meeting someone halfway between 2 distant cities in the Phoenix area.  I've setup lunch meetings and happy hour get togethers here....it seems to work well for us.  I've tried the following menu items:\u000a\u000aPepper Bacon Cheeseburger - $11.50\u000aSliders - $8.95\u000aUltimate Nachos - $9.95\u000a\u000aOut of the group, my favs are the Nachos and the Cheeseburger.  The Nachos are pretty large and can easily feed 2 people....although I took care of them by myself, ha!  The Pepper Bacon Cheeseburger is full of flavor and the spice from the Pepper on the Bacon compliments the juicy Burger very well.\u000a\u000aThe Sliders are pretty good as well.  It's a good lunchtime option.  There's plenty of parking at the mall and it's conveniently located at the West end of the mall, so you don't have to walk around too much to get there.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VI've dined at their Old Town location before, but this was my first time in their North Scottsdale location.  We dropped by for lunch on a Sunday around 11 am.  It was starting to get busy with people showing up to watch football games.  There's plenty of TV's throughout the bar, dining room, and patio areas....perfect for watching football.\u000a\u000aAfter browsing the menu, we ordered:\u000a\u000aO-Lineman Burger (Burger Patty slammed between 2 Grilled Cheese Sandwiches), $14\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cold-beers-and-cheeseburgers-scottsdale?select=HzI9n1OxR5CbBpWmEOpyOQ#HzI9n1OxR5CbBpWmEOpyOQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cold-beers-and-cheeseburgers-scottsdale?select=sA0zZbBfpjzszeejtS7Tkw#sA0zZbBfpjzszeejtS7Tkw\u000a\u000aPrime Rib Sliders, $12\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cold-beers-and-cheeseburgers-scottsdale?select=Z0ntlX976Cu26SoDT72d0w#Z0ntlX976Cu26SoDT72d0w\u000a\u000aOpen Pit Burger, $12\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cold-beers-and-cheeseburgers-scottsdale?select=4SuLfJfnGNk4DkYfwT5ZVw#4SuLfJfnGNk4DkYfwT5ZVw\u000a\u000aHot and Smokey Mac n Cheese, $12\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cold-beers-and-cheeseburgers-scottsdale?select=uzjQ397lgcf3lgwwRTarrQ#uzjQ397lgcf3lgwwRTarrQ\u000a\u000aKiddo had the O-Lineman Burger, which was massive!  He's a growing boy though and easily man-handled it.  He loved it.\u000a\u000aI had the Open Pit Burger...it had a lot of flavor.  The BBQ Sauce complimented the Burger well.\u000a\u000aMom had the Prime Rib Sliders....she really enjoyed them too.\u000a\u000aWe all split a side of Hot & Smokey Mac n Cheese....the diced Jalapeos that were mixed into it gave it a nice spicy bite....yum!  It's a healthy portion that can easily be shared between 2 or 3 people.\u000a\u000aService here was so/so....I had to flag down the server to refill my Beer glass....food came out hot and fast and our orders were taken right after we sat down....it was the refills that were problematic.\u000a\u000aOverall, I like this location.  It's more laid back than the Old Town location, which is more of a party atmosphere.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

The Stuffed Pizza Rolls are unlike anything I've ever had....they're like little Pizza Burritos.  \u000a\u000aI get the personal sized Pizza on occasion and it's just the right size for my appetite.  I get it well done.  They serve it on a little rack so the Crust doesn't get soggy....genius!\u000a\u000aThe Quattro Formaggio Pasta is what I get when I'm super hungry....it's very rich and filling.  Unless you bring a big appetite, plan to bring home a box if you order this dish.\u000a\u000aThe servers here are super nice.  They remember us and know that we enjoy a glass of Wine or 4 when we have dinner, so they offer up a glass immediately.  One server already knows and brings out the glass when she greets us....oh yeah!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 98%

VI recently tried to visit one of my favorite places is Old Town Scottsdale and discovered it's Closed!  NOOOOO!!!!  I will forever remember their awesome Pickles....dammit, where will I be able to get my fix on those now?!  Oh well, they had an awesome bar menu.  This hotel/location has been saddled with poor results for a very long time....too bad, it was a solid hidden gem.  A sample of the menu items I tried here is below in case they reopen it....\u000a\u000aDuck Fat Fries, $5\u000aOld Town Burger, $14\u000aHerb Cherry Tomato Pickles, $6\u000aTruffled Cauliflower Pickles, $7\u000aTater Tots, $5\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 0% (Bummer)

VLocated near the Sands Expo Center, this restaurant gets very busy during conventions.  That's why we decided to have an early lunch on the day we dined here.

It comes with Pretzel Bread, which makes this Sandwich unique and delish.  There's a healthy serving of Ham too as you can see from the pic I took.....it really should be called a "Chicken and Ham" Sandwich.\u000a\u000aMy colleagues had the Prime Rib French Dip and the Burger....they both said it was awesome.\u000a\u000aThe best part of our dining experience was our server.

VFor my 1400th review, I've chosen a very cool, hip spot in Old Town Scottsdale.  The prices here are for upscale Mexican food and are steep, so don't expect a deal.  However, what you can expect is a different take on old classics served in a hipster environment.  I met a colleague here for dinner and I ordered:\u000a\u000aGuacamole, $10.75\u000a\u000aVasito de Elote (Grilled Corn, Butter, Mayo, Cotija Cheese, Tapatio Salsa, Cilantro, Lime), $5\u000a\u000aCarne Asada Burrito, $15\u000a\u000aMargaritas, $6\u000a\u000aThe Guacamole i served table-side and is very good.  It's rich, so if you're not sharing it, order the half portion.  The Carne Asada Burrito is also very good.  When I asked the server "What's a specialty here that I must try?", he said the Vasito de Elote...which is a Grilled Corn appetizer.  I followed his lead and tried it...it's amazing!  A rainbow of flavors explode on your taste buds when you eat it....Sweet, Buttery, Tangy, with a little Spice...yum!\u000a\u000aThe Margaritas here rock.  Very tasty...I think I put down 5 or 6, I can't remember.  Good thing I wasn't driving.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a very good experience.  It's definitely on my rotation to take clients and colleagues.  The only downside to this place is the parking.  Parking is no bueno, but that's a problem everywhere in Old Town Scottsdale.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

VWhat a surprise!  This place is pretty darn good.  When a colleague called me up to go to lunch and said "hey, let's go to Grassroots", my immediate response was "dude, that's not one of those healthy vegan places is it? because I don't like those kind of restaurants".....he laughed and said "trust me, this is your kind of place".....he was right.\u000a\u000aWe met around 11:30 am for lunch and the parking lot in the shopping center it's in was jam packed.  When it's mid-day in Arizona, the last thing you want to do is park far away from the restaurant and walk in dress clothes to/from your car....it's too hot.  In this case, I had to park really far away in the parking garage.  The parking situation gets 1 Star.\u000a\u000aThe food and service on the other hand gets a solid 4 Stars.  I decided to go with the Smoked BBQ Beef Brisket Sandwich w/Fries, $13.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grassroots-kitchen-and-tap-scottsdale?select=Fd9b4bUF72Anw5bE3sFiZA#Fd9b4bUF72Anw5bE3sFiZA\u000a\u000aI immediately fell in love with the Sandwich after 1 bite.  The Cole Slaw that was put on top of the Brisket was the perfect compliment....this thing is full of flavor.  However, it was messy...I don't recommend it for a business lunch.....I am trying to stop ordering messy menu items during business lunches, but for some reason I can't stop.  Good thing I didn't get any on me.\u000a\u000aOur server was attentive and friendly.  Despite the joint being packed for lunch and crazy busy, she was able to ensure we were well taken care of.\u000a\u000aTip - Ask for a table away from the front door.  There are several tables near the front door and we sat at one of them.  Since it's so busy, there are 2 things about those tables that are bad....the constant opening of the door lets in the 400 degree convection oven air from the Sonoran Desert and it's very hard to stay cool....the other thing is that when people wait for their table, they're almost on top of you.\u000a\u000aThat said, next visit we'll sit in the back.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 85%

VWalking from Mandalay Bay to the Luxor, we were hungry and saw this Pizza place.  There are two options, sit-down or quick "order by the slice" counter seating/to go.  We decided to stop by the quick side and order a couple of slices to dine at the counter.\u000a\u000aIt's a typical "order by the slice" joint....you select your Pizza slice and they re-heat it and call your number to pick it up.  We ordered 2 slices of Cheese Pizza.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/slice-of-vegas-las-vegas?select=e7il4LoTHrBJ4bjvybT2CA#e7il4LoTHrBJ4bjvybT2CA\u000a\u000aIt didn't take too long for the Pizza to be ready.  The Pizza itself was forgettable though.  It was a little Salty and lacked flavor beyond the Salt.  The Crust was a bit like cardboard, very tough.....there's a difference between chewy and tough....I like chewy, but dislike "tough" dough.\u000a\u000aOverall, we felt like we wasted calories.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 10%

VThis place is always packed.  Of course it's normally full of guys looking at the TnA that their known for.  To me, that kind of stuff doesn't matter.  However, this place is always at the top of the list when colleagues want to meet up for afterwork drinks.\u000a\u000aA highlight of some of the items I've ordered here:\u000a\u000aChips & Queso\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BgTFsq79xmnRkX0gA1za1Q?select=Y_MkEfV_dZ_-Yw7pYTbk7w#Y_MkEfV_dZ_-Yw7pYTbk7w\u000a\u000aMozzarella Cheese Sticks\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BgTFsq79xmnRkX0gA1za1Q?select=OktAQMHD9Wh2iPh2ZkmEjg#OktAQMHD9Wh2iPh2ZkmEjg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BgTFsq79xmnRkX0gA1za1Q?select=FUjWWxUEC3H_amfkNBUgfg#FUjWWxUEC3H_amfkNBUgfg\u000a\u000aBurger\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BgTFsq79xmnRkX0gA1za1Q?select=-NdNiCM2OQQraB8rVzuJ9g#-NdNiCM2OQQraB8rVzuJ9g\u000a\u000aCheeseburger\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BgTFsq79xmnRkX0gA1za1Q?select=pClRyNnl_14wcjKTvCI97Q#pClRyNnl_14wcjKTvCI97Q\u000a\u000aTwin Peaks Sundae\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BgTFsq79xmnRkX0gA1za1Q?select=Ij4QKzBbG4aiYfm4hxI3gQ#Ij4QKzBbG4aiYfm4hxI3gQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BgTFsq79xmnRkX0gA1za1Q?select=XmAfjb4_07p3TN8x7dAaTA#XmAfjb4_07p3TN8x7dAaTA\u000a\u000aThe Chips & Queso are very good...and addicting.  The Cheese Sticks and Burger are so/so.  The Cheeseburger is average.  The Twin Peaks Sundae is huge and very good...the highlight of their Dessert Menu.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's an average place to me.  The TnA factor doesn't do anything for me at all....as a married guy, to me it's pointless.  Most of the girls are super young and are "faking" it when they come up to your table, so to me it doesn't add to the experience at all.  If that's your deal, this place is for you.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

VWe stumbled across this joint because of Groupon and found a nice home to watch football games, shoot pool, and at one point play darts.  The big deal is that they had the Pac 12 Network here, so we could watch all of the Pac 12 games all season long.  They no longer have the dart machine, which is a major bummer....but the food is great.  The owner is originally from Chicago and boy do I love Chi-town food!\u000a\u000aHere's a few of the menu items we've had here:\u000a\u000aPizza Puff\u000a\u000aItalian Beef Sandwich\u000a\u000aPizza\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sports-grill-101-scottsdale?select=stYoZF-lpKxKkoYaAR7H4Q#stYoZF-lpKxKkoYaAR7H4Q\u000a\u000aNachos\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sports-grill-101-scottsdale?select=7xuYCkVon4E5M4y0_djsmg#7xuYCkVon4E5M4y0_djsmg\u000a\u000aGarlic Knots\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sports-grill-101-scottsdale?select=31Ry-jyqVvm9KbBsVFlGqw#31Ry-jyqVvm9KbBsVFlGqw\u000a\u000aBy far, my favorite items are the Italian Beef Sandwich, Pizza, and of course the Pizza Puff.  The Italian Beef w/Giardinere is simply awesome.  The Pizza very good....thin crust and crispy, I order it Well Done.  The Pizza Puff is the legit ILTaco brand, which reminds me of the Windy City.\u000a\u000aThe employees here are super friendly and will try to accomodate you if you want to change a TV to watch your team play.\u000a\u000aLike I said, the only bummer is that they removed the dart machine....we enjoyed playing darts there from time to time.  Doesn't matter, we'll be back.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

VA few colleagues at work told me about this place.  After hearing about it for several months, I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did.  They have FREE WiFi here, which surprised me.  They also have patio seating and one of those new Coke machines that has a ton of flavors....the kind that you find in Five Guys Burgers.  I like those machines because you can get a variety of Coke Zero flavors.  I love Coke Zero, but it's damn hard to find in restaurants.\u000a\u000aSome items I've sampled here:\u000a\u000aBean and Cheese Burrito, Regular $3.35\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/americas-taco-shop-scottsdale?select=0JU25g8PgSIPYiZxDdjbAw#0JU25g8PgSIPYiZxDdjbAw\u000a\u000aAl Pastor Burrito, Regular $5.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/americas-taco-shop-scottsdale?select=O8QF__8FWHj6MODZax5duA#O8QF__8FWHj6MODZax5duA\u000a\u000aCarne Asada Burrito, Large $7.99\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/americas-taco-shop-scottsdale?select=VAyveM7JLoJRRBBXZbVWMg#VAyveM7JLoJRRBBXZbVWMg\u000a\u000aThe Bean & Cheese Burrito is fantastic....easily one of the best I've ever had.  I think it's because they make it Lard-Free.  Also, the Cheese they put in the Burrito is addicting....I don't know what it is, but it's got me good.\u000a\u000aThe Al Pastor Burrito has a unique taste to it.  It's unlike any Al Pastor I've ever had.  It's a lot drier than I'm used to and it's kind of crunchy....I wonder if they grill or fry it before they put in in the Burrito?  It's definitely unique and good, but don't expect a traditional Al Pastor if you order it otherwise you might be disappointed.\u000a\u000aThe Carne Asada Burrito was just average to me.  I was expecting more from it, but it just didn't blow me away.  I might have to give it another try just to make sure, but I can't stop ordering the Bean & Cheese or Al Pastor Burritos, so I don't know if I will give it a 2nd chance....LOL\u000a\u000aThey have a variety of bottled Hot Sauce options on the table, but lack a Salsa bar....wish they had that.  The bottled Hot Sauce options are very good though.  The green stuff will kick your heiny, but is very good.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/americas-taco-shop-scottsdale?select=GlYesCsPJSqwBgVlsx1vLQ#GlYesCsPJSqwBgVlsx1vLQ\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

After browsing the menu, we ordered:\u000a\u000aSpring Rolls\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pho-cao-tempe-2?select=lUd3JVjBaaHNThXiRBWV5w#lUd3JVjBaaHNThXiRBWV5w\u000a\u000aPho Tai Chin (Lean Rare Steak, Well-done Brisket), $8\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pho-cao-tempe-2?select=Kb4rBGIA6-qis_DffjERXg#Kb4rBGIA6-qis_DffjERXg\u000a\u000aThe Spring Rolls were ok.  They were cooked properly with a nice, crisp shell.  However, they lacked flavor....were kind of bland.\u000a\u000aThe Pho Tai Chin was not good.  The noodles were clumped together at the bottom of the broth....hmmm, that means they were sitting around a while and then hot broth was poured on top of it.  It too lacked flavor.  Also, the Brisket was tough, not tender.  The Lean Rare Steak was good though.\u000a\u000aThe Wine was cheap and was also of poor quality.\u000a\u000aOverall, this place was very disappointing.  The search for quality Pho in Phoenix continues....\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 10%

VWe had a gift card for the Columbia Sportswear outlet and came here to spend it.  Columbia gear is awesome, but premium priced.  We spent a while looking for something to purchase with our $100 gift card.  We settled on a long sleeved shirt that was on the sale rack for $65 and a couple of hats for $25 ea....yep, we spent a little more than the gift card, but that was to be expected.  I wanted to get a jacket, but it was $165 and I had to remind myself that living in the Sonoran Desert, I would never wear it....LOL.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

It's also very filling.  I don't recommend getting it as an appetizer unless you have 3 or 4 people.  If you eat two pieces of it, you'll be full.\u000a\u000aThe Hickory Smoked Wings are very good...and addicting.  They have a sharp, smoky flavor and the Meat is moist and holds the flavor well.  I highly recommend trying these.\u000a\u000aThe Rueben is pure heaven.  They use Marbled Rye here, which is my favorite.\u000a\u000aOverall, this place does a good job.

VWe stopped by for lunch before our road trip back to Scottsdale.  We're fans of Bahn Mi Sandwiches and wanted to get our fix.  We ordered:\u000a\u000a#5 Grilled Pork\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lees-sandwiches-henderson?select=94M3Zyxps_B-BpDl_G2Gqg#94M3Zyxps_B-BpDl_G2Gqg\u000a\u000a#6 BBQ Pork\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lees-sandwiches-henderson?select=WEkvKluos1CxxFSZ-suOYw#WEkvKluos1CxxFSZ-suOYw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lees-sandwiches-henderson?select=zjU5e04WoXWqbMTR0VOJqA#zjU5e04WoXWqbMTR0VOJqA\u000a\u000aI had the BBQ Pork, which was good but the Pork was a little dry.  I love the pickled Vietnamese veggies that are on the Sandwich....as well as the Cilantro and Jalapeno....that's what makes these so good in my opinion.  The Baguette was perfect....nothing like good bread to make a Sandwich.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a good lunch....would've scored higher if the Pork wasn't dry.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 75%

VThis is a decent place to grab a quick bite to eat at The Venetian.  You can buy whole Pizzas or Pizza by the Slice.

The Pizza is pretty average....not the best or worst I've ever had.  It's kind of expensive though....$8 for 2 Slices.\u000a\u000aI'd come back if I was hungry and on the run...but it's not a destination place for me.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VSOL is one of our favorite casual restaurants in the Scottsdale Quarter shopping area.  It's located on the North end of the Quarter, so I recommend parking in the North Garage.  \u000a\u000aThey're known for their Tacos...and they deliver the goods!  Some of the menu items I've had here are:\u000a\u000aNaked Guacamole (Hass Avocado, Cilantro, Lime, Onion, Serrano, Tomato), $8.75\u000a\u000aChorizo and Mushrooms con Queso (Chorizo, Mushrooms, 3 Mexican Cheeses, Serrano & Scallions), $12.50\u000a\u000aStreet Taco Flight (2 each Carne Asada, Carnitas, Chicken Tacos), $18\u000a\u000aVampiro Taco (Cheese, Serrano Chile, Scallions,  Carne Asada, Guacamole, Pico, Chipotle Sauce, Cotixa Cheese), $6.75\u000a\u000aTaco Buffalada (Chicken, Carne Asada, Carnitas, Cheese, Onion, Guacamole, Pico, Radish), $6.50\u000a\u000a3 Carne Asada Tacos, $14.50\u000a\u000a3 Carnitas Tacos, $13.00\u000a\u000aMy favorite out of all of the Tacos is the Vampiro Taco.  It's full of flavor and has a unique taste to it.  The Buffalada Taco is a close second....although I think mixing all of those Meats together on one Taco is a bit much.  Their traditional street Tacos (Carne Asada/Carnitas) are very good, but I prefer eating those from a hole in the wall Mexican restaurant.\u000a\u000aTheir appetizers are very good too.  The Naked Guacamole is amazing, so is the Chorizo and Mushrooms con Queso.  Those two can fill you up though, so don't order too much food if you decide to go with one of those apps.\u000a\u000aThe service here is so/so.  When it gets busy, the attentiveness of the servers declines....and this place gets very busy, especially at dinner time and happy hour.  Whenever it's busy, we have to wave down our servers to keep our glasses full, order more Wine, etc.\u000a\u000aThe vibe here is pretty cool too.  When the weather is great, the patio is a nice place to be.  However, when it gets hot and the misters turn on, it can be a bit too much.  The misters on the patio pump out a lot of water....too much in my opinion.  It's kind of funny because it looks like a tropical rainforest when they turn on the misters in the middle of the Summer heat....there's a massive "fog" and it can get you a bit soaked.  I joked about it with a bartender one night and he said that the misters are controlled by the shopping mall and not by the individual businesses, so they have no control over it.  Oh well, it makes for great people watching.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

VWas in Vegas for a week and needed some snacks for our room.  We were in the area and stopped by this location to grab a few items.  It's gone downhill from what I remember from my last visit many years ago.  The store has aged a lot and the clientele is somewhat sketchy....a function of the surrounding area going downhill over the years as well.\u000a\u000aOverall, the store provided what we needed.  Nothing more, nothing less.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 20%

VThanks to Groupon we found this place.  It was pouring rain so we opted to dine in.  There's a large patio available for dining outside during better weather.  After we browsed the menu, we ordered:\u000a\u000a2 Bruschetta, (Roasted Peppers, Goat Cheese, Tomato Jam) & (Proscuitto, Figs, Mascarpone Cheese, Red Pepper Jam), $6.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/humble-pie-scottsdale-2?select=ET1UiS66hd9cNppzO9hkQw#ET1UiS66hd9cNppzO9hkQw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/humble-pie-scottsdale-2?select=R55kRv_cMo9Soo98eZHeqg#R55kRv_cMo9Soo98eZHeqg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/humble-pie-scottsdale-2?select=bGwF8py_LT4wZCUMMna1fA#bGwF8py_LT4wZCUMMna1fA\u000a\u000aWedge Salad, $8.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/humble-pie-scottsdale-2?select=HE8WeFqH0Vz2eftaXi_y6g#HE8WeFqH0Vz2eftaXi_y6g\u000a\u000aPepperoni Pizza, $12.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/humble-pie-scottsdale-2?select=T_VI9dF5y2oaFobIVzQ7uA#T_VI9dF5y2oaFobIVzQ7uA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/humble-pie-scottsdale-2?select=biSkT_oMxGcDNMmmuWVdBQ#biSkT_oMxGcDNMmmuWVdBQ\u000a\u000aRosenblum Zinfandel, $7.50\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/humble-pie-scottsdale-2?select=GE9jElKmLKS726kjjOB25Q#GE9jElKmLKS726kjjOB25Q\u000a\u000aThe server didn't take notes during the order and didn't remember to put in that I wanted the Wedge Salad to come out with the Bruschetta.  So what happens?  They bring it out with the Pizza.  When I mentioned it to the runner, she said "It wasn't input that way" and walked off...no apology, ok.  I don't know why servers don't take notes...whenever a server stands there and tries to memorize our order, I know it will end up screwed up 80% of the time....they'll forget a detail or two.  Write it down and get it right!\u000a\u000aSo the service here is less than stellar.  Good thing the food is good.  The Proscuitto, Figs, and Mascarpone Cheese Bruschetta is awesome...full of flavor.  The Roasted Pepper Bruschetta is a little bland though, so I'd pass on that next time.\u000a\u000aThe Wedge Salad is very good and the portion size is perfect for a starter dish....I don't know why that server thought I wanted it as an entree...I don't look like a small Salad entree type guy.  \u000a\u000aThe Pizza is pretty good....above average.  The ingredients are fresh and the Crust is cooked just right when we ordered well done.\u000a\u000aOverall, this place has 3.5 to 4 Stars for the food.  2 Stars for the service.  Will have to come back and see if it improves.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 75%

We went there tonight for dinner and *BAM*, there was a notice on the door that the place was being repossessed by the property owner.  It's CLOSED.

VHungry for lunch during a recent trip to Vegas, I found this place using the Yelp App.  It's not in a good area of Las Vegas, but it is relatively new in a nice building.  After browsing the menu and chatting with the talkative cashier, I decided to order the Double Bacon Cheeseburger combo w/Fries and Large Soda, $9.93.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mega-toms-burgers-north-las-vegas?select=zHrIN1vHvJqa4HaSS9z5nw#zHrIN1vHvJqa4HaSS9z5nw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mega-toms-burgers-north-las-vegas?select=KqWlebWdZjsGJ7JyAnoMNg#KqWlebWdZjsGJ7JyAnoMNg\u000a\u000aIt took a little while for them to make the Burger, which is a good sign.  They brought it out to my table and I dug into it.  The Burger was pretty good, not bad.  Fries were OK.  Overall, I'd rate it 3.5 Stars but I'm rounding up because of the friendly staff here.  They were all pretty cool and helpful.  I'd come back to try their Mega Burger...wasn't that hungry that day.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VThe former Fitzgerald's casino, the new owner renovated it to look like an old school Vegas joint.  Complete with a section of a machines on the 2nd floor that operate on coins, they did a pretty good job with the design of the place.  One of the signature features is a giant bar down on the first floor just inside the entrance...pretty cool place to hang out and grab a drink.\u000a\u000aThe casino's first floor has a lot of energy and attracts a younger age demographic than most of the other casinos on Fremont St.  It feels like a house party.  It's 100x better than the old Fitzgerald's, kudos to the owners for taking a chance and renovating it!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 75%

They don't cook them crispy here, the skin is a little 'rubbery'....flavor is good though.  I think if they cooked them longer it would be better...just my opinion though.\u000a\u000aTheir best items are the Sandwiches....Burger, BBQ Pork, and Prime Rib are all very good.  The BBQ Pork is topped with Cole Slaw and is full of flavor....that was my favorite out of the 3.\u000a\u000aThe Nachos were "meh"....tasted like Nachos from a Stadium.....not much there, very plain and below average.\u000a\u000aThe service here is below average.  Every visit, we came around 6-7 pm when it was slow and the bartender was serving us.  She took our order, etc and that was fine....but I had to walk up to the bar to ask for re-fills on our Water, Wine, and Beer....no bueno.  I get it, this is a dive-bar type place and all they cater to that younger, partier who doesn't care about regular restaurant service.  That's why I decided to give it 3 Stars....I have to remember where I'm at and manage expectations walking in.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

VThank you for keeping us safe!  I think we can use more Highway Patrol officers on the freeways patrolling the HOV lanes and nailing those violators during rush hour that don't follow the multiple persons in car law.  We also need you to pop the fools who drive 15+ mph LESS than the speed limit and slowing up traffic which causes dangerous situations on the highways.  We know you're trying your best and we appreciate that!  Good job doing it with limited resources.

VWe had one of these in our neighborhood in Vegas.  So I was excited when I saw that they were opening one in our neighborhood here.  One of the things I love about this place is that you get to write down your order on a bag, so that there's a lesser chance of them getting the order wrong.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/which-wich-scottsdale-4?select=1BjXv4STlKTqIl2LgYpHxw#1BjXv4STlKTqIl2LgYpHxw\u000a\u000aI ended up ordering a Regular 7.5" Grinder w/Chips & Soda, $8.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/which-wich-scottsdale-4?select=LcSFYq6moqRwVGnnHRdTaQ#LcSFYq6moqRwVGnnHRdTaQ\u000a\u000aUnlike some of the other reviewers, I think they make a decent Sandwich here.  I realize there are cheaper Sandwich shops, but Which Wich has their own style and flavor.  Their sauces and toppings are better than average and the Bread is very good.  Overall, it's a pretty good meal.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VFound this place because some colleagues wanted to get together for a holiday cocktail party.  Tucked away in Old Town Scottsdale, this place doesn't get as much foot traffic as the entertainment district.  However, in my opinion it's much better than most of those bars.\u000a\u000aThe big deal for me here is their large selection of Craft Beer and Imported Beer.  The specific Beer that made us choose this place is Chimay.  A couple of us wanted to introduce Chimay to our colleagues and this place has more than 1 on the menu....score!  Add to that a warm, living room feel and very friendly employees and you have a winner.  \u000a\u000aI didn't get a chance to sample the food, but I will on my next trip.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 97%

VAfter reading the yelp reviews from last year's BBQ festival and talking to some of the people who actually worked in some of the booths, I decided to try it for myself this year.  Here's a breakdown of my visit:\u000a\u000a+ Parking is free.  They may have charged for it in the past, but it was free this year.  The only downside is that you park in a dirt lot....good thing I have a monthly membership to Clean Freak, which is a few blocks away.\u000a\u000a+ Rule #1 for attending festivals.....Get. There. Early.  If you want to avoid massive lines, don't go in the middle of the day.  I got there shortly after 11 am and there were no problems getting in.  Conversely, a friend of mine screwed around all morning and didn't get to the festival until 2 pm....by then, it was jam packed and the lines were long....meanwhile, I got to sample all of the BBQ I wanted and was very happy.\u000a\u000a+ The VIP ticket is worth it.  It was nice to have a VIP area where the booze was free.  The VIP area also had tables and chairs for eating, a covered area to get out of the sun, several BBQ stations surrounding it, so there was easy access to food....it's just a better experience.\u000a\u000a+ Don't buy your tickets from the ticket booth near the front entrance.  A very long line forms here.  If you go towards the rear of the festival, the lines are shorter.\u000a\u000a+ My strategy was to go to the vendors with the most popular vendors with the longest lines first, then go to the shorter lines.  It worked just fine.  It would've worked better if my friend arrived on time with me....then we could've tag teamed the lines so that we ordered for each other and cut our wait time in 1/2.\u000a\u000a+ Put on plenty of sunblock.  Although the event was in the middle of April, there was plenty of sun and you could easily get burned if you don't protect yourself.\u000a\u000a+ Check out the Redneck Games.  I went over there to watch people play a variety of games that have a "redneck" spin on it....i.e. corn hole, Beer pong, playing horseshoes with toilet seats, lawnmower racing, etc....although I don't know why Beer pong and corn hole are considered redneck?  It was hilarious to watch.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/az-bbq-festival-scottsdale?select=UWYgAyHVCi6HeZ7qEQ2BvQ#UWYgAyHVCi6HeZ7qEQ2BvQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/az-bbq-festival-scottsdale?select=dTXySc9xbYi_ITpuxaAU6g#dTXySc9xbYi_ITpuxaAU6g\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/az-bbq-festival-scottsdale?select=RodxBoepQoWc0XMo1Lzd4Q#RodxBoepQoWc0XMo1Lzd4Q\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/az-bbq-festival-scottsdale?select=eFomOTLmWAahjTituvPjsg#eFomOTLmWAahjTituvPjsg\u000a\u000a+ As far as the food, it was awesome!  There was a great selection of vendors and BBQ from across the country was well represented.....Memphis, Texas, Carolinas, Kansas City, St Louis, all of the major style of BBQ was in one place....only 1 problem.....my stomach isn't large enough for them all!  Even though I went for the sample sized portions, I could only sample so much....I tried to eat as much as I could and didn't get to 1/2 of the vendors....which means I can't wait until next time!\u000a\u000aOverall, this event is fun for the family or for the individual.  I am glad I got to experience it for myself.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 97%

VI had a morning meeting downtown and a colleague and I needed a place to strategize over breakfast.  He suggested this place.  \u000a\u000aAfter a quick look at the menu, I decided on a Buckwheat Belgian Waffle w/Vermont Maple Syrup, $12.  To wash it down, I ordered a Coffee and Water.\u000a\u000aThe server brought out a mini-pot of Coffee so that we could refill our cups at our leisure...bonus, I like when a restaurant offers that.  After a short wait our food was served.\u000a\u000aI poured a little Syrup on my Waffle and took a bite....it was a little disappointing.  The texture was good and it was cooked just right...however, the flavor fell flat for me.  It tasted too "grainy"....not in the rough texture sense, but in the bitter, wild grains sense.  It wasn't what I expected....even the Syrup couldn't save it.  I only ate 1/2 of the Waffle.  Looking back on it, I'd like to try it with an IPA....it might go well with a bitter Beer like that and I love IPA's.  That would be weird though, ordering a Waffle at breakfast and a tall glass of IPA...ha!\u000a\u000aOur server was great and the place is very well kept.  If I come back, I'll be sure to try something that I'm more familiar with.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor 50%

VAhh, Kelly's....one of our favorite watering holes in Old Town.  We love coming here for happy hour.  They just added Stone IPA on the Beer menu, which is one of my favorites.  \u000a\u000aWe enjoy coming here because it's relatively big and comfortable.  There are large sofas and love seats sprawled through one section of the bar, so there's plenty of room to relax.  The bar top is very wide, so there's plenty of room for your drinks and food.  There's even an outdoor area when the weather is nice....something for everyone.  That's why we like to come here....very few complaints from our clients and colleagues when we choose to meet up here.\u000a\u000aWill have to try the food one day.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VThanks to Groupon, we found this place.  It's located in North Phoenix, tucked away in a small complex with condos and a few stores....no way we would have stumbled upon this place if it wasn't for Groupon.  It's located on "High St".....LMAO (if you don't get it, you never will)\u000a\u000aThe decor of the place reminds me of Scooby Doo....must be the 70's "groovy" Mushroom style.

There's too many toppings on the Pizza.  I like my Pizza well done, which is what we ordered, but because it has a ton of toppings, the Pizza was still very wet & soggy.  The flavors of the toppings clashed with each other....too much to handle in my opinion.\u000a\u000aThe Mighty Meaty is much better.  The flavor of each of the Meats stands out and tastes well together.  It's a much better Pizza than the House Special if you like your Pizza well done.\u000a\u000aThe service here was hit/miss.  One visit, it was outstanding....the next visit, it was a little slow and we had to wave down our server.\u000a\u000aIf it was closer to our house, we'd probably visit more often.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VThanks to Groupon I found this place.  It's relatively new to Old Town, just opening around a year ago (guess)?  Anyway, I've been meaning to try it, but until the Groupon deal came out, I just didn't seem to find time to do so.  \u000a\u000aI like Q'doba restaurant...very familiar.

It's soooo good and addicting.  The Chips are ok...what more could you ask from Chips, right?\u000a\u000aThe employees who work here are friendly and got our order right.  Since they're in Old Town, they have a lot of competition for food joints.  I hope they make it.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

VI was recently invited to play in a celebrity golf tournament at this course.  It was a lot of fun.  There are three 18 hole courses to play.  We played on the Heritage Course, which is 6,852 yds from the Men's Championship tees and 6,291 from the Men's Club tees.  \u000a\u000aIt's fun traditional course that's very flat with large trees, a little water, and medium difficulty rough.  It's not a typical desert course.  If you spray your shot here, you have a very good chance to find it....unless you hit it into a residence.\u000a\u000aThe day we played, the greens and fairways were in great condition.  Overall, it was a fun day of golf.  I'd like to come back and play the other 2 courses.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VWhen I lived in Vegas (up until 2011), this place didn't exist.  We spotted it during our most recent Vegas trip and decided to drop in to check it out.  We were pleasantly surprised to find an awesome store full of antique booths.\u000a\u000aI wandered around browsing the booths for about 1 hour while The Better Half shopped the jewelry cabinets up front.  After 1 hour, she was still in the same area!  That says a lot about the variety of items they have.  She walked away buying several Silver pieces of Southwestern and Native American jewelry.  She then spent another 2 hrs browsing the other booths while I went next door to the casino to watch basketball.  \u000a\u000aWe've added this to our rotation of Antique Stores to visit on a regular.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

VIt's no secret that I love golf.  Since moving to Scottsdale a few years ago, it's been my mission to play the best golf courses in the State.

The course is well kept and drained the water well.

VFor my 1500th review, wanted to review a really good restaurant.  We were lucky enough to stumble across this place recently.  As soon as we saw the menu, we knew we found a slice of Heaven!  We were seated in the back dining room and the server explained that the food was served "tapas style", meaning that whatever was prepared first would come out....therefore, it wasn't your traditional appetizer-entree-dessert type setup.  OK, we were good with that.  \u000a\u000aAfter browsing the menu, we ordered:\u000a\u000aFocaccia di Recco (Ligurian style baked Focaccia, Soft Cow Cheese, add local Honeycomb), $16.....this was ridiculously good and filling.  We didn't realize how much food this was and we were only on our 1st item! LOL\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/davanti-enoteca-scottsdale?select=CMqEfDqZuL5MN2mUFHu3iA#CMqEfDqZuL5MN2mUFHu3iA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/davanti-enoteca-scottsdale?select=9AU4B82rUc3OU4veLMM4wA#9AU4B82rUc3OU4veLMM4wA\u000a\u000aCrispy Pork Belly (Cannellini Beans, Pears, Herb Salad, Mostarda Oil)\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/davanti-enoteca-scottsdale?select=GLSn7knJjVec_6i-InJCVQ#GLSn7knJjVec_6i-InJCVQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/davanti-enoteca-scottsdale?select=uR9-jw6YoGyc1-GxLQnBxg#uR9-jw6YoGyc1-GxLQnBxg\u000a\u000aRoasted Cauliflower Steak (Sicilian Olive Tapenade, Marinated Lemon Jam)\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/davanti-enoteca-scottsdale?select=JYfa2oARQsm3gTJCaqRYoA#JYfa2oARQsm3gTJCaqRYoA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/davanti-enoteca-scottsdale?select=31H6S8pS9enicg1DpjHezA#31H6S8pS9enicg1DpjHezA\u000a\u000aScottadito Style Ribs (Saba, Crushed Hazelnuts, Roman Gorgonzola Dolce Slaw)\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/davanti-enoteca-scottsdale?select=qY5FEUmRb9MPpCdDq9s5sQ#qY5FEUmRb9MPpCdDq9s5sQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/davanti-enoteca-scottsdale?select=_j-Ky2gJN21ylVgt4hkg2A#_j-Ky2gJN21ylVgt4hkg2A\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/davanti-enoteca-scottsdale?select=-ZSL7SFeZ0GOM634ORbzmw#-ZSL7SFeZ0GOM634ORbzmw\u000a\u000aGnocchi di Ricotta (Eggplant, Roasted Tomatoes, Basil, Mozzarella), $15\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/davanti-enoteca-scottsdale?select=5eMwGSFfw4N7gZEDR6tdhg#5eMwGSFfw4N7gZEDR6tdhg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/davanti-enoteca-scottsdale?select=j1ndNZNgfcksxLjA6m5TjQ#j1ndNZNgfcksxLjA6m5TjQ\u000a\u000aPizza D.O.C.

The Focaccia de Recco is absolutely fabulous....and filling!  It's a must-have.  After having the first item come out, we realized that we ordered too much food...but it was too late, so we decided to have a tasting dinner and take some home.\u000a\u000aEverything was full of flavor and had fresh ingredients....our taste buds were going crazy! Besides the Focaccia, my fav's were the Gnocchi, Ribs, and Pizza.  The Cauliflower Steak was very good too, but wow is that a huge portion!  The Pork Belly was also good, but very rich....a good item to share with a group.\u000a\u000aOur server was excellent and attentive all night long.  She helped us select our items and was very friendly.\u000a\u000aThere was only 1 complaint about the evening....we were seated in the back dining room with 1 large group that we think was there for a Wine dinner.  Since they were "talking Wine" and other stuff, they were loud.  The dining room has hard surfaces, there's no fabric or anything there to soften the sound....so needless to say, we heard all about their Wine flight, where it was made, and such and such....they group got louder as they consumed more Wine....that's to be expected.  Next time we go, we'll ask if there's a Wine dinner or large group and kindly ask for another table to avoid it.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 95%

VKiddo came in for his Senior pictures session.  We made an appointment and he went into one of the studio rooms in the back and 15 min later came out.  A few minutes after that they reviewed the various pictures & poses, which came out awesome.  They did a great job!\u000a\u000aThey had the classic gown photo for the yearbook, but they also took a few pics of poses in street clothes. I wasn't going to buy any extra pics, but ended up doing so because they were awesome.  I'd recommend this studio to friends and family.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 85%

It made for a nice meal after a day of golf in the hot sun.  I'm impressed by their selection of Craft Beer and the Racer 5 IPA went down smooth.

VMy Brother-In-Law gets credit for introducing me to this place.  This is a gold mine for slightly defected (scratched or chipped) furniture and appliances.  It's where the returns from their regular retail store end up.  It's tucked away in the warehouse district of North Las Vegas, just off the I-15 freeway.\u000a\u000aMy BIL bought a dining room set and a sofa & love seat here.  The prices are ridiculously low!  If you can live with the fact that it's brand new but with minor defects, then this is the place for you.  Some of the defects were minor and barely detectable.....nothing a little varnish or patchwork can't fix.  To save literally 100's or 1000's of dollars, it's worth it.  Most of the prices are 50-75% Off the retail price.\u000a\u000aI wish I knew about this place 3 yrs ago when we blew our wad on brand new furniture.\u000a\u000a**TIPS** \u000a\u000a- Be prepared to pick up the items yourself.  Delivery is NOT included with your purchase.\u000a\u000a- Everything is sold "As Is", no refunds.  So be sure to check your items BEFORE you leave.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a great place to find awesome furniture deals.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VThanks to Groupon I found this place.  Since I love Italian & Mexican food, I've always wondered what would happen if you mixed the 2 together.  I've dined in various restaurants who have tried to mesh the 2.  This was the first one that I've tried that's tried to do it in the style of a Chipotle....you walk up and 'put together' their version of a Burrito, Bowl, etc.  A Pellini = a Burrito.  Here's what I ordered:\u000a\u000aChicken Pellini (like an Italian Burrito), $6.55\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pellini-italian-eatery-scottsdale?select=ZlAypm0ztBYuLm9yDDKfIg#ZlAypm0ztBYuLm9yDDKfIg\u000a\u000aSpinach Artichoke Dip, $4.25\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pellini-italian-eatery-scottsdale?select=zb3gVJGxAPHV5UZE6aSZXA#zb3gVJGxAPHV5UZE6aSZXA\u000a\u000aBruschetta, $2.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pellini-italian-eatery-scottsdale?select=ch-WNynk3QDA7DxvIMgSjQ#ch-WNynk3QDA7DxvIMgSjQ\u000a\u000aThe Chicken Pellini was pretty good...above average.  However, the sides fell short.  The Spinach Artichoke Dip was bland and the Bruschetta was *meh*....I'd pass on those next time, but since it came with the Groupon I'm glad I got to try it.\u000a\u000aThey also offer Beer & Wine here....which is a plus.  They also have Sriracha and other Hot Sauces to dress up your Pellini if you choose...the Sriracha was a nice touch and complimented the flavor of my Pellini well.\u000a\u000aI can see this catching on.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VFor a quick car wash, I really like this place.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a+ They still use the scrubbing cloths that spin and actually get stuff off your car.  Most quick car washes nowadays only use the water pressure nozzles, which doesn't clean up the dirt and grime real well.\u000a\u000a+ They give you a prewash spray before you enter the car wash.\u000a\u000a+ It's only $5-$10 (depends on wash selection) and then they give you a 50% OFF coupon for your next wash.  So next wash is $2.50 to $5....pretty cool.\u000a\u000a+ It's right off the 101 and Via De Ventura.  Very convenient when driving to/from work.  I can also air dry any leftover drops on the freeway...ha!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VThis joint opened recently and I finally decided to drop in and give it a try.  I've had Jersey Mike's back in Vegas, but this was my first time trying it here in Scottsdale.  I ordered a regular sized #13 Original Italian (Provolone, Ham, Prosciuttini, Cappacuolo, Salami, Pepperoni, $6.95) and Chips ($.99).\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jersey-mikes-subs-scottsdale-2?select=SAsdgro1HjRXZmKcT9oBRQ#SAsdgro1HjRXZmKcT9oBRQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jersey-mikes-subs-scottsdale-2?select=0ej781QrEV60Ea0nrKipFA#0ej781QrEV60Ea0nrKipFA\u000a\u000aThe Sandwich is OK, not great.  It doesn't leave me wanting more.  For me, it lacks something....I can't put my finger on it, but it's just not a great Sandwich to me.\u000a\u000aTIP - The shopping mall where this place is located is very small and parking spaces are limited.  During the lunch hour and on weekends, the parking lot is overloaded and it's a mess to try and park.  \u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VI had a flight to SF that was departing from a gate near this place and wanted to grab a bite before I boarded.  It looked like a cool place and offered some menu items that looked good.  After browsing the menu, I ordered:\u000a\u000aNitro Nachos, $8.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sir-vezas-taco-garage-phoenix?select=b0HbdLhmPl7Lmj8L7E8yJA#b0HbdLhmPl7Lmj8L7E8yJA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sir-vezas-taco-garage-phoenix?select=Snw9oAxwcW-qlb-bUIeASQ#Snw9oAxwcW-qlb-bUIeASQ\u000a\u000aQuesadilla, $6.95 + Peppers, $2\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sir-vezas-taco-garage-phoenix?select=Lualv9KuNGft6MChnGZwpg#Lualv9KuNGft6MChnGZwpg\u000a\u000a1L Water, $3\u000a\u000aThe Nachos were pretty good, but messy.  I had to eat 1/2 of the dish with a fork because the bottom half was soaked in Queso Cheese.  I don't recommend ordering this to take on a plane....it's not plane friendly as you will get messy.\u000a\u000aThe Quesadilla was very interesting.  I ordered it with the Peppers, which was an additional $2....it actually came with Peppers & Onions.  It tasted like an Italian Pepper & Onions Sandwich.....which was good, but unexpected.\u000a\u000aOverall, I thought the food was pretty good for airport food.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 75%

VPopped in here one day while The Better Half was doing some antique shopping down the street. What a lucky day that was! \u000a\u000aI consider myself a Craft Beer enthusiast, not an expert....so don't be too hard on my review. I think this joint just opened in Oct, and it looked very new. \u000a\u000aI browsed the menu board and decided to try:\u000a\u000aBuzz Bomb IPA, $6 pint\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/desert-eagle-brewery-mesa?select=DR5zoM94SO2fH4Y-mRBhrA#DR5zoM94SO2fH4Y-mRBhrA\u000a\u000aPomegranate Wheat, $6 pint\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/desert-eagle-brewery-mesa?select=93i2Y7h5xIkt2mHuPjN25g#93i2Y7h5xIkt2mHuPjN25g\u000a\u000aThey were both awesome, but my fav was the Pomegranate Wheat. I enjoyed it so much that I bought a Growler ($35) for the road.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/desert-eagle-brewery-mesa?select=bclK6U1ybEtZweVHeuylJA#bclK6U1ybEtZweVHeuylJA\u000a\u000aThey don't serve food here, but allow you to bring your own in. There's a Pizza joint next door and a couple of other restaurants nearby in case you get the munchies. If you don't feel like getting off your bar stool, they have Bar Snack Mix for you to munch on....although it won't be enough to fill you up, at least not with an appetite like mine. \u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/desert-eagle-brewery-mesa?select=I6m_-zkwBDWwWBjRwG82Kg#I6m_-zkwBDWwWBjRwG82Kg\u000a\u000aThe staff was super friendly and helpful.

VDuring a recent trip to Vegas, The Better Half scored a nice marble statue at a Goodwill store in Green Valley, so she thought she'd try another store to see if she could find a similar gem.  We stopped by this store to check it out.\u000a\u000aAfter spending an hour in the store, she found a couple of items, but nothing like the statue at the other store.  We found a couple of National Finals Rodeo (NFR) jackets for $7 ea.  These are normally $50-$75 ea at the event.  We like to go to the rodeo every year, so it was a nice find.\u000a\u000aOverall, not a bad day shopping.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VTucked away in the middle of the McDowell Mountain Ranch neighborhood, this Pizza joint is a hidden gem.  We've driven by it dozens of times and finally decided to stop by and give it a try.  It was a Sunday night and there were only a few tables occupied in the restaurant.  After browsing the menu, I spotted a unique item...it's called the Vesuvio.  It's a  1/2 Calzone,  1/2 Pizza concoction....I had to try it.  Additionally, it was happy hour, so Pizza was 1/2 price!  So we ordered:\u000a\u000aPepperoni Pizza, $14 (regular price, happy hour is 1/2 off)\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ciao-grazie-scottsdale?select=BLFokFO1e7C4iph6BcJU7Q#BLFokFO1e7C4iph6BcJU7Q\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ciao-grazie-scottsdale?select=3hFzBESdIbdRZ8zZDx63tg#3hFzBESdIbdRZ8zZDx63tg\u000a\u000aThe Vesuvio (1/2 Calzone, 1/2 Pizza), $16\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ciao-grazie-scottsdale?select=cxvJ6_KDrbbIG4YlrnFdBg#cxvJ6_KDrbbIG4YlrnFdBg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ciao-grazie-scottsdale?select=00i0JtsGG9qUkCIeJTkx-A#00i0JtsGG9qUkCIeJTkx-A\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ciao-grazie-scottsdale?select=itgoHpgq-OCxgkoetT6GYA#itgoHpgq-OCxgkoetT6GYA\u000a\u000aAfter a short wait, we  got our food and I was looking forward to diving into the Vesuvio, so that's what I tried first....I cut a piece of the Calzone and Pizza.  I tried the Calzone portion first....and it was bland....the Dough, Ricotta Cheese, and Ham were good and fresh, but it didn't have a much flavor....I think if there was some Sauce for dipping or if they had Sauce in the Calzone, it would be better.  The Pizza portion of the Vesuvio was awesome...it was a Mushroom/Cheese Pizza.  It had good flavor and was cooked perfectly.  After the 1st bite of the Calzone, I started to combine a piece of the Pizza and a piece of the Calzone together to make it taste good.  Perhaps that's how I should've been eating it from the start...? \u000a\u000aThe Pepperoni Pizza was awesome....full of flavor and the thin crust was cooked perfectly.  \u000a\u000aOverall, we really enjoyed our dinner here.

The Pretzel Knots are amazing!  They came out warm and fresh and have a nice Queso Dip to compliment it.  \u000a\u000aThe Spinach Artichoke Dip was bland...disappointing.  The hard, cruton-like sticks that came with the Dip were very salty...perhaps that's why it tasted so bland to me?\u000a\u000aThe Potato Bacon Chowder was outstanding.....rich and creamy, it hit the spot.\u000a\u000aFor the grand finale, the Rueben came out....and boy was it good!  My colleague ordered the same thing, except he got Onion Rings and I got Fries as a side dish.  The Onion Rings are thick and juicy....and sweet, very good.  The Fries were very good too.\u000a\u000aService here was outstanding....what you'd expect for a 5 Diamond resort.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 91%

VThis location just opened in the past year.  I've had Smashburger before, when I lived in Vegas.  I finally got around to eating at this location.  I decided to order the Arizona Big Smashburger, $6.99 and Fries, $1.99.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smashburger-scottsdale?select=5lRFB7Gm-1U8tkOVjwU25A#5lRFB7Gm-1U8tkOVjwU25A\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smashburger-scottsdale?select=IRp7RymmFmSQng5DDymnGQ#IRp7RymmFmSQng5DDymnGQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smashburger-scottsdale?select=0uFd1V0_r9BfvSJXA96fkA#0uFd1V0_r9BfvSJXA96fkA\u000a\u000aThe Arizona Big Smashburger is pretty good...comes with Guacamole and fresh cut Jalapenos.  It has a nice kick to it....and tastes different than most Burgers you find out there.  The Guacamole is fresh and rich....adds a creamy smooth texture and compliments the sharpness of the Jalapeno.\u000a\u000aThe Fries are average at best.\u000a\u000aThis place gets very busy.  To avoid the crowds, try coming between meal periods.  Also, the parking lot can get nuts here because it's way too small for this shopping center.....I avoid it on the weekends.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 88%

VWow, I'm surprised to read all of the negative reviews about Direct TV.  As a customer of 13+ yrs, my experience has been nothing but fantastic.  Here's why:\u000a\u000a+ They're very prompt in fixing any issues I may have.\u000a\u000a+ Their installation guys always give me several options on placement of dishes, routing of cables, etc before they complete the work.\u000a\u000a+ I've moved twice in the past 5 years and each time, they set me up with a new dish at a cost of only $25.\u000a\u000a+ I've had 2 receivers die on me in the many yrs as a customer and they've replaced them promptly.\u000a\u000a+ Unlike some of the other reviewers, I have my bills set to automatically pay online and I've never had any issues with billing.\u000a\u000a+ When I call the customer service line, I get connected very quickly with a representative.  When they discover that I'm a long term customer, they've waived fees and/or expedited service when needed.\u000a\u000a+ The channel selection is incredible.  How else can you watch all the NFL games all season long, go Cowboys!\u000a\u000a+ Besides the rare occasion during thunder storms, I've never lost reception on a signal.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's been an awesome experience for me.  I can't live without Direct TV and will never use cable or Dish Network.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VThis is a legit foot massage place.  It's not one of "those" places that you don't want to be in.  On a recent trip to Las Vegas, we were tired from walking around the Strip and decided to try a foot massage place on Spring Mountain Rd before we drove back to Phoenix.  We found this joint...they offer massages for $20 per hour, with a $10 tip it's $30 per hour all-in, score!\u000a\u000aThe inside of the place is huge.  It must've been an old furniture store or something like that...plenty of little semi-private areas.  It's not like the places in Chinatown in LA where there are tons of chairs in a big room and no privacy.  We opted to get ours done together so we had an area with 2 chairs.\u000a\u000aThe masseuse perfectly massaged our feet for about 20 minutes and the rest of the time was a regular massage.  That was unexpected, but appreciated.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was an awesome experience.  I wish we had a place like this in the Phoenix area.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VI guess I'm accustomed to the very large Burlington in Vegas.  This location had a very small selection of suits. Overall, the store felt very small to me.  The Vegas store is at least 3 times larger than this one and I left disappointed.\u000a\u000aI was able to find a few dress shirts, but left empty handed without a suit or tie.  On the plus side, this store was very well kept and clean.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VI won some gift certificates at a charity raffle and we decided to drive up to Carefree to use them.  It took us 2 trips to use up the certificates, but it was worth the drive.

I'm a huge fan of Caprese Salad, and they do it very well here.  The Roast Beef Sandwich was very good as well.\u000a\u000aThe service during both visits was very good.  Overall, a good experience.

VI guess the nickname "Wasted Management Open" makes sense for this tournament.  It's got to be the only PGA tournament were more people attend for the non-golf activities than to actually watch golf.  It's an amazing event for sure.  Some observations:\u000a\u000a+ Valet parking is the way to go.  It's near the entrance and although it costs $$$, it is worth every penny in my opinion.  The other lots are too far for my tastes...I'm an impatient guy.  Luckily, I scored a Valet pass.\u000a\u000a+ Be sure you plan to give your liver a rest after the tournament.  If you're going to do this the right way, you'll be drinking like a fish for 4+ days/nights.\u000a\u000a+ The best golf holes to watch in my opinion are 17 and 18.  I like the pin positions on the 17 green and the water hazard surrounding the green makes you pay dearly if you try to hit driver off the tee and go for it in 1.....it's a short Par 4 and it's fun to watch many pros go for it off the tee.  \u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/waste-management-phoenix-open-scottsdale?select=iCtOHGnWFqKSp8S1vfz9Gw#iCtOHGnWFqKSp8S1vfz9Gw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/waste-management-phoenix-open-scottsdale?select=erXOqEtueb9h-gV5vcXBWQ#erXOqEtueb9h-gV5vcXBWQ\u000a\u000a+ For a 1st timer, 16 is a must see.  However, unless you can get in a skybox, it's tough to get in on Saturday and Sunday.  I heard people were waiting since 7 or 8 AM to get in on those days.  Luckily, we were in a skybox.\u000a\u000a+ The Thunder Dog is really good.  Priced at $5, it's a deal.  You can find a Thunderbird stand selling them between Hole 16 and the practice range.  It's worth waiting in line for it.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/waste-management-phoenix-open-scottsdale?select=3LcsrNyLWjcQPFvhem6B3Q#3LcsrNyLWjcQPFvhem6B3Q\u000a\u000a- The Bird's Nest is fun for a first timer.  However, this was my 2nd year going and I didn't have much fun there this year.  It's way too packed and it gets uncomfortable.  Last year, Will.i.am rocked the house.  This year it was Dirks Bentley and Roger Clyne.  Roger Clyne had the entire tent packed...he could have headlined all by himself.  It's way too crowded and full of drunks.  Next year, I will pass on this for sure.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/waste-management-phoenix-open-scottsdale?select=vZZ7fH_yuL7Z-Mg6QigccQ#vZZ7fH_yuL7Z-Mg6QigccQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/waste-management-phoenix-open-scottsdale?select=NWQnPDf8WzWFO1QR4cgiPQ#NWQnPDf8WzWFO1QR4cgiPQ\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a pretty fun scene.

VI've heard about this place from so many friends and colleagues that I had to try it for myself.  So, I head into downtown Phoenix between breakfast/lunch to grab a bite.  I got lucky and found a parking spot in front just down the street....be warned though, it's metered parking and it's an old school meter, so you need quarters & dimes.  I only had enough for 45 min, so I prayed that it wouldn't be packed inside and that I could get in/out without a parking ticket.\u000a\u000aI walked in and found a seat at the bar.  I saddled up to the counter and browsed the menu.  I ended up ordering:\u000a\u000aFive Spot Breakfast Sandwich (Eggs, Cheese, Caramelized Onions, Thick Cut Bacon) w/Hash Browns, $5.95\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-big-breakfast-phoenix-2?select=BnXYQfUHaR_ajW8_Wy5oUA#BnXYQfUHaR_ajW8_Wy5oUA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-big-breakfast-phoenix-2?select=Ky1EPe539GhuY-nM_9J5RA#Ky1EPe539GhuY-nM_9J5RA\u000a\u000aThe order came out fast.  I took one bite and loved it.  It was full of flavor...the Caramelized Onions really added to the taste of this Sandwich, I was impressed.  The Bacon tasted great, but was a little undercooked for my tastes...I should've known better and asked for it to be cooked crispy, especially since it was thick-cut...my bad.  It was till a great Sandwich anyway.  Except for the Caramelized Onions, it's exactly how I'd make a breakfast Sandwich.\u000a\u000aThe Hash Browns were good too, went well with the Sandwich.\u000a\u000aThe service was great, I was in/out in 30 min....so I had 15 min to spare on the meter.  Lunch menu looks interesting, I'll have to come back and give it a try.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VWandered into this casino during a recent trip to Vegas.  It's a very small, locals casino.  A nice variety of Video Poker and Slots to choose from.  Everyone seemed to know each other.  The food here is average.  I had a Burger and Fries.\u000a\u000aThe parking lot was full of cars, so it must be a very popular place.  That's kind of strange because the much larger Sunset Station is next door.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%

VDecided to take a Staycation with The Better Half and saw that the rates for the new HRH Tower at the Hard Rock was $90 per night.....sold!  We booked it online and headed down to get away for a couple of days.  Here are some highlights of our stay:\u000a\u000a- The tower is new and has a ton of room in the suites.  There's a separate bedroom & living room, very spacious.  (see pics)\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oakaMw79ChXM8NllHjgLNg?select=IBebLmeBXfFVUzg5ybHSEA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oakaMw79ChXM8NllHjgLNg?select=NgMh_-U4F58muEyYbyVJjg\u000a\u000a- The beds are very comfortable.  The pillow top mattress is soooo soft we melted into the bed.  We didn't want to wake up in the morning....LOL\u000a\u000a- There is a $15 per day resort fee.  For that you get access to the spa among other amenities.\u000a\u000a- The bathroom is huge!  Large, deep tubs.......large shower with rainfall shower head.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oakaMw79ChXM8NllHjgLNg?select=QRXtpTSeupCvCrnahXg07w\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oakaMw79ChXM8NllHjgLNg?select=RhCKWzs4vQXFtBUv1vE0bg\u000a\u000a- The mini-bar is motion activated.....which means if you take something from it, if it's gone for more than 2 minutes it will automatically be charged to your room.....be careful not to remove anything unless you really want it!\u000a\u000a- The toiletries were awesome.  Soaps & shampoo were good quality.\u000a\u000a- The lobby of the new HRH Tower has a ton of new memorabilia in it....worth checking it out.\u000a\u000aSome QUICK TIPS:\u000a- Parking for the HRH Tower is on the south side of the building.  Park at the parking garage or valet which is off of Harmon.  If you go to the other parking area, it's far from the new tower.\u000a\u000a- You get $10 in FREE Slot Play when you check into the hotel.....use it, it's FREE money.  The Better Half redeemed it but didn't win anything.\u000a\u000aOverall, we had a great time at the Hard Rock.  A nice little staycation in our favorite city!\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VTonight was Grand Opening night.  We were lucky enough to get an invite.  This place rocks.  The footprint of the place is relatively small, but there are large booths (6-10 pp), plenty of space around the bar and patio.  \u000a\u000aThe decor is super cool with one wall full of old-school retro speakers.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hi-fi-kitchen-and-cocktails-scottsdale?select=jt82QozdKG3bDzkiD-zyNQ#jt82QozdKG3bDzkiD-zyNQ\u000a\u000aAnother wall is where the DJ booth is located and a projector showing graphics against the wall.  The sound system is pretty good and there are 29 TV's spread around the place.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hi-fi-kitchen-and-cocktails-scottsdale?select=cwp2gvxYlEM_8BcOfcMPhQ#cwp2gvxYlEM_8BcOfcMPhQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hi-fi-kitchen-and-cocktails-scottsdale?select=eZWDjH5-LRo2j1sBgTJxPQ#eZWDjH5-LRo2j1sBgTJxPQ\u000a\u000aThe ceiling above the bar has a cool mural that has glow in the dark features with a black light that shows off those attributes.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hi-fi-kitchen-and-cocktails-scottsdale?select=A7k1SH4dgk5UnXNulaE2jg#A7k1SH4dgk5UnXNulaE2jg\u000a\u000aThe spot is across the street from El Hefe and Majerle's.  The amount of foot traffic they will get on the weekends will be tremendous.  This should be a winner.\u000a\u000aWe had a few comp drinks and left after a little while....it got crowded and we ran out of room to hang out.  I couldn't judge the service because we didn't stick around long enough and everyone is new.  The bartenders at the bar were fast in filing everyone's order and keeping up with the rush.\u000a\u000aWe will definitely come back to check it out on a weekend night.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VI am a big fan of Jimmy Johns.  Their Sandwiches are awesome and they make them fast.  After a day of golf, we stopped by here to grab a bite to eat.

VThis is one of the best nightclubs I've seen in a very long time.  They did a great job with the design of the club, especially the light and sound.  We were there on 4/26 to see Deadmau5.  We reserved a booth on the 2nd floor overlooking the main room...it was amazing!  The laser/light show was perfectly suited for the music and done very well.  From our vantage point, it was exceptional.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hakkasan-night-club-las-vegas?select=PbJCoYtRwa-BHFOatI8CnQ#PbJCoYtRwa-BHFOatI8CnQ\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hakkasan-night-club-las-vegas?select=jRPS0hDzWjGVfmbPHsSPWA#jRPS0hDzWjGVfmbPHsSPWA\u000a\u000aWe setup the booth well in advance and it was easy for us to get in.  It's a mega-nightclub in Vegas, you have to expect to wait if you don't have things setup in advance....it cracks me up to read the reviews complaining about the lines, etc.\u000a\u000aThe bottles were reasonable....Magnum of Patron & Goose for $950.  Our VIP server was very accommodating and attentive, keeping our mixers full and replenishing our bottles when they emptied.  We had 16+ people in our booth, so the alcohol was being consumed pretty fast.  I have no idea what the final damage was for the evening....well over $5000.\u000a\u000aNow for the music....Deadmau5 was simply amazing.  He came on around 1 am and tore it up.  There wasn't a bad spot in the club....the club is engineered well and the bass/highs/mids were perfect throughout.  I didn't want the night to end, it was that good.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hakkasan-night-club-las-vegas?select=xfz96V7lzRzWXE4wzk9Tqg#xfz96V7lzRzWXE4wzk9Tqg\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hakkasan-night-club-las-vegas?select=GPf9-lJThUsatjt38jNOFA#GPf9-lJThUsatjt38jNOFA\u000a\u000a1 level below the main floor, there's a Hip Hop lounge and a Hip Hop room.  We did wander there for a little while to check it out before Deadmau5 came on.  The lounge was dead....only 5 or 6 people there.  That was strange....I bet they change the format of the music within a week or two.  The main Hip Hop room was jammed packed.  It too was well engineered for sound and lights.  I like how they put it in the center of the room and there's a walkway that goes around the perimeter...it makes for easy people watching and access to the main floor.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hakkasan-night-club-las-vegas?select=hwrokLedZcWP7zV_Zid10w#hwrokLedZcWP7zV_Zid10w\u000a\u000aOverall, I rate this place 5 Stars and can't wait to come back as long as they continue to have great DJ's.\u000a\u000aTip:  Don't park at the MGM Grand.  It's 1000x easier to park at the Tropicana Hotel valet and walk over....seriously.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VLocated inside the Tropicana hotel in Vegas, this is a great place to grab a quick bite.

They tried though.....but it was still very "doughy" and soft....blazing hot though, I had to give it a few min to cool off.\u000a\u000aThe flavor of the Pizza was OK....the Cheese overwhelmed it a bit.  The Pepperoni was quite small too.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a pretty average Slice of Pizza.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

VWhen you're driving from Vegas to Phoenix, this place is the 1st stop for gas/snacks/restrooms between Wikieup and Wickenburg....which is a long drive.  Therefore, if you don't plan your stops properly, it can be like an oasis in the desert at times.  There's a Jack in the Box, a convenience store, and a Mobil gas station at this stop.\u000a\u000aI give it 3 Stars for the Jack in the Box restaurant, convenience store, and gas station.  However, the bathrooms get 1 Star.  Because they're highly used, they're always trashed and nasty.\u000a\u000aParking can be tough, especially on a busy weekend.  Also, getting to the gas pump can be difficult at times too with long lines often forming, like this past weekend.\u000a\u000aUnless they build something else between Wikieup and Wickenburg, this will always be our go to stop.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 60%

VI heard about this place from a friend who said they had Beer taps on their tables...wait, what?!  I had to check this out for myself.  So, I invited a bunch of colleagues to meet after work for happy hour.  I reserved one of these tables online via their website.\u000a\u000aWe arrived and lo and behold....there are BEER TAPS ON THE TABLE!!!\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dierks-bentleys-whiskey-row-scottsdale?select=kiB0dPVKVgs_o1eS0_1xmg#kiB0dPVKVgs_o1eS0_1xmg\u000a\u000aOur server informed us that to activate the tap, we have to put a credit card down and then we can freely pour ourselves or she can pour for us.  There's an iPad on the table that's connected to the tap system that shows the consumption of each type of alcohol on the tap.  You pay by the ounce.\u000a\u000aWe were super excited and we all grabbed pints and started pouring from the tap.  We were like little kids opening a Christmas present....we had giddy smiles and big eyes...it's not hard to get a group of men excited about Beer.  We watched the meter on the iPad grow as we poured more and more Beer.  There's also a tap that has a Fireball-like Whiskey for shots....later in the evening shots happened.\u000a\u000aIn between all of the drinking, we tried the Chicken Sliders, which were very good and Fried Pickles, which looked like the Fried Silkworms in China I ate a few years ago.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dierks-bentleys-whiskey-row-scottsdale?select=3qkz8IWe_fjfTsuxy2WO1w#3qkz8IWe_fjfTsuxy2WO1w\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dierks-bentleys-whiskey-row-scottsdale?select=RaSVVf-aofwsYa4wegy2Ag#RaSVVf-aofwsYa4wegy2Ag\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dierks-bentleys-whiskey-row-scottsdale?select=CXACN95KwUK8G7GoWpWQ-A#CXACN95KwUK8G7GoWpWQ-A\u000a\u000aThe service was so/so throughout the evening.  Our server went from attentive to a disappearing act...they're really young and inexperienced here, so it's to be expected.\u000a\u000aThe vibe and atmosphere is very Old Town Scottsdale....it's a party place.  As the night goes on, the more of a party it becomes.  We left around 8 pm and people were starting to show up for the later activities.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a pretty fun place.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

I ordered:\u000a\u000aItalian Sandwich (Capicola, Mortadella, Pepperoni, Salami & Provolone Cheese), $5\u000aZapps Chips, $1.10\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/potbelly-sandwich-shop-scottsdale-2?select=jvtmuI3xq1t__d2_A0IQTA#jvtmuI3xq1t__d2_A0IQTA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/potbelly-sandwich-shop-scottsdale-2?select=fz8JYiwA92ZcW2ByFPFRVA#fz8JYiwA92ZcW2ByFPFRVA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/potbelly-sandwich-shop-scottsdale-2?select=OwWJ9p-Aax_BDkUSVTnUJQ#OwWJ9p-Aax_BDkUSVTnUJQ\u000a\u000aThere are a few things that make this sandwich shop unique:\u000a+ The Bread is thinner than most (see my pics).\u000a+ They offer Hot Peppers that are like Giardiniera...and they're hot.\u000a+ They have Zapps Chips...very hard to find outside of the South.\u000a\u000aThe Sandwich is toasted and is very tasty.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The Hot Peppers are legitimately spicy and add flavor to the Sandwich.  I love Zapps Chips and was very happy to see it offered here for sale.\u000a\u000aThe employees here are very friendly and helpful with making your Sandwich.  The only complaint is that when I asked for a 'Big' sized Sandwich (30% larger according to their website), they said they don't have Big Sandwiches yet....what?  Why have it on your website then?  Logic would tell you not to post it on your website....or at least post that it's "coming soon".  Anyway, it's not the employees at the store's fault, that's a corporate office problem.\u000a\u000aThe store has plenty of indoor seating and a small outdoor seating area as well.  I was there on a Saturday at 11:15 and it was pretty busy.  I would expect them to be really busy on weekdays for lunch.\u000a\u000aI'll have to come back when they have 'Big' Sandwich options ready.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 80%

VAnother place that has been on my hit list for a while now.  They have a location up in the Pinnacle Peak & Grayhawk area and when I heard they were coming down to Old Town, I had to come try it for myself. \u000a\u000aWe walked into the joint and sat down at the bar.  The bartenders here are very friendly and helped us navigate the menu and gave us some suggestions.  We decided to order:\u000a\u000aHot & Smokey Mac & Cheese, $12\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cold-beers-and-cheeseburgers-old-town-scottsdale-scottsdale?select=mmielx6jnDdPHjhsRq5JTg#mmielx6jnDdPHjhsRq5JTg\u000a\u000aChili Mac & Cheese, $10\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cold-beers-and-cheeseburgers-old-town-scottsdale-scottsdale?select=62XM74Smxg1lNsSu8nE2_g#62XM74Smxg1lNsSu8nE2_g\u000a\u000aCheeseburger Sliders, $9\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cold-beers-and-cheeseburgers-old-town-scottsdale-scottsdale?select=hZ5V7OBUDJSOjuQEVDinLw#hZ5V7OBUDJSOjuQEVDinLw\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cold-beers-and-cheeseburgers-old-town-scottsdale-scottsdale?select=-Ux2s-3A70ZZzw3UulAUgg#-Ux2s-3A70ZZzw3UulAUgg\u000a\u000aPrime Rib Sliders, $12\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cold-beers-and-cheeseburgers-old-town-scottsdale-scottsdale?select=teUmvafQzMflGzwqB0BUxw#teUmvafQzMflGzwqB0BUxw\u000a\u000aWhile we waited for the food, I ordered a pint of Lagunitas IPA, $6....one of my favorite IPA's.\u000a\u000aThe food came out a short time later.  The first thing I did was try the Hot & Smokey Mac & Cheese....and holy smokes, it was delish!  Not only that, but it really was spicy too...and smokey!  I also had a bite of the Chili Mac & Cheese...that was ridiculously good as well!\u000a\u000aNext, I tried the Sliders....had the Cheeseburger Slider first....also very well prepared and full of flavor.  The Prime Rib Sliders were just as good and the Horseradish Sauce was a zinger that added to the flavor!  We were very impressed with this place.\u000a\u000aAfter dinner we watched some baseball and had another Beer.  Good times down here...can't wait to come back.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%

VWe watched the commercials and wanted to come check out the new casino they built.  We popped in on a Saturday night and the place was packed!  You couldn't get on a machine less than $1.   Most of the tables were packed too....and so was the bar.  \u000a\u000aOk, so we wanted to grab a bite to eat and went to Fatburger (different review).  That was an average experience.  \u000a\u000aThe casino was very nice and well designed...very easy to find your way around.  There was no live entertainment the night we went....nothing in the lounge and nothing in the event center, strange for a Saturday night.\u000a\u000aAfter a couple of hours, we got bored and decided to leave.  The employees we interacted with were friendly despite being super busy.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 70%

VFinally!  B-Dubs returns to Scottsdale.  Ever since the location in North Scottsdale closed, I've been waiting for it to return.  They opened earlier this week and we were anxious to give it a try.  Since they were new, we were expecting the worst in customer service...there are always a few hiccups here and there during opening week....not here though!  \u000a\u000aWe were greeted by smiling, friendly hostesses who seated us at a table in the bar area.  We asked if they could put on a specific baseball game on one of the TV's, and they accommodated.  Our server gave us a run down of the menu & specials.  I threw her for a loop when I asked for an IPA, it was National IPA Day...she didn't know what that was.  That's ok, most people under 21 don't know what that is.  She smiled and said she'd ask the bartender and let me know.  She promptly returned and told me that they had Hop Knot IPA and Firestone IPA....I ordered the Hop Knot IPA first, then the Firestone 2nd...yum!\u000a\u000aFor dinner, we ordered:\u000a\u000aQueso & Chili Dip\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buffalo-wild-wings-scottsdale-2?select=35tWJX8t0jOppa8akUSfyQ#35tWJX8t0jOppa8akUSfyQ\u000a\u000aCheeseburger Sliders\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buffalo-wild-wings-scottsdale-2?select=MW6o7ZqiBpR3DI0Qdg4TTA#MW6o7ZqiBpR3DI0Qdg4TTA\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buffalo-wild-wings-scottsdale-2?select=VcPnbq9ofF80r6IdSCM1yg#VcPnbq9ofF80r6IdSCM1yg\u000a\u000aBoneless Wings, 40 cents ea.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buffalo-wild-wings-scottsdale-2?select=mZsJCccMnqgBmSE_B6RXQw#mZsJCccMnqgBmSE_B6RXQw\u000a\u000aThe food came out rather quickly and we enjoyed our dinner while watching baseball games and shooting the breeze.  Our server remained attentive the entire time and ensured that we were good.\u000a\u000aOverall, I am very impressed with their opening week.  I can't wait to come back during football season!

VVery nice gun shop.  It's fairly large and they have a ton of AR-15's, some AR-10's, and what surprised me was that they had a .338 LAPUA for sale...that's not a common gun to see in a gun store.  Hell, I only saw 1 for sale at the last gun show.  I was so tempted to buy it....but I'm saving up for a different model.\u000a\u000aThe guys here were super helpful and allowed me to check out several guns.  I'm not one who will buy right away, so I didn't leave with a firearm, but I did get several magazines and other accessories I was shopping for.\u000a\u000aI'd definitely come back and give these guys my business.  \u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 90%

VWas looking for a rental car for a quick trip to Tucson and found a great deal on Expedia for this place.  I was able to secure a full size rental for under $20 per day!  I've had bad experiences with Fox Rental before, so I was expecting the worst.\u000a\u000aThis time around, it wasn't too bad.\u000a\u000aWhen you arrive at the car rental facility, don't get confused and go down the escalator to the cars...you have to check-in at the counter on the main floor first.  If you don't, they'll just send you back up and you'll waste a lot of time.  I know this because there were several people in line at the counter who told me what happened to them and they were not very happy.\u000a\u000aFox shares a counter with a couple of other rental car agencies, so look for that.  Their line is the middle line.\u000a\u000aThe worst part of this experience was the wait in this line....it was taking 10-15 minute per customer to get through.  That's agonizingly slow.  I understand....you get what you pay for....that's what I kept telling myself.  Cheap car, cheap service.\u000a\u000aAfter a 45 min wait, I finally got through the line and then headed downstairs to pickup the car.  When you get down there, you have to wait in line again and another person has to check you in to get your car.  It's a ridiculous process in my opinion and highly inefficient.  It's shocking that companies operate so inefficiently nowadays.\u000a\u000aThe car wasn't too bad, it was a Chrysler 200 convertible and had about 40,000 miles on it....that's a bit long in the tooth for a car rental, but for under $20 a day, it was fine.\u000a\u000aReturning the car went well and there were no issues there.  I'm rating them 3 Stars overall because the pricing is outstanding and despite the slow service, I understand that the price is cheap for a reason and I can't expect outstanding service when I'm paying pennies on the dollar for the car rental compared to the rental agencies with great service.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 50%
