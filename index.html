<span class="yelp_4_sprite"></span>
<p>While I was back in Vegas for a conference a small group of us decided to drop by and grab a meal.  It was about 8 pm and it was packed and a long line of people waiting to get in.  The hostess told us it would be 1.5 to 2 hrs....wow!  We could get seated right away if we sat outside....but it was raining off/on, so we'd have to take a chance.  I walked outside and they have umbrellas, so we took a chance and chose to get seated immediately. Luckily for us it didn't rain while we dined...ha!  I ordered: Filet Mignon Merlot - (w/Butter, Red Wine Reduction) $34.95 Macaroni Gratin - $6.95....to wash it down, we ordered a bottle of Malbec for $58. While we waited for our food, it rained a little bit.  However, with the umbrellas and patio space heaters, we were comfortable and dry.  It was actually kind of cool to sit outside on the Las Vegas Strip and watch the clouds pass overhead and rain on the city.  In the 20+ yrs I lived in Vegas, I never had an experience like that.  Having Wine during the rainfall was even better. The food came out after a while and my Filet was cooked perfectly.  I ordered it Medium-Well with just a little "pink".  The Red Wine Reduction was heavenly and smooth on the palate.  The Mac Gratin was rich and complimented the Filet very well. Overall, it was an awesome dining experience.  Don't know if I can replicate the ambiance and scenario.  The waiter was super cool and handled the weather/packed restaurant situation very well. Return Factor - 100%</p></blockquote>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
